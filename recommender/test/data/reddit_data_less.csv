StonerProTips,"I probably won't pull this out if I get pulled over, to be honest.   I've never been pulled over (knock on wood), but if I did, holding or not, I'd just go through the motions until it gets out of hand.   If a cop pulls you over, asks for your license and registration, and you give this to them, it seems a bit suspicious, no?   Here's my tip: Memorize the card. If a cop pulls you over, give him your license and registration, and do whatever he asks. If he starts asking questions and you get flustered, then tell him you don't have to talk. If he asks to search, say it's in your right to refuse. If he is holding you, say for dogs, tell him he can't hold you, and if you're not under arrest, you can go. If you get arrested... You get the point.   You seem like your hiding something if you give them this and remain completely silent."
StonerProTips,"IANAL but you can't invoke your Miranda rights UNTIL you are in custody and they know they're going to ask you questions - which happens when they give you your Miranda rights and not a second before (unless they just don't give them). if they just pull you over or stop you on the street to ask you a question like they can every other person, you can blabber on about your rights and how you know them and wish to use them...but you should probably just turn around and try and walk away. the second they put a hand on you to stop you BAM - go into your speech."
TMNT,"This movie is going to suck.   (Sorry, this is going to be a bit long. Just bear with me here)   The movie is going to suck because it's a money grab. Megan Fox just said so herself - the only thing that's important is how much the movie is going to make. "Fuck off if you're not going to give us money"? OK, a bit rude but fair enough. you're not buying their product so they have no interest in you. Oh, you already gave them money, but didn't like the movie? fuck do they care if you liked it or not, they already have your money.   "Hay, let's give the turtles nostrils and lips, so it'll be cheaper to animate them using motion capture", "Donnie is a nerd, right? to show that, let's give him big nerd glasses with the thingy taped on the bridge", "April O'Neill is an annoying character that doesn't do anything and people tolerate her only because she had boobs*? Let's get Megan Fox to play her"   Well, OK, the last one was pretty spot on. But otherwise it's just about the cheapest easiest things to do, so let's not waste more time or money with making a good movie, and just have the bear minimum to get asses into seats.   And I was actually pretty optimistic lately. The first trailer was dumb, but then we saw a bit more, especially of Mickey, and I was thinking "Well, he's cheesy, but the Micky of the TV show was also cheesy, so I'll try to keep an open mind and hope the movie will be good". But this quote convinced me that the only people who care whether the movie is good or not are the fans. Michel Bay doesn't care. The director doesn't care. The 5 script writers don't care (BTW, anyone notice there's an inverse correlation between how good a scrips is and how many writer it had?). Megan Fox sure as hell doesn't care.   Basically, this is the same attitude some large corporations have - They know people are going to buy their product, so why put any effort in it?   Here's an idea - Want some TMNT this weekend? watch the 80s show, the 2003 show, the movie, Turtles Forever, read the original comics, the Archie one, the IDW series**... There's a ton of great TMNT stuff out there, where the creators actually gave a shit.   Want to go to the movies? Watch Guardians of the  Galaxy. It has all the thing TMNT should have had - great humor, nice action and characters that are treated with respect. The people who made it clearly deserve your money more than Megan Fox dose."

I did see cat lady wildenstein from a car in manhattan years ago- i absolutely could not like, say, stand in line behind her or eat in the same restaurant. I generally give zero fucks what anyone else is doing, but that plastic look scares the bejesus out of me. I could totally see myself burning these bitches with fire or stomping them out. Lol"
SurvivorRankdown,"Happy to immediately prove you wrong on the projected finish. Although reading that, I guess you'd just be happy to see her cut.   Amy/Gary top two of Guatemala is inevitable with no Judd. I think I'd hope for Gary to win, since Amy has a marginally more entertaining personality, but Gary has a considerably more dynamic presence in the season. Plus there are a lot of anti-Russell Hantz crusaders out there who like using Gary as a counterpoint to him, so there's that."
entp,"I think my most notable case of this is when I got into a fight with a drunk guy throwing his girlfriend around after a night of drinking. I pulled his attention and aggression to me after I told him to leave her alone. I didn't get overly emotional and automatically hit him (even though I partially wanted to), but tried to talk him down instead. He rushed me and a we went to the ground together. I have some amateur MMA experience and while he swung away and hit me, it was like I didn't feel anything. Pain didn't exist when he made contact with my ribs or head. I had perfect vision and control. Step 1: Get him clear of the women nearby. So I adjust our weight to roll away. Check. Step 2: Make sure he and I are away from dangerous curbs, cars, or metal in this area. Also move so he is in between his other "buddies" just in case they try to rush me. Check. Step 3 (Choice): Block or attack? Block while shouting at him to calm down and see if he reacts. Nope, too drunk and emotional. Step 4 (Choice): Attack. How much force? Throat, knees, nose, chin, and eyes all easily accessible with no defense while he's swinging. Don't want a police report where he's hurt more than I am and risk jail time or law suit. Subdue instead. Step 5: Close space to prevent heavy swings, but not enough for teeth. Step 6: Leg sweep, but protect his head before it hits concrete. Step 7: Put pressure on elbow joints using body weight and shift over to keep off balance until head lock is in place. Step 8: Position him between myself and his friends to verbally assure them he isn't harmed, but that he will be if they try to attack and wait for help until everyone is calm.   All this happened within seconds and I clearly remember it. The odd part is that it wasn't until 5 minutes after everyone cleared out that I suddenly had a mini panic attack. Adrenaline was still in my system, but left with only a memory and no physical action made me break down. I was mostly scared that the thought of having such a clear head that picked out his throat and eyes as immediate options for a potential kill shots crossed my mind so casually. My other friends that get in fights want to beat up the person to show who's strongest. I had a nearly level headed thought to severely damage or even kill him just to stop the fight."
Anarcho_Capitalism,"Its not really due to the fact that we are exceptional, its just that the small number of people present keeps the signal / noise ratio to acceptable levels.   More than anything, this is a great example of why democracy is such a bad idea. As I point out to friends / family all the time...would you allow a random walmart shopper to decide on what you should do with your life-savings? No? But thats exactly what happens when we all vote.   Moreover, as the audience becomes larger, subreddits becomes ever more attractive for the sock-puppets to appear. 10 bozos with sock-puppet accounts can completely derail any meaningful conversation."
Anarcho_Capitalism,"Wait, I ask you to merely give an explanation and supply some food-for-thought to help you understand what I am asking, and you dodge the chance to explain your position?

Anarcho_Capitalism,"Unless a fundamental change in technology comes so that it would be impossible to be in poverty and classes/money are meaningless, there will always be people in poverty.   People have fundamentally different intelligence and strength, among other attributes. Intelligence is the most important and useful factor for determining the social class that one will eventually end up in.   There are people with very low IQ's. Something like 80 and below puts you at a very high risk of falling into poverty eventually. Those people with something like <70 IQ are, sadly, simply not intelligent enough to do but very menial jobs, which will not rescue them from the grip of poverty. Some, VERY FEW, can hardly do that. It's hard for them to get hired in the first place too.   Of course, the support of family members, if they have any(and if they are not very poor too, which is likely), and charity, can keep these people from falling under the horrible spell of poverty. But it is difficult. Some just aren't even that lucky. They just fundamentally cannot overcome their lack of wealth, and have none to help him.   Even worse is that it's likely that the people born mentally retarded are probably in a lower-than-average IQ and thus probably poor area in the first place, so that charities and supportive families are hard to come by.   Which is why I hope for a sort of technological revolution (possibly a singularity) that will mean none of us need suffer due to nature's cruel tale of scarcity very much, at least, not for a while."
Anarcho_Capitalism,"Maybe he got all his knowledge of the movement from a cursory read of this article he links and didnt bother perusing the sources in the article. Maybe. Maybe not. Keep in mind the 'crypto-scientist' Mencius Moldbug is just a programmer who spent some time gather historical references and obliterating progressivism and democracies assumed benefits and 'goodness' he isn't a leader as much as a catalyst for thought.   This is an interesting article to call 'neo-reactionary'. It's an interesting concept and I recommend you give the piece and the concept 'the first citizen' a read. That said it's still asking to be functional in democarcy and it doesn't discuss any old-right or any other neo-reactionary comment. It does spend some time discussing how the president is a symbolic king, but so do libertarians.   >Why the public would accept a figurehead chosen by a slew of elected officials and appointed judges, Auslin does not say. In his view 鈥?which is perfectly typical for an armchair intellectual living in the Potomac bubble 鈥?all the people need is a shining star to follow. Behind the scenes, the government will toil away at advancing the nation. So true monarchy, this is not.   It's an ironic insult, but I'm glad miller saw what the article was about. He still thinks its neo-reactionary   >   Interesting take. Less strawmanning but sorta forgets what th left/right spectrum actually means. Secessionism shout out.   >That kind of apprehension to power is what makes for an autonomous attitude. Societies composed of individuals suspicious of authority, whether it鈥檚 just or not, tend to be more vibrant and thoughtful. Now, suspicion shouldn鈥檛 equate to rabid survivalism, but often times it does. Lewis accounts for this mindset by calling it the 鈥渁tomization and feeling of alienation that is plaguing our nation.鈥?The tacit claim is that anyone who doesn鈥檛 firmly bow down to the state are anti-social curmudgeons.   While I do make comments that libertarianism lets social discussion sort of wither and die I don't think libertarians are anti-social hermits. The thing is that neo-reactionaries are post-libertarian and take intellectual strolls into minarchism and seriously consider what beneficial system could arise from that. I imagine many are fan of nozicks ultra minimal state (which is virtually indistinguishable from Ancaps if you give the concept a read)   I don't like how the whole arguement of this piece is predicated on: suspicious citizens make the most intelligent systems so monarchy will never work. The neo-reactionaries desire a system which is tested and shown to be better or worse. They need the suspicious and the intelligent. It's the suspicious and the intelligent which are questioning the current climate.   >The idea of the crown鈥檚 return immediately turns most people off. These are individuals who like to think of themselves as independent and self-reliant. They eschew the notion of lordship, but will stand at attention like Pavlov鈥檚 dog if some brute barks loudly enough at them. That reaction may appear cowardly, but it鈥檚 not unnatural. Some individuals are simply more adept at being leaders than others. Life is full of inequities, some justified and others not. The inherent inequality in social demeanors should not be looked at as nature鈥檚 cruel joke. It鈥檚 a reality that needs acceptance. As Russell Kirk wrote, 鈥淸F]or the preservation of a healthy diversity in any civilization, there must survive orders and classes, differences in material condition, and many sorts of inequality.鈥?  Certainy good work on mr.miller has devils advocate. Gets a little out of hand near the end, but good work.   >This kind of freedom constitutes what historian David Hackett Fischer called 鈥渉egemonic liberty.鈥?That term might seem paradoxical at first, but it鈥檚 not wholly incongruous with true human flourishing...Striving to bring everyone down around you is no way to live contently. Finding peace in order is something cultural Marxists will never achieve. It鈥檚 a temperance thing.   Just started reading the anti-capitalist mind by mises and this is fits right in with it.   >The Auslinite neo-reactionary movement is a funny thing, really. I don鈥檛 know if those begging for an objective leader imagine themselves fulfilling the role. If so, the demand comes off as a narcissistic plea for their own aggrandizement. If they are willfully searching for the Remnant to lead them, as well as everyone else, to the Promise Land, that also comes off as pitiful begging. Whatever happened to doing that yourself which others can鈥檛 fulfill to your liking?   So if you find that having a king is the most effective and least damaging style of governance you are narcissistic for wanting to lead and a piece of human garbage for wanting to be lead? I think this Judgement has to do with the infestation of progressivism into every ideology that the west has to offer. Specifically the atomization of the individual. Humans have almost always existed within tribal and community frameworks. No man/woman is an island. Having a leader of your tribe or being a leader of your tribe is not the same as being a narcissist or a begger.   >It鈥檚 hard to make out what the goal is for advocates of monarchy. If what the neo-reactionaries are seeking is to be part of something bigger than themselves, there is always religion. Looking for meaning in the political is like looking for meaning in a trinket at the bottom of a cereal box. You know what鈥檚 coming, and it鈥檚 always disappointing. As Noah Millman writes in The American Conservative, the agenda of monarchists is likely driven by a fear 鈥渢hat the American people have failed and needs to be properly directed by the right people鈥?combined also with the idea 鈥渢hat existing privilege cannot be maintained without explicit resort to violence as a political principle.鈥?If that鈥檚 true, then the neo-reactionary movement is more misguided than originally thought.   There's always religion? That's the silliest arguement. They seek a governance that rewards virtue. Our current system is inherently corrupt. They aren't looking for divine inspiration in politics, they are looking for effective virtuous ruling systems (or whatever form of governance/non governance) to live in. That seems to be a reasonable and rationale goal.   Close but no cigar.   I commend this guy for not just taking neo reaction at the idea of 'geeks for monarchy' but neo-reactionary sects are determined by three main 'negative' traits   Anti-enlightenment values   Anti-democarcy   Anti-progressivism   Neoreactionaries discuss the idea of the tyrant and the monarch in ways that aren't emotionally tied to some puritanical meme that causes immediate rejection. All they are trying to do is use the perspective of the old-right to see through the lies and memes of today and craft a better world. The techno-commercialist sect of neo-reaction is in of itself a good arguement than anarcho-capitalists are neo-reactionaries of a sense,   >Human leaders will exist in this world, as long as the natural inequality in ability isn鈥檛 wiped away through violent egalitarianism. But giving over political power to someone deemed too virtuous to corrupt is just asking for trouble. Enough is known about human nature to understand the warping effect of authority. The throne might make for a more stable society relative to democracy, but it won鈥檛 guarantee prosperity.   Nothing will guarantee prosperity. I don't think neo-reactionaries think that any leader is incorruptible. There is see carlylean-esque here worship, but they just seek a system that minimizes the corruption and espouses the virtuous. There is a distinction."
Anarcho_Capitalism,"What is the leftist standard of "bigness" or "giantness" for a corporation? I have heard "20 people", "50 people", "500 people" and even "it depends". Any sort of universal size limit for a voluntary corporation is arbitrary and subjective. There is no such thing as an objective point at which a corporation becomes "too big". It is absurd to say that a corporation of 50 people should become illegal as soon as it gains one more person. It is equally absurd to forbid two people from joining; and likewise up to infinity. It is a non-violent, voluntary association of individuals. To advocate an enforced limit on the number of individuals in a corporation is to advocate the initiation of violence on non-violent people.   The free market can regulate the size of corporations without the need for arbitrary standards or limits. This is done through the profit mechanism. In general, one organization can only efficiently do so much. If the corporation wants to reap profits, the maximum size of the corporation is the size that allows it to create the most value for the consumers. Any size that hinders its ability to create value will result in a loss of profits, and if the size hinders its ability enough, it will result in losses. The corporation experiencing losses will then need to downsize."
Anarcho_Capitalism,"Some of my previous comments on this issue:   The whole net neutrality debate is a farce. The entire situation has been enabled by government granted monopolies and virtually no one in the liberal camp acknowledges it or if they do, they say that changing local government policies is too hard, thus we need a national government policy to "fix" the problem. Not that the federal government hasn't contributed to the problem, what with the FCC and all the market distortions they advocate/create.   Let me elaborate where I stand on this issue. In order for many things on the internet to work the way we expect them to, certain things need guaranteed bandwidth and low levels of packet loss (VoIP/VTC/Online Games/anything time sensitive). Other things, such as video streaming will not suffer as long as the packet loss is managable and the total bandwidth available is sufficient(This is where Netflix is having issues, the total bw is not sufficient). Other services will function very well in medium packet loss environments with reduced bandwidth(HTTP). Other services, as long as the user is not in a hurry, do not care if the BW is low or the packet loss is high, they will eventually transfer the needed date.   There are QoS and dedicated circuits/bandwidth at all levels of the internet and it depends mightily on the needs of the customer. VoIP often comes into major ISPs on dedicated trunks because it is the most sensitive to packetloss and generally needs a fairly fixed bandwidth. Gamers require low packetloss and highly variable bandwidth, they much prefer that their game traffic to XBL goes over an uncongested link. ISPs that care about retaining customers that use time and bandwidth sensitive applications will adjust their network architecture to optimize the quality of the services it things will have the greatest net benefit to optimize for. The problem we run into is that there is vanishing little competition for the last mile connection. This is thanks to local governments giving monopolies to cable/phone providers and not allowing competitors to come in. There could be a great deal of Wireless based competition, but those "rights-of-way" were sold mostly to the cell carriers, additionally there is only a finite amount of spectrum suitable for terrestrial PTP/PTMP/Broadcast use.   The cable companies have historically been sitting on a data capacity goldmine. RG6 Coax that they use carries signals ranging from 400MHz to 1100MHz. DOCSIS 3.1 modulation techniques, if allowed to use the full bandwidth available, can pump over 6Gbps down these coax lines, if the cable company wanted. Since a single CMTS(with a fiber backhaul to the CO) only serves a smaller group of customers (Typically under 200 homes), a cable company could theoretically give each customer a dedicated 30MBps circuit. With the nature of how data is used(typically in large bursts with long idle times), there is a massive amount of local bandwidth available. It would be very tempting for a competitor to come along, pay for right's of way and lay their own Coax/Fiber, starting with the more dense neighborhoods and then expanding where it makes economic sense. A new competitor may decide to forego all traditional CableTV methods and have their entire network run IP based utilizing multicast for TV where it makes sense.   My point is that if competition were allowed at the last mile, ISPs that provided crappy service would quickly find themselves with a rapidly shrinking customer base and adjust for what the customer wanted. I would love to be able to use an ISP that said, "Gaming and VoIP/VTC are our number one traffic priority, Streaming/SSH/insert_relatively_time_sensitive_protocol_here is the next highest, HTTP/FTP is the the next, P2P/BitTorrent/etc and everything else unimportant will get best effort." I use BitTorrent quite a bit, but it is rarely time sensitive and would be well worth the tradeoff to guarantee good pings in games and crystal clear, glitch free VoIP and Video Chat."
amiugly,"You're fucking striking. Your face is slightly more elongated and thinner than most peoples', but with your body type, pretty facial features, and hairstyle, it works very well. I think you're gorgeous, and I have to imagine most other guys would, too.   I think your hair looks awesome when it's down (if you have that style still), and the color was great, too. I think you'd look older if you cut it, but that's not a suggestion, just an observation. I like the look very much.   You appear to have the ability to dress up and dress down, which is excellent (nobody wants a girl who wears fancy outfits all the time; We love a woman who can throw on jeans and a t-shirt and be comfortable).   All in all, you are pretty much the exact opposite of ugly. If you want more confidence boosting, you could try r/amisexy, but be warned there will always be trolls, no matter how attractive the poster is. Also, people will probably say some creepy things haha.   On a one to ten scale, you're a solid 8.5. So if you're not getting approached by guys, chances are good that it's because you're intimidating them. If you're an admitted shut in, and hanging out at Cons, chances are pretty good that the nerds (I use the term affectionately, I'm a pretty big nerd myself) are just plain too afraid to try hitting on you.   Also, if you're going to bars and not getting hit on, that's generally a good thing. I'm sure free drinks are nice (being an average looking dude, I wouldn't know, nobody has bought me one), but as a dude, a lot of the dudes in bars creep ME out."

amiugly,"Here's the thing about make up: Yes, you look "prettier" with it. But, people get used to seeing you that way, and if they see you without it, you look strange to them. You should go a week without any make up. You are the same person either way.  Also, if you always wear make up, there will be no difference if you are going out and want to look nice... You will look the same as every day. Honestly, I'm 34 and only wear make up for special occasions. That makes people think and say "wow you look great". Whereas, if I looked like that every day, there would be no wow moment, or any difference at all.   Another thing is that guys don't give a shit about make up. They don't notice it or care. Until, they get used to seeing you with it. Then if they see you without it, something will be off about the way you look, and not in a good way. Ask any guy and he'll tell you something that took me years to notice: some of the hottest and sexiest looking females I've ever seen were wearing no make up, t shirt, jeans and a ponytail. If you present yourself in a way that makes people appreciate your natural beauty, the occasional make up will be a step up. Wearing make up all the time, makes your natural beauty (which is obvious in the no make up shot) a step down."
forestry,"About the minor in fire science and management..... I would not recommend that. If you want to get into fire then a forestry degree is quite good. The things you learn in fire science and management specifically though are just things you will learn on the job anyway.  I have a couple co workers with fire science degree's. They lament their choice. For the simple reason that in order to use their degree they need qualifications that can only be awarded on the job.  They basically will be 40 by the time they use their degree.  About the only position that a degree is worth anything is fuels specialist.  It's a great position you write burn plans and carry about prescribed burns. I feel like it would be immensely satisfying.  My last park the fuels specialist got his position after  5 years on a fuels crew, and 15   years on a hotshot crew. Then he kicked around at another park for a while and came back. He got his fire management degree  at cal poly.  He was fuels specialist for 5 years before he retired. The guy that replaced him  got sent though a certificate program at Humboldt,  paid for by the park.  Quick easy and free."
Neverwinter,"I own 4 pieces of Fatebender, 4 High Vizier, and 4 Shadow.   Fatebender: Solid dps boost, almost no group utility.   Vizier: Very underwhelming. Minimal self dps boost, negligable aid to the other group members.   Shadow: At first glance, it looks meh, but holy fuck does it add the damage to you and everyone else. AOE stacking up to 40%+ crit severity and 2k+ life steal. I run it with a 100% singularity build and it is rare that I get beat on damage, can keep packs CCd, and probably add 4-5 mill to everyone else's final numbers."
techsupportgore,"Not everyone who delves into watercooling also overclocks their computer. Some do it just because they can. Others do it for lower temperatures (which in turn translates to longevity of components), for a quieter tower, or for an interior that just seems to flow better (sorry for the bad pun).

Games,"The "everything is either good or bad" mechanic in fallout games has always been dumb.   It's dumb in every game it's in.   There are many situations in fallout games where I as a player have made decisions that, out of context, seemed brutal and horrible but when looked at in a broader sense are arguably good.   Story time [if you don't like reading skip to the end] : I was using the FWE mod and various others to make the game more difficult. I started my game as a [former] slave, and gave myself many crippling weaknesses but a few strong points to introduce challenge and unique gameplay. I wandered out of my starting point in search of water, as I was merely an hour or two away from dying of dehydration. I stumbled upon the ruins of an old town filled to the brim with raiders. The sun was setting, and under the cover of darkness I made my way around their dwellings, stealing whichever supplies I could find. I still hadn't found water, and the effects of dehydration were starting to be more adverse. As I was leaving I happened across 2 bottles. I was overcome with relief as I proceeded to sneak out of their camp. Just as I had begun to relax and feel a bit safer, I stepped over a trap and had to sprint. Just before getting out of range I took a single well-placed shot to the leg and became instantly crippled, using the shadows to get out of sight and sneak away, hanging on to life by a thread. I use the only stimpack I had scavenged to heal this wound, but because of this mod the benefit is only temporary. I will still die if I do not gather medical supplies to triage the wound and prevent any further injury.   It is about 4AM now and I have covered a good bit of distance. I need to make it to a town to see a doctor. As I make my way over a hill I see a town on the horizon, but it is doubtful that I will make it in my current condition. Oddly enough, there is a man sitting against a rock looking toward the sky, as if under a trance. I approach him and he initiates conversation with me, asking for water. I deny him, and begin to walk away. Before I do, I glance in his pockets to see if he is carrying  anything . As it turns out, he has a few stimpacks  and  a little bit of food. I decide that I will take these from him, and use the money I get from the supplies I sell to bring him back some water.   While pickpocketing the second item, he catches me and begins attacking. In my current condition I cannot take any risks, I have to fight him. I draw my blade and end his life in a few skillful jabs, and then continue making my way toward town. Along the way, I begin thinking....   "Was what I just did wrong? Is my drive for survival proper justification for ending this mans life? Do any of these morals really matter out here?" I even begin questioning some of my real life morals.. "In an apocalyptic situation, would I be willing to abandon my principles and morality for the sake of survival? Would I ever give my life for the things I believe in or don't believe in?"   Now to summarize  [SORTA A"
Games,"NCR isn't actually socialism. If you look into some of the other terminals, they are all actually pretty much the same ideals, just NCR is an more of an oligarchy, and Mr. House is the concept of a benevolent dictator. They are all actually incredibly similar, and you also missed a few endings, depending on if you decide to go with Yes Man.   The only real difference between the three rulers is the way that they rule. Both House and Caesar represent the intelligent dictator, just Caesar is looking into the future, while House is trying to rebuild the past. The NCR is too wrapped up in trying to gain control of land that they have no clue what's going on. And this leaves us with option of a free Mojave, with no dictators, and people just living day to day.   I try to think of what Moira said in Fallout 3: you can't rebuild the glass structure of the old world, but maybe you can make it into something more beautiful. The true romantic future would be to let the Mojave run free."
Games,"Thank you, this is the one of points I missed playing NV, and now to think about it, I think it's because in the first 3 games (I've have played them all)  Brotherhood was kind of the "good guys" . So when playing New Vegas, I started to see them in a different way  (bunch of loonies) , but not enough to understand why House wanted to  eliminate them  and how that actually fitted with House's character very well.   This was actually one of the reasons I chose the "Wild card" ending. But just one of many."
Games,"It's more than seeing the  names  of the groups, it's seeing the mindsets of the groups represented as well.   Fallout 3 took a  lot  of liberty with the organisations, The Brotherhood and The Enclave being the chief examples, which if you've played the first two Fallouts you'll see straight away. But even things as simple as the gangers and Super Mutants are represented in a much more black and white manner than any other game in the series.   Fallout: New Vegas shows us the old names, and then shows us what those old names have become/how they have reacted to certain situations. The Brotherhood is exactly the same as it was in the first game, the only difference being that their isolationist/zealous policies have become a massive hindrance with the development of the outside world.   The NCR on the other hand has very much progressed along the same lines it was hinted it would in Fallout 2. The only major difference I believe is the loss of mutant equality large segments of its society once preached.   I agree that the  tone  of New Vegas is fairly different in a lot of places (mainly after you hit the strip). It has been described as a post-post-apocalyptic setting (by Avellone I believe), which I think is fairly apt. I personally think this is a failing, but then I also greatly prefer the Vegas gaudiness over the Hollywood kitsch of Fallout 3's attempt at the subject matter."
Games,"For the same reason you can get a Heineken in the Netherlands for 鈧?99 while the same beer costs substantially more in the United States (and no, that's not just differences in manufacturing or shipping costs - the margins are higher).   You live in a market that is shown to be responsive to higher prices. Ideally, price and volume factor together parabolically to create a profit graph with a vertex - price too low and you're missing potential sales dollars, price too high and you move too few units. If $100 USD is that sweet spot for your region, you can hardly blame a company for sticking to it. They have shareholders.   Quite frankly, if you don't like the options you're presented with, stop buying video games. Until you do, you're just supporting their market research data."
Games,"I agree with you completely.  It took a massive and risky experiment (Steam) to even begin to lead things in a more sensible direction.  There were earlier efforts but Steam arrived at the right time with the right product.  No entrenched publisher was willing to set such a potentially-dangerous precedent, so nothing has happened.  OnLive might be another major player in the future.   Netflix is another example, and may prove to be something even more momentous if their original content programming is successful, such as with the new season of Arrested Development they're funding.   I'd cite iTunes as another example of a paradigm shift except that, while it's better for consumers, it's still terrible for content creators.  The move from physical to digital was made, but none of the savings has been passed on and as such there are still the same gatekeepers.  Their one-purchase, one-download system is also a  complete piece of shit , but that's the fault of publishers more than Apple.  Their app store however has been an unqualified success.   It will take a completely new player in the music market to finally create a new correlation between quality, availability, and profitability for the actual music content creators.  The problem is that there's no delivery mechanism.  Sirius Satellite Radio or Pandora (and similar services) might have a chance but they don't have the vertical integration to provide an all-in-one solution.   Youtube might also be able to give smaller production companies a chance to get their start if their own original programming is a success, but their history of botching product launches by providing the product first and the quality second is likely to hinder them.   The trend here is that  these are all companies that weren't publishers previously  and so they are able to see the reality of the situation, unclouded by the fear of change.  Another trend is that they've found ways to make DRM something positive rather than negative.  Steam lets me play anything I want, anywhere I want, anytime I want, for a lower price which reflects the nonexistent manufacturing and delivery costs.  This is  better than the original product .  Contrast this with UltraViolet/Origin/etc, the big studios'  debacle  solution to digital distribution, which is DRM first, profit second, customer third.   > the internet, that has been here since a couple decades, and it's here to stay.   Is it?  SOPA, Protect IP, and future bills of the same type threaten to effectively destroy the internet - and this is at a time when 2/3 of the US political system is supposedly "liberal".  Also, the structure and functionality of the internet has been fundamentally changing and improving since it was first made into a consumer product; the internet today isn't the internet 5 years ago.  Bandwidth is still far too expensive for OnLive, Netflix, and similar businesses to be economical in many places.  Speed and reliable availability also range from being beyond optimal to being almost unusable, even within the USA where it was invented."
Games,"I pre-ordered Star Wars The Old Republic the day pre-orders started. I got everything registered and was ready for the head start. When I got ready to play it kept telling me my code was already in use.   I started with support email and didn't get anywhere. On Dec 17 I made my first call. The woman said she would email me a new code. She never sent one to my email. I called them back the next day and told them what the woman told me. I gave them my support ticket number and they told me it was invalid. I asked for a new code and they told me that if I already got a new code they could not give me another. I told them that I didn't get the code and they said the ticket number was not in the system anyway. They told me to call Bioware.   I called bioware and they told me they could not help me since I bought it through Origin. I kept calling Origin and trying to get it escalated. They kept telling me there was nothing they could do and to use Bioware support since my code was already in use they could give me a new one.   On December 31 I was finally done. I called Origin and demanded a refund. They told me they could not give me one. I finally got on with a supervisor who said they could not give me a refund. I told them I was calling my credit card company to have it charged back to them and file a complaint. The supervisor finally said he would email me a new code for the game. I made him stay on the line until I got the email, registered, and was able to log in the game. I said fuck you asshole and hung up on him. Of course by this time all of my friends that I was going to play and level with were all level 30 or higher. So I had nobody to level with so I cancelled my account. Origin ruined a game for me forever that I was excited about for a long time."
Games,"My problem with it isn't that EA is making an online store. My problem is that they're using it in a manner that runs perpendicular to what it should be, and on top of that, they're trying to take market share away from steam in a way that's not right. Steam gets customers by having constant sales, releasing games without DRM, preloading, etc., whereas EA wants to steal that part of the market away from them by releasing their games only on origin. They also don't support the indie scene; steam does. Also, how many horror stories have we seen here about origin? Tons, at least 5 a week on the front page alone. As for steam? I think I've seen 2 the entire time I've been on reddit."
Games,"to be fair, those characters unlocked in previous games were generally mirrors.   These are characters with different fighting styles and movesets.   Also not to be a dick, but games are more expensive to make these days. I can think of 3 people involved in the creation of a new character at min nowadays: animator, character artist, and systems designer. This is assuming one of them even knows how to rig, or has a really efficient toolchain, and disregarding QA completely. Even then, this is a pretty optimistic pipeline for a single character.   So let's say it takes a solid month per character, and you were working 3 months on content(optimistic), and you are paying them $25 an hour that's about $144,000 right there for 4 small teams. Since a lot of jobs can be overlapped, let's plan for a straight and  very  optimistic $100,000. Again this is wholly optimistic, it will be much more with test and other jobs like concept artists, AUDIO, writers, production teams, and additional engineers, and support staff.   Ok, so the DLC will cost $20, let's assume PSN/Live will take a 40% cut because we are capcom and this is a  good  deal. We'll get $12 excluding taxes(which are another issue entirely so let's ignore it). We need to sell ~8,333 copies of dlc to break even. Now in my own(and many others) history less than 5% of your users will convert and buy dlc no matter what it is. Let's give them a benefit of the doubt and say 5% buy it. Using VGChartz we get about ~10,500 conversions.   So that's about 20% profit, which is probably the marker they planned for when deciding if dlc was even viable."
Games,"This article hit the nail on the head, in that AAA games need to have action these days and that horror is not terrifying when you can defend your self.  Dead Space 1-2, FEAR 123, RE4-5, SH Homecoming, Fallout (ghoul zones and all), Metro 2033 etc.,scares are just obstacles such that after a while you say: "Hey its awfully quiet and nothing has jumped out for a while, better reload."   The reason why games like Amnesia is scary for the common gamer is that it has taken that weapon away and you have to outsmart the enemy.   The original SH games do give you weapons, but if you keep taking monsters head on   "You will die." -Shao Khan.   So then you have to run, which gives you that tingly feeling on your neck like someones chasing and about to grab you."
Games,"Fear 3 has little to no scares and gameplay is OK. PLaying as fettel is pretty fun but its obvious they went for a more multiplayer oriented game. I bought fear 3 on release and i should have wated for it to go on sale, not worth 60, but worth 30 IMO. I had a lot of fun playing it, its still a really solid shooter, just less story and scares than the previous 2.   For sure worth $8 imo, played it once regualrly, then again as fettel. Its also a LOT more fun with a friend. Messing around as fettel is pretty sweet."
Games,"And that is, hands down, the coolest aspect of the game. It rewards creativity, careful planning, and experimenting with unconventional ideas. There is no optimum build or gear allocation. You can do things that the designers never even dreamed of and come up with a very effective build that might be unlike anything that anyone else does."
Games,"Go play Guild Wars 2, step into World vs World and watch what happens when your 100 players runs into the enemy group of 100 players.   Spoiler: You get killed by invisible enemy players and AOE because they aren't loaded up on your screen before they kill you.   The massive battles that take place in EVE would be able to take place if it was an FPS twitch combat game."
Games,"Long-term CM player here.. started out playing CM 92-93 on the Amiga, CM Italia 93-94 on the Atari.. then 96-97, 97-98, 01-02 before eventually moving onto FM 05, 06, 08 & 10. I haven't played any others since then but have put a fair amount of hours into FM10.. probably more than is healthy.   Anyway, I digress as this post isn't about that.   I went back to play 97-98 recently purely for nostalgic reasons and it was so simple.  Very simple.  Three subs on the bench in the Scottish league and one of those had to be a keeper. Hah, changed days!  What I missed most from that is being involved with the running of the club.  I love being able to take charge of training sessions, get board requests, send the scouts to foreign countries, develop youth players and everything else that 10 did.  What I hate most about it is the press conferences.  No, I like them... but what I actually hate is that you say one thing or even if you don't comment on it, and it picks that up as the main story which in turn upsets the entire squad or a player that goes in the huff.  I sincerely hope that this has been fixed for '13.  What I'm really looking forward to is the challenges.  The ones where you're bottom of the table at Christmas and have to save the club from relegation.  This has the potential to be an excellent feature and I sincerely hope that it is."
Games,"I wasn't stating anything about that. That's why I am so annoyed now, what did I do to question your philosophical views on piracy for the health of the industry?   All I did was criticize how you seem to use piracy-numbers as a metric of how well (or rather, how un-well) a game did. More piracy = more problem.  Which makes no sense. Piracy is not an anti-metric of business success. It cannot be. It's a metric of exposure, which again is an influence in sales, but this is not a transient relation, the "relates to" is not the same on both ends.   In other words, if you want to know how well or not Witcher II did, look at it's sales. Period.   This in turn erodes the "If you don't include DRM, you lose money" argument. Not including DRM can - and most likely  will  - drive up piracy numbers, though only at a fraction of hype and media exposure. But it doesn't translate to costing you sales.   I know that's not really central to the "Is piracy bad or not"-argumentation, but that's also not my point. And now I wrote way too much and got way too heated about it, sorry. But"
Games,"As an aspiring animator, it can basically be summed up as: Art is more expensive than one gives it credit for.   To elaborate,  each  character in Skullgirls is animated with hand-drawn frames, ranging anywhere from 1200-1800 frames. For  one  character. Throw in that some characters have multiple stances or modes, and that number doubles. Despite claims by  some  that art is the easiest part of game development, that's an insane amount of work and honestly, an animator at any large studio wouldn't do that kind of work unless they were being paid at least twice what the Skullgirls dev team is doing it for.   And since Skullgirls is a highly technical fighting game, a lot of work also needs to be done for getting the hitboxes right and testing it against all the other characters. Since competitive fighting is the foundation of fighting games, QA is an extremely important aspect of it. And thanks to Microsoft's stupidly expensive patching fee, the team needs to make sure they iron out all the bugs the first time around.   To give it some perspective, the Skullgirls team is working out of southern CA (think LA). For the money they're getting, they're pretty much working for slightly-above minimum wage. To put it simply, they're working in a city with one of the highest costs of living in the world for chump change. Some of the names attached to Skullgirls are industry pros and fighting-game scene stars. They could easily be working anywhere they want for far better wages. They're most assuredly doing this out of love."

Games,"I can't talk about the new game, only played the old one, but that for years. First, you need a huge amount of time to get enough RPs (realmpoints, kinda like your experience for RvR kills) to get a couple of those abilities, so specialising on one character would benefit you.   You are at an advantage when you fight an equally skilled group and yours is several RRs (realmranks) higher, thats for sure. If it is not the biggest difference though, coordination and communication are really the greater factor.   With that said, it was, in my opinion of course, the best and most rewarding PvP experience in any game I played (MMO mind you, excluding the glorious pre steam CS 1.X times). The large pvp zones where anything could happen where just so much fun. In this moment you would kill an enemy group of 8, in the next you're fleeing from a enemy "zerg" of maybe a 100 people, non stop action.   But I digress, good old memories. :)"
Games,"I also started playing OoS a few days ago, I had a blast. There's no "inferior" Zelda titles, you totally get the feeling and the experience of the rest of the titles. The only flaw I saw was the lack of more buttons, and the abuse of the START to select other items, maybe twice or more times in the same fucking screen (it's obvious that game is not meant for B and A alone) but the rest of it is pure genious. I haven't played OoA yet, but OoS seems HUGE!."
Games,"The thing is, if you just started, you are in the lower Matchmaking ratings, hence you get teammates who are new to the game and therefore generally bad with carries. I would say if you are good with carries get some wins so you can rise up in the system. I used to love playing carries from my days in wc3 dota but after a 1000 games in Dota 2, i get matched with people really good at carrying so i mostly just stick to support or gankers/nukers."
Games,"I actually feel like Dota2 have by far the friendliest community among the MOBAS (although admittedly ive only played ~50 games of HoN/LoL), probably mostly due to the commend/report system that Valve has incorporated.   Im pretty new to dota although ive played a lot these past 6 months, and my experience is that you get a lot of people either not speaking or speaking in russian/other none-english language. Then you get few who are super mean and few who are super friendly and helpful.   My advice when you meet someone raging and whining is either to mute, or to try and be the adult. To my surprise, often a simple "be nice :)" reminds the ragers that there are real people in the other end, and sometimes they even turn 180 and ends up being helpful and friendly."
Games,"WoW has been one of the only MMO's that ever offered anything remotely close to challenging content in terms of end game. I feel a lot of the success of that came from a sub-based model stemmed from the amount of time some of the mechanics of the game took to master. Much of heroic raiding for the average guild were somewhat difficult and took a decently long time to get down. For the avid PvPer climbing the ladder in Arena was simple enough but maintaining a certain high rating to stay competitive was also a bit time consuming.   It was usually all worth it to shell out $15 bucks a month especially if you never played any other game. But if they're going to a B2P or worse a F2P model, then I can see their next game hardly offering much if any of that same challenging type of end game content.   Why? Because every time I've played a B2P like GW2 or F2P like Neverwinter, it's always the same story. The leveling is fun enough, the mechanics of the game fun (if not a bit shallow) but once you get to end game there isn't a god damn thing to do.   "Well you're a 'content locus'!" This is the poorest excuse I hear all the time that always comes from the ultra casual extremist corner. The kind of player who has little time on their hands but more of it than actual skill. if anyone's played an MMO seriously enough you'll know the type. They stand in fire all the damn time, they consistently lose in any 1v1 pvp scenario, etc.. Might be nice people, but are generally pretty terrible at these games.   Those are what MMO's are shifting their attentions to and why cash shops are so lucrative these days. Why level, gear up and master your class so that you can test your mettle against some truly challenging content and actually earn those cool mounts, sweet skins, silly mini pets etc ..when you can just whip out that wallet and pay for it! That's what pretty much every cash shop in these games."
Games,"Well, there's always been two types of MMOs, EverQuest (PvE) and Ultima (PvP) games. Right now, the latter only has EVE to carry the torch, and someday maybe World of Darkness. It's disappointing that the MMO market as it originally was (and is best utilized) is being carried by one lone company. But that's better than it being totally dead.   Still, it's super disappointing that the genre has become so predictable, yet so well-known and "popular", but only from one game and one subgenre of copycats. This has led to a lot of people assuming anything WoW and its clones does is "standard", when that is not the case. People don't even question the concept of a Raid, or how inventory works, or... you get the idea. And now games like GW2 are trying to reinvent the subgenre of EverQuest clones and PvE-focused MMOs, but your interaction is still so limited because nobody questions stuff like that."
Games,"I will add a bit more info (albeit a personal touch)   I'm a father of two and I work so I don't have a great amount of time to play, which means little opportunity to grind for levels. But, and here is the important part for me, you get more EXP from doing quests than grinding mobs. Which I find great as I can get on, do A few quests and get a lot of exp rather than grind for three hours. Not to mention all the class options, free companies, quests, ability to change class on the fly rather than a new character / go somewhere to change.   Plus, I'm paying 拢22 for the game, you get a 30 day free subscription with a new game too. So in reality, it will be 4 months roughly before (including three months paid sub of course) I will have paid the same price for a generic 10 hour action game that I would blast through ad be done with in a week."
Games,"I should rephrase perhaps. I played all Mass Effect games and overall I think the story was out of order between 1 and 2. Which would ultimately affect the story of 3. I think a lot of the problem with 3 was that they wanted Shepard's story to end, which is good and what I expected. However they focused so much on the definitive end they made it so plot points matter next to nothing except whether you did it paragon/renegade.   There was potential for 3 different endings (possibly more) based on your actions. Shep can die in all of them or live depending on your actions during each ending, ala ME2. This also takes into account the reapers were almost bested by the Protheans and that even though they are of great intelligence and strength they somehow did not see the next cycle coming to fruition as fast as it did and as a result were not completely ready.     You gather the combined might of the galaxy and through conquest defeat most of the reapers.    You gather the necessary parts for the Prothean device and stop the reapers once and for all.   Shep sacs herself to lead the reapers. Leading to a question of whether they will come back or not."
Games,"The track pads are clickable. You can assign any buttons to any functions."
Games,"It depends. It has that chance, but they have to make Steam Machines compete with consoles, which I highly doubt. Also, if it's expensive, anyone can use any other console, so many people will just buy a cheaper controller.   Valve needs to compete with consoles in order for the controller to be game changing. But I doubt that'll happen because Steam Machines aren't easy to get into like traditional consoles."
Games,"No sense discussing list-style gaem journalism, but here goes: Fallout 3 over New Vegas is bullshit; Arkham Asylum deserves mention; SO MANY indie underdogs completely absent -- The Swapper is better than 75% of that list; Bioshock: Infinite is schlock gameplay with a shitty plot and deserves no spots anywhere; the first Dead Space is a masterpiece; Rayman: Origins OR Rayman: Legends (if not both) need to be in there; I'd forgive them for missing Deus Ex: HR, but Dishonored? It's one of best games of any generation."
Games,"It's important to note that cultural relativity is a fallacy. Just because people acknowledge there is a difference in culture doesn't mean they are not allowed to reasonably criticize that culture's habits if they have good reason. (Notice I said culture, not religion, there are some differences [just in case some athiest/religious/other fundamentalist reads this])   In this case, someone is highlighting the issue that carrying a firearm is more of a risk to people than the benefits. Therefore, a culture that actively accepts carrying a firearm is increasing the risk of deaths associated with said weapons.   It's pretty well documented that laws that prohibit and restrict firearms have absolutely had positive effects. Americans often point to their constitution as though the right to bear arms is the same as freedom of speech, but society doesn't work that way - it never has and it never will and the USA has ignored more important rights anyway, so why should they stop at guns?   That said, America has a broader cultural problem with their media, social problems and marginalization creating a prevalence of violence. However, this is not an excuse for lax gun laws, in fact, it almost necessitates strict gun laws in the US more so."
Games,"Ok, here's the thing is a game console worth your life? No. End of story but the thing that some people don't understand is that you have no way of knowing how far someone is going to go when committing a crime.  They obviously have no regard for your personal property, whats to say that they want to leave witnesses behind to identify them?  While some criminals want to get the loot and get out people who commit crime have a tendency to violence especially when taking things by force, so it's unpredictable what one could do especially when they've already crossed one line.   Carrying a knife isn't all that great of an idea because it's a close range weapon, if someone is a better fighter than you a knife won't do you a whole lot of good by the time you deploy it. A gun can be the great equalizer in a fight, because it gives you as much or more force as your assailant.  That being said, if you think just because you've fired a gun a few times (in real life) you're proficient with it to use it in self defense you're a fool.  It takes long hard hours of training to get to that level, just like with any other sort of weapon/self defense.   If you don't have that type of training some things are easy to ward off.  Safety in numbers has been proven time and time again, and is an effective deterrent as well as other common sense practices."
Games,"Sewer Shark is the "pinnacle" of FMV gaming.... which is the same thing as being the pinnacle of the financial crisis.  But when your young and its the only sega cd you have.....   reading your response, and your original post, it obviously comes down to - you just had fun playing it.  Which is obviously something that should be a considering factor in a game.  I was just thinking of the old GamePro review system with the 0-5 scale and the little faces, and I always remember seeing games that had "meh" faces in the graphics or gameplay categories, but 5.0 YEEEEAAAAAHHHHH faces in the "fun factor" category.  I wanted to play those games.   So I'm not knocking you guys for giving Ryse a yes, so much as I think that most games are fun to some degree, and if that is all it takes to get a yes, then everygame gets a yes.  I mean, is Killzone  really  so by the numbers that there is  no  fun to be had?  Is it really so preditcable that people really shouldn't play it?   What about Madden?  I haven't played a Madden game in 6-7 years.  I picked up Madden 25 w/ my ps4 though, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Why should someone honestly not play Madden 25?  Fans of the series generally pony up every year, if for nothing else than the roster update.  People from outside series don't see how small the jumps are each year and are bound to find something they enjoy if they have any interest in football what-so-ever.  So again, it deserves a yes.   And that is the problem with a yes/no system.  It is the equivalent of a 0/10 system.  You are either saying a game is good or it is not.  That is WAY more polarizing than simply giving a game a 5.5 or a 6.3 or whatever.  At least that kind of scoring accounts for grey areas.  A simple Yes/No is all or nothing.  I feel it undersells all the work your reviewers are doing, as they can write paragraphs of pros and cons, but at the end of the day they have to lump it all into one category or the other.   So when someone is trying to get a broad spectrum of opinions on a game, all they see is a title on a site like reddit that says, "Kotaku says you should not play Madden 25" or "Kotaku says YES to Ryse!".   If I see a score like a 5-7, I become curious, especially when there is a wide spread on metacritic of really low and really high scores.  But a simple yes or no isn't very intriguing.  It doesn't give me a reason to go read the review behind it, and as I pointed out above, it undersells games that are good at what they do - but aren't new."
Games,"As someone who has played with Firefall for a good while, I'm pretty much only going to confirm that it has a foot in the grave and people are either waiting for a drastic change of direction from Red5, or for it to die.     The first problem that a player will often come across is the UI itself. It's built using Awesomeium, an HTML-based system, and entirely relies on the web servers to modify  just about anything  about your character. This includes anything that isn't moving or shooting. Red5 has had serious issues with UI not working during times of high population, and generally feels sluggish the rest of the time.     The number of things to do is...rather limited. Outside of the freedom of doing thumpers anywhere, and the various permutations of ARES missions, you've got a grand total of...nothing. Fighting for area control against the chosen feels lacking, invasions happen infrequently, and crashed LGVs/crashed thumpers feels like grunt work (pays like it too).     ARES missions are limited by the few basic goals (blow up the enemy spawning things, disable the bomb, steal/retrieve the datapad/important supplies), the few factions (chosen, arahna, bandits), and a couple of random events (giant creatures). After you've done a few ARES missions of each type, you've pretty much done them all and you'll wish you could turn off notifications for them.     Thumpers suffer from a similar problem. The area you thump in determines what kind of enemies will spawn (arahna, chosen, skivers, and hissers), while the size determines what the waves look like. Every time you put down a thumper in a spot, you get the exact same waves of the exact same enemies coming from the exact same spawn points. As cool as the concept might be, actually doing thumpers isn't that fun.     The economy deserves special mention for its ludicrous execution, even with Red5 allegedly having an on-staff economist. Crystite trickles into the world, and there are a wide variety of ways to spend it. Resources, however, are pretty much poured into the world by the shovelful and barely consumed. Even better: there are a small number of spots that one can place a thumper that doesn't spawn any enemies to attack it. To my knowledge, Red5 has not done anything about it.     The reason for that is because not only do crafted weapons take a very long time to deteriorate, usable (and often as good as or better than crafted) gear is available as a drop from almost everything you fight. I would also like to note that when I say "a very long time" I mean a  VERY  long time. Much, much longer than it takes to recollect the materials.     The market is a mess. Someone who is looking to sell a piece of equipment has to compete with the dropped gear (which generally isn't possible). Buyers can only very rarely get the information they need to make a purchase (because of the UI problem). The most marketable item is actually thumpers, and I wish every item in the game had the kind of market that thumpers enjoy: no quality modifiers, and the death of the thumper is the loss of the item, giving sellers a steady market. Why can't equipment be like that?     LGVs (motorcycles) are locked behind a large grind wall (or for only $5.99...), battleframe progression eventually hits Korean MMO-levels of grindy, dropships are unpredictable, some projectiles are still buggy, and development just seems like a crawl as they rework something for, like, the third time..."
Games,"You really need to get to higher levels to fully appreciate the depth of PoE combat.  As the other person said, when you start getting attack speed, movement speed, life leech, projectile speed, cast speed, and support gems like multistrike, chain, fork, pierce, multi-trap, faster casting, melee splash, and hundreds more I am not thinking of...that simple skill you used on the beach which felt slow and sluggish will turn into a gorey bloody mess of corpses and destruction later in the game."
Games,"Sadly it's human nature.   There is surprisingly very little separating a well behaved public from one full of assholes. Since things like mob/herd mentality, dangerous of crowds etc.  Also the idea that if all the laws were taking away, how many people would quickly revert to criminal behavior. We are social animals largely, and society conditions/dictates our behaviour to a large extent.   The internet is just another example of that.  When you aren't infront of someone in person, can't see them face to face, its' much easier to be a jerk. You never see them cry, never see the sad looks on their faces, never get to experience empathy. (It's actually quite difficult/challenging for a properly socialized person to be an asshole and make someone else cry, without feeling pretty crappy yourself).   People often cite anonymity and a lack of consequence. But you even see this shit on facebook, with real names and real consequences (all your friends can see it) yet it still goes on.   Basically we all think plenty of dumb shit. But we mostly don't say that stuff in a crowd for fear of being embarassed and/or called out on it. We don't want to look dumb, to look stupid. Have other people stare at us and make those faces. Outside of the occasional outliers, most people have an immediate aversion to that sort of thing.   But once you are on line, people lose their filters. Because you never have to get embarrassed, you never have to have that (apparently) key face to face interaction, if you say something stupid you can always just shut off the computer and walk away. Even if that isn't true (eg. twitter death threats or whatever, that can get the police involved and have serious consequence) it's how we innately seem to view human-computer-human interaction.  It doesn't feel "real" to us (in a subconscious way?) and so all the usual social norms for expected behaviour go out the window.   That's my pet theory anyhow."
Games,"They made quite a few mistakes and hit quite a few roadblocks. That's a simple truth. The game hasn't been cancelled, rocket didn't "ditch" it. There wasn't any place for him. He said himself that he was the type of guy who got things started and then passed them to those who could do it better than him. He said the game was inherently flawed because that's correct, so now they're going back to the basics and working there way up."
Games,"I doubt this took an insane amount of resources or time. They also have tens of millions to put into the game. This type of advertising can bring more support money in."
Games,"I played the beta and loved figuring there would be more to the game, but there wasn't it was just like the beta. I think the biggest problem is lack of story and interesting charecters . I see people compare Destiny to borderlands and halo. But halo had a story and interesting charecters as did borderlands. The best parts of destiny are the visuals, sound and gameplay. I agree witg Joe in that people have been defending this game since launch when it comes to content. Destiny has less variety than any mmo I've played . It reminds me of assasins creed 3's main story where 80% of the missions were tailing missions except in destiny its 80% defend missions. I don't wanna here how difficult it is to build a world like this and how I'm asking for too much when games like GTAV and the Last of us were able to give as much content as Destiny with equally stunning visuals on last gen consoles. Even games like skyrim and  borderlands 2 that came out over 2 years ago have more content than destiny. I did enjoy it somewhat, mostly in the crucible, but it feels unfinished and broken."
Games,"AC 4 should honestly just be called Pirate's Creed. The assassin's thing is barely 10-20% of the story, with most of it being sailing around (which admittedly is really well done and a lot of fun for a while) and trying to get booty.   I was a little disappointed by the lack of an assassin's theme in an AC game, but as a pirate simulator it's definitely a 9/10. The story takes a while to really get going, but it's interesting nonetheless.   A lot of people that disliked 3 seem to love 4. The protagonist especially is a lot more interesting, which was the main criticism of 3."
Games,"Wow, only TWO WHOLE HOURS to get your money's worth?   Yeah, I don't know what vendetta you're trying to pull here, but people typically don't play for only four hours a  MONTH . The average user (even casual player) definitely plays enough that playing WoW is more efficient than seeing a movie. There are roughly 730 hours in a month. Four hours is roughly 0.5% of the month's time. Let's assume a 30 day month and 8 hours of free time (8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work)  every day . That's 240 hours of free time in that month. Four hours is only 1.6% of your free time then."
Games,"No no no, that way lies only pain and heartbreak.   Letting people "decide" what content stays or goes with their upvotes is actually a pretty terrible system for a lot of reasons. The folks over at /r/TheoryofReddit made a [short story]( detailing some of the flaws of such a system."
Games,"That doesn't make it a boys club and that has 0 to do with diversity. Also in all the dialogue promoted, I never once hears this as a reason from the women's side.   Then you're not listening very hard. It's been said by many of the most prominent women in the field, like Julie Ann Horvath, Gina Trapani, or Sara Chipps.   > Sure the work environment needs to be more respectful of employee's personal life. But long hours != boys club. What would be a boys club would be Goldman Sach employee's calling women trying to enter banking as bimbo's That's a boys club.   That isn't what I was saying. What I was saying is, the games industry in general is going to go slower in getting more women than men because of societal issues + long hours. That wasn't me saying that's what makes it a boy's club, it's just saying that the boy's club issue isn't the only thing standing in the game's industry's way- there are broader issues too.   > and it does piss me off that no one promotes these successful women in their attempts to shame the industry as a boy's club   Once again, maybe it's because you're still in school, maybe it's because you're not looking at the right communities, but the tech industry as a whole has quite a few people talking about this. In fact, it's been one of the most frequent topics of discussion over the last year, and part of the reason so many companies are releasing demographic information of their employees now.   > Up until the 80's they made up 40% then it dropped to 17% when the field started to be heavily stereotyped (being one of the theories) Where those in the field were cast as unsociable losers. My CS professor she comments on this a lot, how when she was going through her degree the common perception of the industry were nerdy unsociable boys with non-existent hygiene. Where she'd get comments from other women asking how she puts up being around those types   This is part of the reason, but it's hardly the only one. It's also because of marketing, and the societal belief back in the 80s that women's work wasn't so technical as much as it was organizational, administrative, or communicative. This in itself wasn't so much something the tech industry created- once again, society at large caused the issue- but regardless, it helped create the circumstances that we now are paying for.   Also it should be added, there was a  lot  of entertainment media at the time that reinforced the belief that women don't belong as coders(Weird Science, War Games, etc. In the latter, re-watch it, the premise itself isn't the causal point).   > A change in behavior is needed in the industry but it's not from men. women need to actually support other women in their field and prop them up. So they can actually toss out the dishonest stereotype and encourage women to come back to the field instead of discouraging them by constantly stating how unwelcoming the field will be if they try   Some women don't support each other, this is true. But on the other hand, many,  many  women say that the only reason they stayed in the industry is because they got the support of those around them, men and women both. And currently, when you have major industry events constantly having sexist tropes or content in them, startup after startup having CEOs or policies that abuse women, and women who  do  speak up get harassed to kingdom come, then no, I do think the onus is on men. We're very much part of the problem, and absolving yourself of any capability to do something about it makes you a prime example of what so many of the women who are speaking up say about it.   Edit:  Or"
Games,"Then you're not listening very hard. It's been said by many of the most prominent women in the field, like Julie Ann Horvath, Gina Trapani, or Sara Chipps.   Yes they experienced assholes and some guys that created a single sexist app in the sea of millions of apps.   However I do listen to my professor who has been in the industry a lot longer than them.  I listen to the girls i know working at/with Obsidian, at blizzard.  I prefer to listen to them rather than ignore them in favor of the opinions of women i've never met.   I also work close with my college's STEM club chapter and our biggest issue getting women in the club isn't sexism or it being a boys club, it's been the 2 female presidents we had pushing every girl out that they felt were in it  for attention  rather than had a passion.  Which is a problem with the these fields themselves, gaming and tech.  It's not a sexism lack of diversity issue, it's just everyone with a passion tries to shove out anyone who doesn't share that same level of passion.  The first women president admitted this to me, she tried to push me out of the club because she felt I wasn't interested enough but I proved her wrong.   >Once again, maybe it's because you're still in school, maybe it's because you're not looking at the right communities, but the tech industry as a whole has quite a few people talking about this. In fact, it's been one of the most frequent topics of discussion over the last year, and part of the reason so many companies are releasing demographic information of their employees now.   my experiences aren't specific to school, but I do respect my professors opinion greatly because of how long she's belonged.   I'm not sure what you mean by not looking at the right communities. So the only  right  communities are the ones that confirm this rhetoric and me paying attention and associating with communities that don't fit the narrative is wrong?  Rather wouldn't that be evidence that this isn't a sweeping problem by rather a pocketed one?   As a guy in tech and gaming i've been exposed to plenty of assholes and they're hardly represented of the community.  They're the cliche stereotype.  It's just they are noticed more because they are loud, you don't notice the hundreds of interactions with sensible players but you'll notice and remember that single asshole each time.   >Also it should be added, there was a lot of entertainment media at the time that reinforced the belief that women don't belong as coders(Weird Science, War Games, etc. In the latter, re-watch it, the premise itself isn't the causal point).   Which I don't buy into because all the same media and social pressure actively discouraged men from those endeavors as well. The same pressures that turned those that pursued those area's into social outcasts.  Those social outcasts than built the world around us and the culture that developed was built to support those type of people.  And then the culture hit mainstream and rather than fess up that society has treated these people terribly, instead they decided to attack the culture for not being inclusive.  Tropes in video games are held to the light as an example of prevalent sexism in video games to shame the originators of the culture.  When in actuality they are just shaming the fantasy's of some social outcasts.  And this is why I don't buy into the current B.S.  Sure we need to talk about the unwelcoming nature of the industries cool, how about we talk about the toxicity that has come from outside the industry as well.  It's never left, the same attitudes permeates under a different banner.  It's no coincidence that  neckbeard  rose in popularity as a negative term, as  nerdy  &  geek  transitioned from their negative connotations to positive.   >and absolving yourself of any capability to do something about it makes you a prime example of what so many of the women who are speaking up say about it.   i'm not sure how i'm absolving myself of doing anything, when I state I would rather prop up and hold successful women rather than attack tropes in the culture.   >Edit: Or"
Games,"Future of PC looks okay.  Although to me it always seemed that it was okay.  Problems that i see - AAA-games will be shirtports 80% of the time. There were shitports before too, but when shitports came from 10year old hardware, shittiness was not that noticable. Also this recent trend that florished with newgen. The one about 30fps being cinematic and so on. Before current gen it was more like a needed sacrifice and people accepted it. This would be exclusive console problem, if shitports were not shitports, but they are. So 30fps on PC gets more common. Not nice, but fuck those who do that shit.  Unexpected but nice is the japanese devs' decision to get some games on PC. Also kickstarters for VNs that were funded very quickly are also good thing, but that's not exactly PC issue, since they don't come out only on PC."
Games,"Well this kinda depends on the game.   For example I just started playing Oblivion recently and with some mods it looks pretty damn good. Id say half the age it actually is. And it would be even better if I had a better computer that could handle the better mods. Plus its extremely easy to mod,even for noobs like myself.   But im also playing the first Mass Effect which even at maxed out settings, doesnt look that great. And im too scared to even try and mod it since it doesnt have a Mod Manager like Oblivion."
Games,"Well, in regards to poor preparation, that was a comment I made about the Kickstarter campaign not doing very well since I launched it about 3 weeks ago. I fully believe that I didn't prepare for it like I should have. I had been working on such a long project, that when I finally completed the game, I was ready to show it to the world via kickstarter. This is where I messed up. Instead of getting overly excited, I should have stepped back and attempted to generate some talk about the game. Maybe reach out to some blogs or game sites and get the name "zombie refuge" out there. That would have been the best approach to a successful kickstarter campaign - generating interest before launch. I did the opposite. I launched it and tried to generate interest. So thats where I was going when I used the words "lack of preparation".   As far as motivation goes. It is SUPER HARD to stay motivated on a 2 year long project when you're working ALONE. It just is. More often than not, I felt like I was just wasting my time. I felt like no one would be interested in playing this because it is a little bit different. I'm a super ambitious person too, so wasting time on something that might fail was a big struggle for me. However, a lot of things you do in life MIGHT fail, so I decided to not let that stop me. I decided I had more fun and learned more things in creating this game than anything I had done before, and that was all I needed. Yes, there were still times when I went weeks without touching it, but I always came back. I wanted to finish it, so I did.   I talk about the kickstarter "funding" my motivation in a more generalised way. I think deep down, I just wanted to know someone cared, someone was interested. I wouldn't go as far as saying I don't think that anymore, because it's an awesome feeling to know some other person is rooting for you and generally interested in what you're doing. However, I would say my outlook on a lot of things having to do with this game has changed. The game has slowly developed from a project to something I'm more passionate about than I ever thought I could be. Phase III of the game has already started, I have already started working on additional features. I have had roughly 70 people sign up for the game since launch and when it comes to motivation that was more than enough. If I have even half of those people interested in what my game has to offer, I completely want to continue development - as I have been. At this point, motivation is hardly a concern for me. If I continue to work alone, there will likely be times where I may go days or weeks without touching the code, but I will always come back - I've already shown myself that. I just have too much fun working on it.   I think most of my rewards were fairly obvious that I wanted people to get involved - AND PEOPLE HAVE! I'm too far along to give up now. I want to finish it. I want to complete it. I'd wager to say I'll likely add more features as time goes on."
Games,"Alright, let me try to simplify it a bit - from what I can remember at the moment. A bit early-game spoilers from the first 2 games below, so beware.   Also, remember this, there are like almost 10 books set in The Witcher universe, written by Andrzej Sapkowski, a polish author, and the games are HEAVILY based on those books. Almost all main characters in the witcher games were in the books. And the books are fucking good.   You don't need to know anything to enjoy the games. They are very good at slowly inviting you into the storyline/lore. Reading the books and/or playing the previous game(s) just gives you the 'cherry on top' moments like "Oh yeah, it's that chick that Geralt banged in Oxenfurt medical school before chopping some assassins into pieces while enroute to some old shaman/witch doctor without teeth. Sweet!"   In Witcher 1 you basically are this middle-aged dude - named Geralt (of Rivia, lol - sweet moment from the book ;) ) - with amnesia who arrives half dead at a ruined castle. Turns out, that you are a member of an ancient (and almost completely dead) order of witchers - outcasts of society, who were turned into superhuman mutants by using sick ass drugs and bad mojo magic (which kills most of the 'candidates', but nobody cares 'cause they only 'use' orphans and whatever society spits out and doesn't give two fucks about)   The starting point is that you have amnesia and you want to recover your lost memories. And The game begins as you are thrown into the brutal game-of-throne-ish politics of the world with an attack by bandits that want to kill all the left-over remnants of the witcher order. The games has a prologue,  five chapters and an epilogue. It introduces you into the world and basically sets the stage for the second game. There is a lot of fun things in this game world - war, racism, wild beasts, even wilder human-killing-and-eating monsters, murder, political murder, political mass murder, assassins and whores. The writing is the strongest part of the game as the mechanics of the first game are average at best. Oh, and you also get collectible stylish hand painted cards for every woman you bang in the game.   The Witcher 2 begins as you have kind of 'unwillingly' become a sidekick to one of the major 'players' in the political scene of this world. There is a LOT of politic-related plot points, so if you like this kind of thing then 'yay'. Oh, and it's the fun kind of politics - assassinations, mass murder, rebellions, dragons, power plays. From the perspective of having just finished the game again a few days ago, it's a great prelude to the third game, at least story-wise. The game has 16 possible endings. SIXTEEN ENDINGS. If you wish, you can see some fucking grim shit, and I'm not even talking mass murder - I'm talking torture by gouging out eyes of helpless characters - not innocent ones (not gonna spoil this one!), but still.   The game looks fucking amazing, even today, the monster design alone beats Dragon Age: Inquisition to the ground. There is a free combat-rebalance mod that makes the combat pretty fluid and fun. Oh, you still can bang chicks left and right, but I don't think you get porn-art styled cards for it this time /sadface.   Answering your question directly ("
Games,"I love Mass Effect series, and i tink we need more epic sci-fi games. But TBH, i do not believe that Bioware can make ME4 at least on the level of ME1-2. Everithing after ME2 looked kinda weak and non-interesting for me (and ME3 was so rushed to realease that its hurt the game) at least not really interesting (it was onle DA3 i suppose?).   Anyway, with current management from EA, and without co-founders, i do not believe nex ME will be good game. Plus, i really want more personal adventure in ME universe, not saving galaxy again, but knowing Biware i think they will stick to classy formula - some crazy thing want to destroy galaxy, make a team of some cliche characters and make some sex with them and also maybe save the world (Bioware forums make it looks like this is what really their fans are interested."
Reformed,"Have you tried bringing it up and discussing it?   I personally don't think someone "Just isn't there yet" is a sufficient reason to ditch them... Every single one of us is at a different place in our Walk - the odds of you finding a partner who is exactly where you're at is highly unlikely and just unrealistic and it is that kind of ideal that is causing much pain these days in the dating world.   Someone's relationship with God is very personal to them and we are all easily defensive about our own; however we are called to go to each other and confront sin where we see it in humility, love, and grace. We want what's best for our brothers and sisters and leaving someone in their sin, without ever bringing it up to them, expressing your concern, or trying to come along side them in it is not loving at all.   I think to leave her without ever going through the discomfort of working that part out with her would be unloving and not very Christ like. It's probably why you were hurt when it happened to you. Christ confronts us constantly but allows us to grow and make mistakes and He is patient and gracious with us... are we not to do the same to others? Especially those we are romantically and intimately involved with?   I would bring it up before making up my mind that it's over. It will be uncomfortable and very awkward but you can phrase and navigate it to be more of a dialogue. -Be humble -Be kind -Be gracious -Be loving - as Christ was, is, and continues to be with you... -Ask questions - get to know the roots of her rebellion or lack of interest in Christ and deal with those.   If after all of that she still has no interest in pursuing a life more intimately acquainted with Christ,  then  you break it off and that is most definitely a sufficient reason to. (I bet she won't want to be with someone who does anyway - your incompatibility will be much more obvious - so breaking it off will be much easier at that point).   The reality is, you will never find a Christian (yet alone a human) significant other or spouse who is simply going to "fit" your life and desires right off the bat. Successful relationships take work, they can be uncomfortable at times. I'm convinced relationships are designed as catalysts to our sanctification. Nothing displays our selfishness more, can convict us more, can hurt us more, can make us think more, can challenge us more than our relationships with one another.   "Love God, love your neighbor. They will know Me by your love for one another..."   Christ takes relationships very, very seriously... so should we."
ArtisanVideos,"Depends on the type of wood-glue used. There are potentially toxic formulas such as urea-formaldehyde resin which can degrade over time in the presence of heat and moisture. This would not be safe to use for something like a cutting board which is often subjected to such conditions as heat and moisture.   Non-toxic solutions like the epoxy formula used by  Titebond  is a must. Acids like vinegar or those found in fruits/vegetable could also potentially break down the wood-glue if left to sit for extended periods of time, so the board should be washed soon after use.   Wood by itself is a mixture of two major ingredients: simple sugars (glucose) linked together in long chains to form cellulose, and also lignin, which is a complex of linked aromatic alcohols. Both of these types of molecules are polymeric in nature, meaning they are comprised of a specific ratio of various smaller compounds. Wood-glue is also a polymeric formulation meant to mimic the structural qualities of naturally produced wood polymers. These glue polymers can be synthetic, i.e. cyanoacrylate, or naturally derived, i.e. [animal glue]( either way, they tend to be stronger than the polymers found naturally in wood.   Glue becomes toxic when it degrades into the simpler components of its polymeric structure. The urea-formaldehyde resin I mentioned earlier is composed of urea and formaldehyde molecules arranged in a specific pattern which is not readily toxic. However, when this polymeric structure begins to break down into its component parts, the carcinogenic properties of pure formaldehyde become apparent."

This is good stuff, to be more outgoing and talk to more people - but for what reason. Seriously if you don't need any more friends, then by all means hang out with the people you already know. A strange bonus is that you'll make friends anyway.   EDIT: It's also common for everyone to talk to who they know simply because they're more comfortable being around people because (insert reason here), but you can learn to be comfortable around strangers if you'd like.   It's good you want to change, but firstly what's wrong with who you are now? I'd say it's obvious you haven't thought much about this, because you're going about it the hard way.   Changing yourself isn't always a fun thing to do, but making change an ultimatum makes the process much more difficult to accomplish. Figure out who you are first, then you'll be better prepared to devise of a way that allows you to meet more people, a way that actually suits your style. Then talking to people won't suck as much."

seduction,"Playing into this idea - You know what REALLY helps drive this idea home in your head?   Go out with a desperate chick. Like someone who might not be a very high HB, or even someone you're that attracted to. Just make it your goal to make a physical close (K or F).   Really. Allow me to explain.   When I was starting, I got a random Plenty Of Fish message from a chick who had a pretty profile pic (face), but something didn't seem right about her body shots. I got the feeling that she was a "fit" person who used to be morbidly obese. I was correct.   So what I was left with was a REALLY confident woman that REALLY wanted something...a boyfriend? Sex? She was desperate. It took me about 2 messages to smell the desperation on her, but honestly, I just wanted to meet some new people and have fun.   So we went on a date, I didn't feel 100% about her, but I knew she was 100% about me. We kissed, and it was a great boost to my esteem.   So on the 3rd date, I F-closed and it all clicked into place. It was all it took.   What exactly "locked in?"     I was now aware of the subconscious behaviors that I possess when I truly believe I'm awesome. Posture, eye contact, and yes, that feeling that I'm better than anyone else in the room.     There was no pressure. I didn't have to sell myself to this girl in order to get with her. I was myself, I had strong inner game, and I truly felt like I was the better person of the two of us.     More than anything, this experience gave me the opportunity to tune my whole tactical approach to this feeling.     I learned that I only have to worry about one thing: How the hell am  I  going to have fun tonight? Do you wanna know what my date was on the night I F-closed this chick? I flew in from Las Vegas (business trip), had her swing by my apartment, and I took her to a not-so-well known deep discount store in our city that has crazy deals, but everything's new. Oh...and a Sam's Club.       It was what I wanted to do, and I made it fun. She saw I was having a good time picking up bulk packs of Slim Jims, and she wanted to be a part of it (warning - shopping is fucking boring, and I'm not pretending to be some master here. I needed to get some shopping done, and I asked her to come along)."
seduction,"I posted this response to the same question in /r/askseddit. It's a bit different from most of the advice already posted here but it's just my take on it all: > Yes, you can pick up girls at a gym. BUT you should tread lightly. Many girls (guys too even) treat their time at the gym as "me time" and don't like being disturbed. Gym pickup takes some time. You can't look like a dude who's there just to talk to chicks. You're there to work out. Be a regular. Know the staff, and know which girls are regulars too and which ones aren't.   > Remember that gyms are a very different pickup atmosphere because the girls there aren't dressed to impress. They're in workout clothes and sweaty (but sometimes they're dressed sexy), and quite often they're wearing headphones. Many guys who try to pick up girls at gyms try to correct them on their form or ask if they need a spot. In my opinion this shit is obnoxious and comes off as trying too hard. And sometimes you'll just sound like a meathead.   > Try priming the girls first. Smile at them, make eye contact, etc. Don't ambush them, don't follow them, and DEFINITELY don't stare at them. When you get a chance to talk to her, you can start off with easy smalltalky stuff like "what are you working out today?" or "training for something?"   > She may or may not be very responsive, but if she is, be sure to introduce yourself right away. Something I like to do is ask if she plays racquetball or squash and if she does, I'll invite her to play with me in the future. If she doesn't, I'll offer to teach her. If she does engage with you, don't just talk about gym stuff. Get to know her a bit, and get her number ASAP, then say "great talking to you, gotta get back to my workout now." The gym ain't no place for long conversations!"
seduction,"Conversation ensued about which president you'd be--I'd be JFK, of course.   I don't know how to say this, but JFK's term didn't end very well.   > "Dude, that girl was ugly. I give you no credit for talking to them, she's fucking engaged. You got nothing out of it, what a joke."   This is just bitch talk.  The fact is, society teaches guys that their value is tied up in the type of women they can "pull."  So guys get very emotional and defensive when its clear that you have a skill at getting girls that they don't.  That's why so many guys get douchey and defensive when they are criticized here on r/seddit. Your friend is just projecting his own fear and insecurities on you.   You did great.  You had no idea those girls were engaged when you approach them and you still made some new friends.  That's awesome.  And also, if the engagements falls apart your dick will have first priority for her mouth.   Being able to approach random people is a great skill to have.  If you move to a great city like New York or LA, you can meet a lot of really awesome, interesting people just by approaching.  When I lived in New York I would sometimes approach guys I thought looked interesting.  And I'm totes not gay.  I met a lot of really awesome, cool guys.  One night I met a guy who owned the largest tie company in America, and he invited me on his boat the next day to party with models.  It was awesome.  One night I thought I had a date with a girl and she brought a dude friend over.  Instead of getting angry, I befriended him and guess what -he invited me on a boat to party with models the next week!!   In fact, there are some articles that say that one of the main reasons that women get paid less than men is that they never learn the art of approaching random strangers (in the dating world), so they are less likely to approach and ask for favors, raises, promotions, etc..., and they are shittier and finding new clients and business prospects.   So,"
seduction,"How do I get this message across without making it too obvious?   Don't. Your value is inherent. You're not trying to sell yourself to her. Just answer the question with pride. It's up to her to figure out why you're proud of something that others would be ashamed of. If she's not interested in doing that, she's not interested anyways."
seduction,"There's no shame in spending time reading and more importantly understanding what you read. Being a keyboard jockey (KJ) while you figure this stuff out may not necessarily be a bad thing; the reason why people condemn keyboard jockeying is because they only stay in theory mode.   I spent a year as a KJ to understand the differences in styles of the different systems, find the similarities and then figure out how that works into my identity and personality. Granted, I could wear a funny hat, spew cocky funny lines, or just insult girls without understanding the concept of negging until I finally got it right but it seemed dumb to me to do something without understanding.   Think of it as learning to drive. You need to learn the rules of the road, how to read the signs, how to operate the car, then get in the car and actually learn to drive it.   In PUA context, the Mystery Method Model or M3 system as some people refer to uses 3 main stages to guide a pickup.     Attraction   Comfort   Seduction     This model is used almost universally, and makes a very good framework. The "HOW TO" for each stage may differ from teacher to teacher, system to system, but they all revolve around a few key concepts from what I have understood. e.g. Showing value is one of the main ways to build attraction used in many systems."
seduction,"This is a great question, and I'd have to say it was a build up for me, with some nights having bigger steps than others. What's unique about the CYC material is that it teaches you ways of creating your own group by way of activities, parties, and campus life. You learn how to become and maintain alpha status with the group and inspiring people to come to you whenever they want to have some fun. The bar scene at college is different than any other bar scene in that because of how tight the social environment is at college, the entire bar must be considered a single set. Because of this, going out to the bars is not a good way to  try  to meet women, it is a lot better to think of bar hopping to be an activity that you and your friends do. You go out and have fun, and in college, the people that do this are sought out. The women will come to you, through introductions, through proximity, and through curiosity. Also, your social calendar will start to fill up as you attract connected people and you are invited to events and parties.   I realize that I didn't directly answer your question, since I don't see the bar scene as a large portion of my game. I actually much prefer house parties, much more intimate since everybody  has  to be connected to be there. However, what really clicked at the bar scene for me was when I shed all approach anxiety. If a girl gives me any IOI, its now a reflex to smile and say hello. If I see something that I think is crazy, I don't tell my friend 15 feet away, I tell the most interesting looking person right next to me, and if its a hot girl, I'm all the more excited to let her know. Basically, you want to talk to everyone in the bar as if they're part of your set; because in college, this is the truth.   I had a real stroke of luck very early in learning game that taught me some of the most important facets of bar game in college, especially in respect to social proof. Coincidentally, this was another 21st birthday party, and I went with a yet another large group of girls, of which I knew about 5 or 6 of them. I wasn't just drinking that night either, I was trying for the first time partying on aderall, which for those who are familiar, can make you really chatty and sociable. [ I strongly urge you NOT to use drugs to improve your game. Not even alcohol. My rule of thumb for drinks is 2 an hour, any more and my game suffers ] So with the drinks, the drugs, the large group of friends I was with, I had a lot of people to talk to, and soon enough I just started going through the entire bar talking to every set whether I knew them or not. I was having a blast and it was noticeable to anyone watching. As the bar was approaching close, I slowed my roll and was standing chatting one on one with my roommate and best friend. While we were talking, someone taps me on the shoulder and I turn around to see two good looking girls, a shorter smiley blonde, and a tall shy swede. I could tell instantly that they were even a little nervous to be talking to me, but I was real excited to meet them. It took them less than 5 minutes to ask my roommate and me to go back to their place with them, and if I asked you to use your imagination for the rest of the story, you probably wouldn't be too far off. ;-)   So"

okc,"Oklahoman turned Chicagoan here.   To echo other respondents, what is it YOU are into? Rather than taking a piss out of your new place of residence, how about taking a positive perspective and seeking out opportunities to enjoy yourself. I'm sure your new employer would appreciate the attitude adjustment. Not trying to be a dick, I'm honestly suggesting that keeping a positive attitude can/will improve your life experience.   Sports and drinking are definitely viable options, not just for things to occupy your time, but opportunities to meet other folks. There's also incredible indoor rock climbing in Bricktown, outdoor activities like mountain biking, hiking, camping (although many of these require leaving and heading in almost any direction).  There's a thriving art scene, tons of volunteer opportunities, lots of museums (Cowboy HoF fucking rules, Clown Museum, Nat'l Softball HoF, etc), several movie theaters and malls. Hell, even the zoo is great. Hot Air Ballooning? Archeology? Native American studies/culture? We got your ass covered.   But, if you're into deep sea fishing, you're fucked. We don't have that here. But, I'm you can find a SCUBA shop or two. And the Hong Kong Station sushi is in-fucking-credible. Seriously! Sushi! In Oklahoma Fucking City! I shit you not, sir.   For whatever reason, OKC gets a bad rap by everyone not from here. Sure, you drive through the state, some asshole cops gonna pull you over. You decide to HATE both OU and OSU, you're gonna find yourself feeling left out from time to time. You think Native Americans deserved what they got? You're gonna have a hard time making friends. But really, it's the same as everywhere else: You have a bad attitude? You're gonna have bad time."
circumcision,"I have a case of phimosis which I can believe I can treat easily with stretching since I can already pull back about 70% of the way   Why even consider it then?   > However, I was thinking of getting a circumcision since I suppose sex might be painful as an uncut although I have no experience   I'm intact and experienced myself, sex will be better for both you and your partner (be it a man or a woman) if you keep your foreskin. I've never experienced painful penetration either.   > I don't want a girl to be feeling odd with me either   I honestly don't think you'd want to date a girl that shallow anyway. As long as you wash yourself properly I don't know why anyone would feel odd about you having a foreskin.

hockey,"As excited as I am about this, I'm upset, too, for having to say goodbye to the Coliseum. This was the arena that I grew up in, watching my team play in. I saw some of my all-time favorite players, skating on that ice...Jason Blake, Mike Peca, Bryan Berard, Eric Cairns, John Tavares....Alex Ovechkin, Donald Brashear, Evgeni Malkin, Milan Lucic, Mario Lemieux. I've seen some of the best games of my life played in that building, so many memories were made there. I hate leaving the Coliseum, I love the building, but it's been time for something new. I'll enjoy it until 2015, and once it's time to move to Brooklyn, I'll be right there on opening night. I'm just so happy they won't be leaving New York."

hockey,"I think the reason the double standard is there, is Datsyuk was pressed for comment and he seemed reluctant to answer.  When he did answer, it was one line.  Tim Thomas was using Facebook and the media as a soapbox insisting that his opinion be broadcast.   If Datsyuk didn't speak the party line, he would have been at odds with his church and government.  Not a good thing in that part of the world.   The stakes were much lower for Tim Thomas.  If he supports gay marriage, nothing happens.  If he speaks out against it, he gets shit on by people on the internet and he doesn't even know them.  His friends and family likely have the same views as him, and he lives in a country with free speech so it was an easy decision for him to speak his mind."

hockey,"DISSENTING OPINION, PLEASE DON'T DOWNVOTE JUST BECAUSE YOU DISAGREE   I just started the one week trial and am unimpressed. They only offer two bit rates (determines picture quality): 800kbps and 3200kbps. I live in an area where 3200kbps is just a tiny bit too much for my connection. 800kbps is only a tiny bit better than FirstRow/Wiziwig/atdhe streams which is laughably bad when viewed on my TV. GameCenter offers several options for bit rate and IMHO their video quality is better at any given bit rate. Now, I've only watched two games thus far, but both have had outages (satellite issues on HS's end) of 60 seconds or longer. When I expressed my dissatisfaction with both of these things on Twitter (without @mentioning hashtagging Hockeystreams), I got a snarky comment  from their account  about how they weren't having any issues on their end so it must be my problem. When I called them on their bullshit, they admitted they did have an outage but that they had quickly fixed the problem (the most recent outage had been several minutes long). They seemed more concerned with saving face on Twitter than actually helping a customer who was potentially going to spend over $100 annually on their service.   To be fair, this is a limited scope of experience, but when my week with them is up I will be signing up for GameCenter despite the fact that it is $40 more for the service itself and I use Unblock-us.com for an additional $5/month, effectively meaning I'm paying $190. At best, Hockeystreams is a service that isn't yet mature and is still in need of refinement in my opinion."
hockey,"I'm going to have to disagree, because I feel like you're making this judgement based on the beginning of this season. Historically, Lundqvist is not good in the month of October (or first month of the season). He's actually played pretty well in his last 3 starts, posting a shutout against an offensively strong Washington team (if you look at their roster). Plus, he was fighting a nagging injury that he suffered in game two of this season against the kings."
hockey,"I don't often go on this subreddit and I don't even know if anyone is still commenting on this thread, but for me it is Ovechkin.  I went through the whole thread and no one even mentioned him, except to compare franzen's back checking to his.  Maybe because I dont go on here often it's commonly accepted he's overrated, but I doubt that and I for see downvotes.   He's the most overrated to me because although he is an elite player and very, very exciting with probably the best shot in league I find that he is fairly one-dimensional, which is fine seeing as his job is to score, but I find he scores almost exclusively on the powerplay and/or against the tough (sarcasm) metropolitan division (one team with a winning record).  I just can't understand why the leagues best player (last years hart winner) is really the leagues best player when he can only score at an advantage (5v4) or against the worst teams in the league.  Shouldn't the best player be someone who does it in ever situation consistently?"
hockey,"Kessel was in the box for roughing.  Coincidental with Burrows.  They were cheaping each other out, no idea who started it, but clearly Burrows did something that pissed off Kessel, because suddenly he had his gloves half off, and was likely the one who challenged Burrows to fight.  Burrows drops his gloves, grabs Kessel and does a judo-esque throw that leaves them both on the ice.  The linesmen jump on them.  He's probably pretty choked at that point.   Clarkson then takes some fool roughing penalty a couple plays later while busily being ineffective and mostly annoying for 6.5M a year or whatever it is.  He sits down beside a steaming Kessel and says something dumb...and roll cameras.  Nice job by CBC's producer, or whomever's choosing the feed."

hockey,"A lot of guys are saying this should be a minor, not a major, but this is once of those instances where it has to be either no call or a major. Whether it is a minor or major is not based on the degree of contact from the offending player (which is what is being assumed in this thread), but rather it is based on the degree of impact Schenn has with the boards. Looking at how much contact Mack has with Schenn is the incorrect thing to base the penalty on, that is not how it is called in accordance to the rules. Since the ref decided it was a boarding penalty (which I think is debatable), and Schenn hit the boards really, really fucking hard and "violently" (rulebook term not mine) enough to appear injured, it must be a major penalty - it cannot be a minor."
hockey,"If you don't want to sit through me detailing why you're wrong, that's fine. Anyway:   I'm not really one to judge teenagers for listening to their helicopter parents, like I said above. I know he did the same thing with the Greyhounds, but it wasn't all that despicable. He was 16ish and wanted to stay close to home to finish his education while playing, which he did. (By the way, no one ever points out that the only reason the Greyhounds drafted him after he refused: Phil Esposito wanted to pretend they were keeping him so he could sell his share in the team for more money. Everyone paints them as some do-good underdog story.)   As for the Nordiques, Lindros didn't think the organization really wanted to win and, to be fair, around that time they were basically the early 90s equivalent of the Oilers. It's well-documented that he didn't like the team culture, didn't know their primary language at all, and (probably with his parents' influence) wanted a team with a better chance at marketing his star potential. For instance, he said he would have played for Montreal in a heartbeat, so that whole province hating him is nonsense. He was 18. People give him too much shit about it.   >He's canadian, he should know some French anyways.   To this day he knows five words, though he married a Quebecer and his father-in-law is a diehard, French-only Nordiques fan.   >In the end the Hounds won a Memorial Cup   And I'd say he did okay himself, since the year prior Oshawa won the Memorial Cup and Lindros won pretty much every individual award there was to win the year the Greyhounds won.   >the Avs did pretty well too   Yeah. The Avs. Turns out Lindros was right about the Nordiques. Their small market couldn't survive in the NHL. Their French-only radio stations, broadcast, and monolingual city hurt their English support. (By the way, Lindros wasn't the only player worried about playing in a francophone, small market area. He's just the biggest name and the only one youngsters remember.) Plus, hilariously, it took them moving the team to get that star-studded core to win, despite the organization's best efforts to fuck it up. They traded  Mats Sundin  (then a rising star, like Lindros) for Wendel Clark, with whom they had  another  falling out. And then they had to move him, too."
hockey,"Sorry if this hasn't been repeated a million times before but... the Oilers won the lottery and if they're not stupid will draft McDavid.  If he really doesn't want to play for them he will let it be known and MAYBE a team will trade for him.  If not, which is probable, he will be on oilers for at least a 3-4 year deal. If they still suck or just can't become a contender in that time... who's to stop him from signing somewhere else? It's not like he's stuck on the oilers for the rest of his career.  I wish him nothing but the best but it seems like everyone thinks he'll be an under performing oiler for life. Look at LeBron or any number of good athletes that can't get it done on their first team."
hockey,"It isn't people jumping to opportunity to explore some dormant racist instinct. 'Russians' aren't even a race as such.  Instead, it is people responding to recent changes in International playfield.  Russia has stopped being legitimate Nation among others and started being a legitimate threat to peace and stability in Eastern Europe. Nobody (except Russians,most of whom are utterly under Putin's spell) really likes that. People search outlets to express their dislike. Some scandal and nasty remarks about hockey sounds among most harmless ways to do it."
hockey,"The officiating is awful and inconsistent throughout every game, there's no denying that.   However, as much as a conspiracy as it sounds like, I have to believe that the Pens DO receive beneficial treatment. I'm not basing that on any stat; I'm basing it from games I've seen. Granted, I've only seen a few Penguins games/plays, and I'm basing most of my argument watching Rangers/Pens games, but the refs do appear to favor the Pens. Intentional or not, that's the way it looks to me. And before anyone says "Oh, just another Ranger fan with his blue shades on," I do have to say that the refs have favored the Pens more than any team I've seen.   Maybe the coaches and leaders on the team do a better job of talking to the refs. Maybe the refs really do have a "protect-the-stars" agenda (lots of talent on that team). Maybe there really is some kind of crazy conspiracy. Whatever the reason, the way it appears to me is that the Pens are favored in the penalty department in basically every game. I see the Pens get a bunch of PPs early in the game and take control. Then I see some "makeup calls" by the refs in late the third when the game is already over, thus skewing the stats to make it appear as if the Pens acquire a very similar amount of PIM as their opponents. I've seen some dirty plays by a Penguin go uncalled/unsuspended and ridiculous calls. I don't know; maybe I just hate the Penguins so much I really am blinded."
reddit.com,"Basically, a couple of the mods messed around with the site. At first, it wasn't bad, simply switching up votes and down votes, and putting a picture of a butt cake in the background.

reddit.com,"edited for clarity)   This is a good point, actually.   I usually don't discuss/debate faith and its merits with someone I don't know or have never met.  For instance, I don't jump into /r/atheism and start looking for a discussion.  I don't know anyone there, and they don't know me.  This sort of unfamiliarity nearly demands that whatever stereotypes or preconceived notions we may hold about "the other guys(tm)" will color our side of the discussion, regardless of which side is speaking.   If I  do  visit an atheist forum, certain things have to be assumed, though.  I have to assume beforehand that I will be considered less intelligent, less open minded, less of a whole individual than I might in a different forum.  It is expected, what with the preconceived notions and the bias I experience from the atheist/agnostic community regarding what is generally accepted knowledge of what a person of faith is or does or believes.  That's the voice of experience speaking.  I hate that's the case, but each and every personal online interaction I've had with people of non-faith has been precisely that.  In short, mostly assholes.   Guess what, though...  We Christians are represented by our worst elements as insufferable twits with no care for others, no care for science or its method, no grace, no critical thinking.  Because of the Christians I've seen acting online in the name of God, it often brings shame not only to what we're supposed to be, but (if you're a believer) who God claimed to be, and the ultimate story of grace we're SUPPOSED to be telling.  In short, we're assholes.   It is unfortunate, but it happens.  More disheartening, though, is those that profess to follow a man of peace, an expression of deity come to Earth are some of the most vile people I've ever met online.  It is a travesty and a shame that people of faith are so disingenuous and so insecure in what they think they believe they feel the only way to gain security is the demeaning of others.   Christians:  you don't know these people.  Whatever your particular version of a preacher told you isn't necessarily so.  In fact, I'll say it...  I find more friendships and close personal relationships based on trust and true love in the pagan community than I ever have in the Christian community.  Why?  They care about  who  you are first, and not what you particularly believe.  To make value and faith judgements on people you don't even know or to sequester yourself into some little sociological microcosm that feeds both your assertions and fears is highly unhealthy.  You should get out and meet people.  Have dinner with a gay couple.  Go to a ball game with some Pagans.  Explore all the richness of all that is around you.  Look for the good in everyone and be changed by the tapestry of beauty that is humankind.  If you really really believe that God created everything and everyone and did so for a purpose, you're selling yourself short to dismiss some because they don't have your particular brand of hand-stamp from "the club".  Instead of pontificating from a folding chair in your bedroom, interact with all kinds of people.   Being in technology, I am exposed to all sorts of faith, non-faith, differentiating viewpoints and world views through the people I work with.  If I discuss, say Buddhism with a coworker of mine (being a Christian), there is a relationship in place.  I know this person and they now me.  We both spend countless hours working together in a data center.  Whether racking/stacking, doing systems admin tasks together, going out to lunch on occasion, attending company functions...  We have "investment" in each others lives.   We may never agree one way or the other about faith or lack thereof, but my life is considerably richer for having known this guy/girl.  Hopefully, if queried, they would say the same.   Point is, the relationship is considerably more important to me than whether person "a" believes this or that and person "b" doesn't believe the other thing.   Would I like them to experience faith as I do?  Certainly, as I feel my life has become something it never would have; has become richer and more full than I might have experienced without it.  Out of my care and "love" for those around me, I want to not only share all that makes me who I am, I also want to experience the same about them.   Christians, if you really really want to be effective, learn to be affected."
reddit.com,"I agree, wholeheartedly.   I believe that Religion has run it's course.  Group think serves a human purpose.  It optimizes our thinking, allows us to build on the ideas and values of others.  Even without religion we will still have structured philosophies and popular atheism; and we will still have radicals and fanatics.  The assumption that getting rid of Religion will cure these problems patently false.   We shouldn't hatefully oppose Religiosity.  Intuitively, I suspect it accounts for a much greater portion of goodwill than most of us want to admit.  However, Religion limits people, as do all forms of blind faith.   It is important for us, as a society, to avoid discouraging rational thought.  Right now, this is happening most destructively with the interface of Religion and politics.  We also discourage rational thought in the techniques employed to pass (impose) Religion on to our children.  If people are better equipped to see through fallacies, the most problematic facets of religious extremes, and all manner of fanaticism, will be subdued."

The imgur link is just a bunch of stereotypes that have no basis in Christian belief, and in most cases is exactly the opposite of Christian belief. People see these stereotypes and immediately think that the belief system must be flawed based on the "followers," without using any real logic to make that assumption."

reddit.com,"well....sort of.  I get a lot of flac on reddit for putting words in people's mouths (especially on /r/atheism) but let me 'splain.   The attitude on /r/atheism isn't really "all religious people are fundamentalists" so much as it's just "religion is religion."  There are some ludicrous claims in both christianity and islam (the two most picked-on religions there) that  nobody  who claims to be christian can deny because if you do, then, well, you're not really christian.   For example, the Catholic church's official stance on gay marriage, abortion, and contraceptives is the same as that of any fundamentalist christian group.  Homosexuality is unnatural, abortion is the destruction of a human life, and contraceptives are unnatural.  This is the official stance of the catholic church.  however, loads of catholics i know feel the exact opposite.  they're the "open-minded" kind of christians that make comments like yours and Mintz08 who believe that you don't have to be crazy to be christian.  However, the church that you go to every sunday doesn't feel the same.  what does this mean?   well, it kind of means you're not really catholic, since you disagree with the church on some major issues.  It could almost be argued that you're not a christian because it's damn near impossible to believe in equal rights for gays, abortion, and safe sex,  and still call yourself a christian because the church you support and are a part of feels the opposite .   most catholics don't want to admit that though.  they want to say they're catholic, go to church, be a good person, raise their kids right, pray to jesus, and  still  support the idea that gays are people too, but zygotes aren't, which is incredibly anti-catholic.   i'll probably get downvoted for this post but seriously, the word "christian" has serious baggage and you can't just call yourself a christian and then cherry-pick which official christian doctrines you want to support.  /r/atheism is just obnoxious about the doctrines christianity does support (whether you know/like them or not)."
reddit.com,"I think we have a disconnect because I don't see "interpretation" having a whole lot to do with being a Christian. The Bible uses Jesus as its ultimate example of how a Christian should behave. Most Christians do not behave anything like that. That's not a matter of interpretation. Feeding the hungry, clothing the poor... all of that goes out the window with "most Christians." Many (most? likely) Christians are assholes, in complete opposition to how the Bible says they should behave."
reddit.com,"This  really  pisses me off like you can't believe. I'm always surprised at how bigoted people can be.   I'm Catholic. I "wasn't raised Catholic until I saw the truth." I don't "believe in a greater being, but not a god." I don't "believe in god but don't associate myself with a certain church." I'm Catholic. Flat out.   That doesn't mean I blindly believe everything I was taught. That doesn't mean that I stand by every single meticulous detail of the bible or preach about it. That doesn't mean I agree with all the teachings. If there's a priest out there who did wrong, that doesn't mean I agree with what he did.   I believe in God because I want to. Is there something wrong with wanting to believe in a greater good or in hope? I like to believe because it gives me hope that people aren't all bad. I like to be reassured that when I die, I won't just fall into a perpetual void. If I only ever end up under six feet of dirt, then so be it, but this is now and this is what I believe. I understand I can't see my beliefs and that they are not a tangible proven set of facts, but it's called faith.   I understand there's people out there who give religion a bad name. I hate what they do too. (The Westboro church. Don't even get me started on them.) I don't think it's fair to generalize everyone, just like I know it wouldn't be fair to say "all Atheists are condescending elitists." Some the most wonderful people I know are Atheists and I don't care. It's their choice. We have a mutual respect for each other as people based off who we are and who we know each other to be, not by what we believe.   Hell, If I want to believe in a prancing marker named Helga that lives in the ocean, makes it rain pokemon in Helsinki once a year, visits me when I'm feeling down, preaches about the future return of a once lost color, and who has squirrel apostle prophets, then let me believe. I don't see why you should make fun of me for that. (Okay, so maybe I do. I'd make fun of me for that, too. Still. 嗖燺嗖?You get my point.)   This also doesn't equate to me being stupid, uneducated, sheltered, closed-minded or what have you. The church is an idea. I put my faith in this, not a set of people. People are flawed. If we judge a set of ideas based off what people have done in the name of an idea, then I'm sure there are hardly any ideas worth believing in.   Hell, one of the things that pisses me off the most is hypocrisy, and I see it a lot where I go to church. That's not to say I'm innocent of this, and it's honestly not my place to judge them for it anyway. But hey, guess what? I don't go to church for them. I go to church for me. I go to church to try to be a better person. Let me have it. If you can be a better person without church, that's awesome.   I'm not the picture perfect Catholic. I'm excessively flawed myself, but I still like to think of myself as open-minded. I try not to hate on others, I only ask you do the same.   sigh  Well -that's about all I have to say about that."
reddit.com,"Listen, fucktard.   The practical difference between atheism and a religion is in the psychological manifestation thereof.   In a purely quantum universe, observation can never be obejctive. Therefore reality (at least from within the universe) can never be objective. And if you're taking into account various dualities in s-t geometry, even the objectiveness is variable based upon observer-state.   Therefore while atheism is absolutely the only religion that makes sense, it is not necessary for everyone to come to that same conclusion, and judging people for having a different opinion, is to me, no different than judging people for not liking chocolate ice cream.   Also, while yes, religions are completely bullshit, what's your point? I guarantee in 10 years the way we're going, some moron will say "WE MUST CLEANSE THIS LAND OF RELIGION! IT IS EVIL!", and the whole cycle starts again."
reddit.com,"So we should resist the grasp that religion holds on our societies by keeping our disagreement to ourselves?   There are ideas and people who have been elevated in the minds of others to positions considered immune to criticism, even excused from criticism altogether. "Behead those who insult Islam" is a catch phrase of one such example. You cannot reason with those that admit no criticism of their position. They are deaf to every word but their own.   The ridiculous is best answered with ridicule. Ridicule has the power to demote an idea from its untouchable throne because it is far harder to ignore than a coherent argument to a mind that defends on emotional rather than logical grounds.  And whilst ridicule may hold this power it can still be filled with accurate truths. Ridicule precedes reason because it has the power to open minds and ideas to further criticism. All ideas should be open to criticism otherwise there is no debate, no learning, no progress, and no hope.   It's no accident that comedy and satire cross boundaries politicians dare not. Satire holds the power to open minds to genuine debate on subjects that would otherwise be considered too sacred ever to question at all."
reddit.com,"The most logical argument I have, and the argument that has convinced me time and time again when my faith is shaken is as follows:   Evolution doesn't make sense to me.   Adaptation, I absolutely agree with. It happens, there is evidence of it. Cats become bigger and stripey in the jungle. Bears grow hollow hair that makes them warmer in arctic climates. It's facts. Granted these changes were extremely gradual, but the change WITHIN species is easy to agree with and you can hardly argue with it.   Evolution, or change OF species, I cannot agree with, and cannot fathom. Why would two fish in the same climate start along separate individual paths that lead one to be a mountain lion and one to be a wolf? Furthermore, as a singular animal, the mountain lion has HUGE "evolutionary" advantages. Wolves not only had to evolve from a fish to a dog through whatever path necessary, but also along the way had to pick up the pack mentality. Mountain lions hunt solitary. At the very least, when I try to think about how that time period played out, we shouldn't have wolves as the mountain lions should have used them as easy prey.   I realize this is HORRIBLY oversimplified, yes, but it lines up with the problem solving methods that have worked fantastically through my entire life. Occam's Razor states that the simplest solution is generally the best, so when I am trying to wrap my mind around a problem, I look at where it is now, try to imagine how the problem came to be, and then use all of that information to come up with a solution. It has served me extremely well in my studies in mechanical engineering and physics.   Granted this doesn't give me an answer, but it gives me a minimum of two possible solutions which I'm actually well-versed enough in to try to make a decision. I was brought up pseudo-Christian, so I had a base understanding of those tenets.   Where I took it from here is reading the bible cover to cover a few times and analyzing everything as in-depth as I'm capable of. I found things to be obviously out-of-date, but when you strip away some of the specifics that no longer make sense in society, and take the gospels to heart, it makes it much easier to get along with. Plus, the bible has within it some good moral guidelines. Granted all of this requires some measure of faith to begin with, and maybe some people would consider me ignorant for having any at all, but from there it's not a huge leap. The bible is like any other book that gets translated and has the telephone game played with it. Languages don't transfer perfectly, so you have to analyze it and make informed decisions on your own. Some may say that's a theological gamble, but from God's point of view, at least I'm making a damn good effort.   As far as why God puts us through "tests," I don't believe he does. Firstly because everybody has free will. Secondly, I can attest that these "tests" have made me an immeasurably stronger person. I recently went through some very challenging times in my life, and the way I kept my head up wasn't "this is a test, I'll be rewarded." It was "This is difficult, I am going to be a much stronger person able to deal with more of life's struggles after."   I'd also like to expand on something I briefly mentioned: The reason I try to be a good and just person. It isn't because some book tells me to. It's not because I'm afraid I'm going to burn forever if I'm not. It's because I consider myself a decent person. I'm not overly judgmental, I pay taxes, I look forward to someday having a family to raise, I help strangers when I can... In short, my goal is to leave this world a better place than I got it. When people see me doing this and ask why, I say "Because I'm a Christian," but not for the reason most think. I say it because the people I associate with in my Christian circles are like me. I want MORE people trying to make the world a better place. I'm not going to preach from a soapbox, but if somebody sees what I'm doing and thinks it's respectable, I will gladly answer questions about why, and introduce them to my peer group. (Note: I'm absolutely not saying people of other beliefs aren't also capable of this, it just works well for me personally because it gives me a banner to wave that I understand.)   However, sometimes in life, when you hit rock bottom, you need somebody to talk to. Personally, I have gone through all of my life alone. So when life piled up and I got depressed and lost motivation, and had nobody to talk to, I talked to God. And I'm not saying he answered in any tangible way, but even to mentally get that off my chest felt amazing.   I could just as easily have done all of this as an atheist, but when the time came to choose, I opted for the one with a simpler solution. The one where the only requirement was for me to believe in something intangible.   My question is this: Why NOT believe in God? You can make yourself believe anything if you want to. I realize Christians have had their reputation soiled over the years from things like the Crusades all the way up to that bastard Fred Phelps. But let's not lump everybody together. And science and religion are not mutually exclusive. I'm studying physics, for example. It all makes sense. From my perspective there just isn't a downside to believing in God. If I'm wrong, I lived my life trying to make the world a better place. If I'm right, I lived my life trying to make the world a better place. Either way I could be dead tomorrow or live another 100 years. The upside to believing is if I'm right I don't burn when I die, while there is no downside. That's not something I've actually thought of myself, though, because that's not why I do it. I honestly don't care what happens after death one way or the other, because it is completely out of my hands. I just know what I believe will happen."
reddit.com,"This is the tact I take when discussing politics or other contentious issues. Unfortunately, it doesn't really work. most people have invested so much of their own identity in to their own political beliefs that to attack the belief system (even in moderate, conciliatory tones) is for them to perceive an attack on themselves. Saying, "no, I do not think that Obama is a socialist. he holds almost no beliefs that can even be identified as socialism" somehow equates in their mind to my having belittled and attacked them. It's baffling."

reddit.com,"Yesterday at work I overheard two co-workers talking. One was telling the other about how her and her friend were thinking about going to Huntsville to counter-protest the execution to be carried out on 9-21-2011. They were going up to protest the executions protesters, I mean to say they were going pro-execution. I kind of scoffed at first and made a snide comment. My co-worker explained to me what it was the person had done. I was momentarily convinced by her explanation. So I momentarily conceded and went about my day. When I got home I fact checked her. So here is who this guy is and what he did from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's web site. (this guy is no longer on that link because he was executed yesterday)   Scheduled Execution     Link     Last Name     First Name     TDCJ Number     Date of Birth     Race     Date Received     County 09/21/2011     Offender Information     Brewer     Lawrence     999327     03/13/1967     W     09/23/1999     Brazos   Summary of incident Brewer was convicted in the murder of a black male occurring on 06/07/98. The offense involved Brewer and two co-defendants torturing and killing a 49-year old handicapped black male during the nighttime hours, in rural Jasper County, Texas. The victim was observed in the back of a pickup truck occupied by Brewer and his co-defendants. This was the last occasion the victim was seen alive by persons other than Brewer and his co-defendants. Brewer and his co-defendants drove to an isolated spot on a logging road where they beat and tormented the victim, then tied him to a logging chain, which was hooked to the pickup truck. Brewer and his co-defendants then dragged the victim to his death, leaving his decapitated and dismembered body to be found the following day by citizens and law enforcement officials. It was argued in court that Brewer and his co-defendants engaged in this criminal act, in part, due to their racially separatist affiliation with the Confederate Knights of America and the Ku Klux Klan. Brewer and one co-defendant were documented members of the Confederate Knights of America and a large number of Ku Klux Klan and other racial separatist organization paraphernalia was discovered in a residence occupied by the three. Co-defendants Berry, Shawn King, John Race and Gender of Victim Black male   So what the fuck? How can I say that this dude should live? I think my co-worker was right to feel the way she does in this instance. I understand the way the current system runs, isn't actually find the truth about guilt or innocence, it is to give the illusion of justice. You have alot of people being freed from imprisonment in the US because DNA evidence was used to prove they didn't commit the crime in question. I can't even imagine how small of a fraction of "in limbo" cases are actually being re-tried or having their cases re-examined, or even how small of a portion know what their rights even are and how to seek council (not like the law and rights are actually even taught to the majority of people in prison, I know I wasn't when I was taught it in school). I know this system is faulty and is completely capable of condemning innocent people. With that knowledge I understand that can not morally trust a system that could possible kill me and the ones I love, innocently. That is one of the biggest parts about the system that I hate, it is hugely flawed and I have to pay for it with my money, I digress. I can't trust a system that's able to and has in many many cases, killed innocent people. I don't trust them to pull the trigger on the "right" person, that's why I am against state sponsored executions. This fucker should die, this fucker deserves it, but what about Cameron Todd ( Texas killed him and he was innocent, I can't let that go. So it seems I agree with Tolkien, in this instance."

There's a huge difference in "export" vs. "internal" - if you'd reduce Germany to Cuckoo clock, Lederhosen and Nazis we'd not fare much better.     Yet, you raise an interesting point there: the trend towards refinement vs. mass compatibility: the latter is  your  characteristic social export (I'm avoiding 'cultural' here solely for the sake of my previous statement), refinement - in the sense of specialization from mass compatibility towards niches - appears to be the essence of what old Europe understands as culture."

reddit.com,"Not you, but the major studio and theire policy, yes.   Let's say, i own a little cinema-theater, and i wanna shoot a obscur movie for the sundance festival ( Well... if he reach sundance, it's not obscure anymore, but you get the point  ).   For shooting this great and not so well-know movie :  i will have some more work to do, and it will cost me money.  On the other hand, green-lantern and transformer 3 will come to me at almost no cost and without anything to do. ( in some case i will have to opt-out ! like spam )   In reaction to that, my country has made some law about movies importation, cinema production help, and a minimum ratio of forein / local movies. It's suck on the papers, but thanks to that we still have a movies industrie.   In conclusion, i hold responsible the flooding and very efficient marketing policy of the studio. Not a country, and even less the people in it.   On a side note.  This kind of policy are not alway bad. For exemple do you heard of digital cinema standard ( DCI ) ? It's a great and open standard. it's all 100 % in made the US, backed by the studio ( Disney, Fox, paramount ). And i will be used worldwide for a least 2 decades. It allow to shoot a movie in digital anywhere in the world, on any hardware, with the confidence that it will be correctely rendered.   Second and somewhat philosophical conclusion :   Big compagny are not bad for everything. But they tends to forget that culture is not a product.

reddit.com,"And the explosion of technology that brought the West from industrial to an informational society was centered here.

Maybe the US should be more like the OP's native Great Britain.

The fact is the US is the only non-imperialist superpower. Yes, it flirted with it for a while, and decided it was not interested. Those that claim the US wanted to "take over Iraq and Afghanistan" for their mineral and oil wealth can not make a solid argument. China has the most oil contracts that were auctioned off by the Iraqi government, and Afghanistan is basically a money and life sinkhole. There are much more attractive targets if the US wanted to be "imperialist".   The US took so long to defeat the soviets in the cold war because of one thing:  nuclear weapons . It does not take a rocket scientist to figure this out.   It is very popular to bash the US. Step back and take a look at what your country is contributing. If you are talking about the UK, you can't be a legitimate terrorist group without having a London presence.

An example of this is the idea of capitalism, which have no doubt came out of the idea for expansion of empires,  build -> invest ->profit  The same idea is used when applied to empires (this has a proper name but it has slipped my mind)  Conquer -> invest -> conquer more."
reddit.com,"Set the bar on rebellion? The American revolution only succeeded because of other countries. Without support from France, Spain, the Dutch and many first nations groups the revolution would have been a gigantic failure. France set the bar in revolution, their revolution was a success despite having nearly all their allies turn on them they still were able to overthrow the Royalists in France. Now that was a real revolution, they only had support from one foreign country(what little support that was) and was able to win their revolution even with Britain, Russia, USA, and other half of France attempting to stop them they still over threw the crown. As for WW2, you take far to much credit, the second world war was only lost because Hitler was an idiot and because the Russian's were able to win a war of attrition. If Russia had not been a factor in the war there is no way that the allies would have won, and even with the Russian's pushing back the German's(with some help from the allies obviously) Europe still nearly was taken even with your help. So really, if America is to be remembered as such a great nation why would all of it's accomplishments be dwarfed by that of other nations faced with even greater odds but still able to achieve the same result?"
reddit.com,"Another Australian here, not afraid to proclaim in earnest that the USA is the greatest country on earth. Flawed, as has been every superpower in history, but the core ideas of the US, its principles and Constitution are the most noble (and demonstrably successful) basis for a free democracy in human history. The vast majority of the American people are kind, generous and open and US society still stands as a beacon of hope for the success of a multicultural but united country. As mentioned, US culture is hugely influential and is perhaps the most exported culture of all time. Many will dismiss this as flag-waving rhetoric but I don't wave your flag; like many (often quiet) people around the world, I am inspired by the US and it's history.   Times might be tough now, economically and otherwise, but the core spirit of the American people will prevail."

reddit.com,"One word. Entrepreneur. These days job losses outpace job creation by such a huge margin, even if the economy gets better there will still be a job shortage. So get yourself hired by the one company that doesn't care about credentials - yours! Find a relative or friend in a low tax bracket (retired etc) in a state without ridiculous fees and create an LLC. Make a website, print your own business cards, get a DUNS number and a Federal Tax ID. Open a business checking account in a small local bank or credit union. Get you ass out there and sell, sell, sell. Your first 10 to 30K goes into the bank (owned by the business, your friend or relative) and they add this to their income, schedule C. Since they are hopefully on a fixed income it won't amount to much tax liability and they just "gift" you your money back tax free (cash, buy your stuff etc). You can always do their taxes for them twice, once with the business and once without and give them back the difference. You structure your web site and company identity to make you appear to be an employee, sales and IT pro. Throw in some doppelgangers to answer emails and collect invoices. Hire fellow students to help with jobs when need be (for cash). Mark up work by at least 100% with half up front to cover equipment and supplies as needed (no overhead is gospel). Approach small companies to do installation, on site service and training. Volunteer at old folks homes doing email, web cam classes. Use PayPal to accept credits cards, get a magnet sign for your card door. Look for niche businesses like video production companies and sell them custom PC/Mac configurations, build new suites for them, sell them on running there own web server, email, MySQL instead of the GoDaddy shared hosting they have now. Add this new position to your resume and maybe get in somewhere but maybe you'll like it on your own (though not for everybody - I think for more than they know it). Make your own hours, service folks they way they want it and you'll have a shot. You were in tech support so you know what you can do now that you're the boss, to make people happy. Offer something special, price it reasonable (please not to little either, you need to eat - I turned away/lost 14 clients in a row over about $700 in pricing each then landed a $20,000 gig - don't give up or give in). Learn about business, be honest to most and a used car salesman to some.  Use cheap Chinese coax, start with only what you have - you could start a whole business configuring and installing Faronics Deep Freeze for small businesses. How to use Facebook for businesses, wedding cake makers using meet-ups for cake tastings for brides to be (read a book and pass off that knowledge as your own). IT can be everything and you should expand your own comfort zone. I did this (not strictly IT but similar) five years ago after getting laid off from a 15 year career. Now I make more than I used to, I work 3-4 days a week, I've hired 4 other people and I still see growth. I have no debt, no overhead, work from home and I do what I love."
reddit.com,"Don't worry.  I heard that a few times before having a kid and it really isn't that hard to envision what life is like with one.  Many parents just become a bit irrational when doing anything related to kids.   Actually, scratch that.  There was one surprise I didn't expect.  You will find you spend way too much time talking about the consistency of poop that comes out of your child and other parents will openly talk about this stuff without flinching.  I did this with another couple just yesterday in the middle of lunch and nobody even blinked.  It's a little odd and I try not to share that part with non-parents since they may not have the stomach for it just yet."

The thugs in blue find any chance they can to use a taser and no damn well that it has a high chance of killing someone. That is why they use the taser when pepper spray would suffice.

In this case, we followed this child's story and sent him cards to bring him an early Christmas before he passed on. A lot of Redditors made this emotional connection through his story and sending of cards, and I think it is acceptable to allow ourselves extra grief for Noah's passing over the other 153,000 people who are going to die today."
reddit.com,"Can't upvote this enough. The MSF courses are affordable and completely invaluable since this is your first bike. Above all, always have your gear on. You'll get comfortable and cocky, but you're one shitty driver away from being a red smear on the asphalt without some padding and a helmet at the very least.   Another good point, START LOW. You have your whole life to work up to the 1200 CC engines. Unless you're exceptionally large, start with a smaller engine. A 250 CC engine is the first step up from a moped, and can easily get highway speeds. You'll also be averaging some insane MPG with that small of an engine. If you're too large to feel manly on a smaller bike, you can go around 500 CC for your first, but you  will  outgrow whatever bike you start on. And you'll likely drop your first bike at least once. If you aren't super muscular, getting that bike back up is going to be a pain in the ass if it's too large. I struggled for a good five minutes in traffic when my 800 fell over, then again, I'm not a large guy.   You can find a decent used 250 Ninja for ~$1500, only a year or two old. People outgrow them, so after their first years, the resell value stays high as it's a great starter bike. You can buy last year's model for $1750, sell it next year for $1750. Just take care of it, it'll take care of you.   Again, your gear is important, don't cheap out on it. I like [newenough]( for purchasing, it's a pretty good company."
reddit.com,"It was something I could do from far away. I didn't have any money so I did what I could. It was kind of a surreal experience.   I found out about 9/11 between classes in school. I went right to my next class and told her that I had heard about something in NY and I wanted to check it out. She let me go online and when I showed her what was going on we turned on the TV in class and I went to an online NYPD scanner feed. When the second plane hit, the whole class screamed multiple explicatives yet the teacher didn't even flinch.   At then end of that class there was an announcement that we should go to our next classes and not leave. I proceeded to walk right out to the parking lot, along with everybody else that had a car and license at that time.   I got home and checked out what was going on and decided that I wanted to do something. I really can't tell you exactly what led me to the idea of giving blood. I don't particularly remember it being announced but I could certainly be mistaken. I called my Dad, let him know what I was doing and headed off.   It was incredible when I arrived. We were directed to park over in another parking lot and then walk over to the blood bank. They also had their "Big Red Bus" out front. Some of the business around donated food and beverages so that was nice. Everybody was standing in line and every now and then we'd get news reports and stuff like that.   When it was finally my turn, I filled out some registration information and was directed to go outside and get one the "Bus". I walked in and sat down and as I was chatting with the nurse she noticed that I had written on my paperwork that I had my tongue pierced. She asked when I had it done and I told her that it was for my birthday in August. That was when she explained to me that I wouldn't be able to donate. I was obviously disappointed but I wasn't going to make a fuss. I came home and glued my eyeballs back to the tv."
reddit.com,"I'm not so sure about this one.  They state that he was talking about going out to shoot illegal firearms.  Oregon is pretty liberal with their gun laws (even more so that Washington State where I live).  Provided you have the proper documentation and permits (from the BATFE) it is perfectly legal to own and operate a machine-gun in Oregon (as well as suppressors, SBRs and AOEs but I'm not sure about DDs).  As an avid shooter, I know that there are people who are generally uncomfortable around guns, or even discussing them.  I could understand their unwillingness to confront somebody directly about such an issue (especially when that person has a concealed carry permit [as the article alludes to] and carries).  I think going to a trusted figure who was in some way responsible for the setting they were made uncomfortable in (the party).  What I cannot understand is that the professor would actually think that a public naming and shaming was the appropriate way to go about this.  Especially ending it with a threat of harassment.  This is of course, predicated upon the student having not actually threatened anybody or group.  The proper way to have handled this would have been to speak with the individual privately and inform them that what they are doing is making others uncomfortable and disrupting the learning process."
reddit.com,"I think it would help but it will never happen because there is a profit motive. Alcohol offenses have become a surefire and safe way to generate revenue for local government. The more people are responsible about driving drunk the less revenue the community makes and the lower the legal blood alcohol will go.   The less offenders there are the less money MADD will generate. They all ready know this and are turning the focus towards making it illegal to drink on trains. Maybe planes next?   If the community builds public transportation they get double-whammied. Once with the cost of the public transportation. Again with lost revenue from fewer offenders.   And keep in mind you can also be arrested for riding a bike while intoxicated. You can be arrested for walking home intoxicated. The system is set up for profit, not to actually address the problem.   That said -- Please don't drive drunk."
reddit.com,"Man, I've been loving this particular strawman for over a decade now.  Thanks for breaking out the classics.   The reality is that Reddit is a business.  The owners get paid because the users keep coming back to the site.  Having users bitch and moan is not a problem for the admins - this isn't their personal blog, they're not mopy teenagers who are gonna cut themselves when they see how mean people are being to them on the interwebs.   The problem for the admins is when users stop visiting Reddit altogether because of constant technical problems, or fishy administrative decisions about deleting threads, or too many spammers, or etc.  They would much rather have us bitch about these things on the front page, create giant threads about them that keep thousands of posters and tens of thousands of readers engaged and on the site, and provide catharsis and a public forum to address the issues."

reddit.com,"I grew up in the middle of nowhere in Texas. My husband (then boyfriend) was driving down the service road of the interstate in a low spot where the interstate is up on bridges and the deer cross there regularly since they don't have to fight traffic. The service road we were on however is not raised. Out of the corner of my eye I see a herd of deer running straight at the service road. Not pondering homonyms at the time i say "Deer."   He looks at me, "Yeah?"   There was only a split second of confusion because then they were in front of us. We were ok, but they smashed in the whole front end of the mazda b2200 that we were in. The fan was in the radiator. We call my dad to bring the jeep and tow us back to the house. While we're waiting on him to make the ten minute drive to where we are, a cop rolls past us, stops and parks on the side of the road twenty or thirty feet up. He walks back and asks us what happened so we told him. His first question?   "Did you kill any?"   We were more interested in the damage to the truck and making sure we were ok. The snarky nineteen year-old i was and being slightly freaked out at the time, my immediate response was "Do you see any?"   It got better after that and after confirming someone was on their way, he left. Sad part is, when we were hooking the vehicles together we realized he'd walked right past a dead deer on his way to question us.   So i think obvious and/or unnecessary is part of serving. It's like after dinner mints with no dinner."

Because they lack the man power, and don't have any reasonable leads.

reddit.com,"I grew up in a fairly wealthy US suburb and had nothing but good experiences with cops while living there.  They really seemed to be there to help the community, and everyone that I knew had a good relationship with them.  The few times I was busted for silly things (breaking into a locked mausoleum as a teenager, surprised by cops with flashlights peering into my car window while ineptly making out with someone), they always were kind, somewhat bemused, just friendly on the whole.   I went to school in Oklahoma though, and once there had nothing but awful experiences with the cops.  It was such a shock to give a friendly greeting to the police and be treated with outright suspicion and hostility.  Had some bad times there, including a brief detention and questioning for some silly stuff that the cops wouldn't have batted an eyelid at back where I grew up.   I also had some bad experiences with police in the Czech Republic back in the mid-90's - just corruption essentially, making us foreign teenagers pay them off with all the cash in our pockets, threatening to throw us in jail for nonsensical stuff.   Oh - was recently in Cambodia, and the level of police corruption in Phnom Penh is so high that it's kind of humorous.  It's so blatant that I don't even know if it qualifies as corruption anymore, it's just crazy stuff.  Police stand on corners with a hand outstretched and as people pass by on their motorcycles they literally hand money to the cops as they pass them - it's that blatant.  If you don't give them money, they pull you over and ticket you for some nonsensical offense.  In some ways that's obviously terrible, but as a foreigner with a lot of money (relatively speaking), it's kind of a nice feeling to be somewhere where you know you can solve any problem, no matter how bad, with some cash given to the right person.  Actually, it's probably the same feeling as being incredibly wealthy somewhere else.  Have the right amount of cash, you can always make problems disappear."

In Argentina nobody does that, respect the law and allow people to cross the street is the crazy behavior you are taught in school and that people follow in other countries that just by chance also have much better quality of life; but I disgres.   The car behind mine bumped into mine. I look thought the mirror and I do an open-hands-sign like, "What's going on?". It was really minor, I didn't care for a fight or the scratch on my car. I continue driving and about half a block the car overtakes me very fast, crosses in front of mine and stops. It was like a movie, really.   The guy steps out and totally freaks, shouting me to step outside the car. No way I'm doing that. When he saw that it wasn't going to be easy to get me into a fight he decided to punch me right through the (open) window of my car. He didn't expect me to have a pepper-spray, which I used on his face.   He was totally blind but still fighting. I put the car in reverse to try to flee the crazy bastard when I see two guys running towards me. They were cops, that were on guard on front of a police station. The whole thing happened in front of a police station. My thought was "How lucky I am, all this was witnessed by law enforcement so I don't have to convince anybody I was attacked, they know it, and they are now bringing order and I don't have to pull a crazy flee or more fight".   On that day, after trusting the police for 19 years, I've lost my faith. The one time I needed them and were present (not like the previous three time I was robbed before) they turned against me. I was questioned and held on a cell for the night. I was lied. Honestly, it wasn't bad, I wasn't beat, I wasn't humiliated excessively or anything; mainly because I kept my cool and was friendly towards the police.   I was friendly when they've told me the guy filed a complaint because I attacked him. I was friendly when they've told me that my car was to be impounded unless they've found a parking spot for it (which thankfully, we've found), I was friendly when they've told me that I couldn't fill a complaint back to the guy which was a lie[1], I was friendly when they've picked my possessions, including my wallet and found out I was carrying a ton of money because I was going to buy computer parts, I was friendly when they took my shoe laces, I was friendly when the other guy, the crazy bastard just went home almost like if nothing happened[2], I was friendly when they've told me I couldn't see my parents when they've came to pick me up, I was friendly when they've told me that all was clear and I could go home once the medic cleared me up, and the medic took 8 hours to show up."

Good car/bad hood...Ever watch COPS? Have a little common sense. That's the #1 way to pick up rich white guys buying drugs. Illegally searched, false ticket? So you whine to us but don't bother to actually do anything about losing your constitutional rights? Heard of a lawyer? they can help you. Apartment robbed and no prints taken? No shit, this is the real world, not CSI. That's routine. Even if they took prints to make you feel better, odds are that it would have done nothing to get your stuff back. Calling pawn shops is actually the first thing you should have done. Again, common sense.  Cop didn't show up for trial because he was just too fucking lazy? Did you have a copy of his schedule that day? Pics or it didn't happen. Police unions are run by cops and I agree they protect the bad more than help the good. It's a union, what do you expect? It's  unfortunate but true. and agreed that many cops do have the better than us attitude. I don't know why and sure wish it weren't so. It wasn't that way years ago.

reddit.com,"My worst experience, but not the only: In my bed with my GF, my son (12) was playing video games in the Front Den. It was summer time, and he had the front door open, screen door was shut and locked. It was about 10:30 , and I was not going to bed, just watching TV with her in bed. (Only other tv in the house) I hear my son yell Dad, dad, dad, dad over and over. Instinctively I scurried from the bedroom to be met by 2 cops coming down the hallway. (I really hate to think what would have happened if I grabbed my pistol first)   My son is totally terrified. I ask them what the F()[k they are doing? They ask me where my son is. I tell them he is right behind them. One officer turns and walks down the hallway, as my GF comes out of the bedroom. He ask again where is her son. She says Johns son is right behind you. He said OK where is Marty. I then get pissed off, and ask how they came in, The said the door was open and they walked in. The light goes on in my mind, I tell them Marty does not live here, now get the f()[k out.  I tell them GTFO or I will shoot both of you. Bad move, I wind up being pushed against the wall. with my arm pushed up behind me. My GF starts really freaking out, and starts talking to them.   She explains that Marty is my step son and moved out 2 years earlier when I got divorced. Meanwhile They refuse to leave and the other one start looking around (through my kitchen, dining room, bedrooms). When the partner returned, the officer then released his grip on me. They asked the usual follow up question like where is he now etc... I interfered with her answering and asked why they needed to find him, They said "We got a call from a girls mother, she does not want her hanging out with him" WTF? Now I am really pissed off, and ask when they became babysitters?  I then asked how old was the girl? They said they did not know but probably 17. Marty would have been 17 or 18 at the time. So I told them I have no idea, and again told them to leave. (albeit not very nicely) As they were leaving I notice the screen door catch is broken and the door is not latched, And I went off on that. They laughed and said it must have been that way. Calls and visits to the chief/DA/ Mayor yielded nothing, no apology, no investigation. nothing. My Gf said if she was not there, she would never believe my story and that I was an ass and/or suicidal telling a cop I was going to shoot them."
reddit.com,"I just want to get this one out there. I live in a mid-sized city in NYS. I was at a going-away party for a friend this past weekend in a part of the city that is a mix of 20 somethings and families. There were around 40 people in attendance, with some on the front porch and many in the house. We had music at a fairly high level inside the house and had the front door open with the screen door closed. It was 11:30. Everyone at this function was over the drinking age. A noise complaint was called in from a neighbor a few houses away.   Four cop cars pull up in front of the house. They exit their vehicles and the lead officer blows into the house without permission demanding that everyone exit the house now and have their ID's ready. They ID every single person and then announce that this party is over and everyone is leaving now. The officers then begin harassing people that are milling about wondering how the fuck this is actually going down and they yelled at them to get into their vehicles and leave. Most people comply. I stayed because I was aware that this was bullshit, but of course was not about to call these pumped up officers on their shit and make it worse for me (not my house). It was announced to us that their was a "zero tolerance policy" on this particular street because they had problems with a few houses around there (which may explain why they responded to a noise complaint with four cops and a shut-this-shit-down attitude). They also issued the owner of the house (my friend who's moving to South Carolina) a noise violation ticket, as a little cherry on top. So I've had a few negative interactions with officers of the law but this one was recent and of a particularly ridiculous nature."
reddit.com,"I went to court over a speeding ticket.  You actually have to go twice since the first time is BS.  A clerk and a cop from the force the ticketing officer is from (not the actual officer) look at the ticket, go "looks reasonable to me," and you pay a court fee to appeal and have your real court hearing.   I had been pulled over on a road with many stoplights, during afternoon rush hour, without being clocked, without being caught on radar, by a cop who was in an adjacent lane that happened to be going slower.   Zero evidence of speeding.  Officer claims I was doing 55 in a 30.  Judge states they don't believe the officer since going that fast through that area seems pretty hard to do to the judge (actually happened right out in front of the court house).  Judge closes with, "I don't think you were going 55 but you were probably still speeding."  Ticket is reduced to min ($100 but I care more about insurance going up) and I had to miss two days of work."
reddit.com,"Wow, I've never hear of a park ranger behaving that way.  In my experience they're the most laid back and stoney law enforcement there is.  BTW, pushing back until they call "backup" is a great go to move (IMHO).  This happened once to me after I forced my friend to pull over so we could pee.  Cop then pulls up and is immediately up in our grill.  I'm completely wasted (hence the demand for a pee break), but my friend driving is fine.  They could have had me on an "indecent exposure" charge but instead they had to call back up.  So then, Grizzly McBeenacopforyears pulls up, asses the situation, gives my friend a half-assed sobriety test (which he passes, of course) tells cop 1 to fuck-off and we go on our marry."
reddit.com,"Im from the UK, and I totally agree with the above. I left town one night after a night out, was a little tipsy so walked most of the way because I wanted to sober up before getting home. A police van pulled in beside me, 4 guys got out, shoved me against the wall and strapped some cuff's on me. I shrugged them off, turned around and in the nicest plain voice asked "What am I getting arrested for?" Im 5'11, big build. They stood around me against the wall and just answered "suspected criminal damage" they rounded me up and shoved me into a regular police car that just turned up, doing a good job of attempting to break my wrist. Now, I had sobered up pretty good by now. A policemen marched me through the station, deemed me too drunk to take questions and shoved me into a cell for the night. The next day I was told to 'confess' and just get a slapped wrist and a warning, oh, and asked if I want a solicitor (lawyer). I blatantly said no, I have nothing to hide and haven't done anything wrong. I denied all charges and asked why it was me who was brutally arrested for no apparent reason... the answer? I wore a white shirt, dark blue jeans and had dark hair... and within 45 mins of the scene of the crime. 45 mins! it takes that long to cross the length of town, it could have been anybody. So, I was picked as a scapegoat. I wasn't identified but it scared the hell out of me, thinking I may get pinned for a crime I had not committed, potentially ruining future prospects.   I later found out the crime was a small patio window had been kicked in, would have cost the owner 拢40 to fix? I'd probably have just paid that so there wasn't any more stress from the ordeal, I was only in my teens at the time.   I had to get a solicitor involved during the image capture (ID parade) they sent me a letter to let me know the charges had been dropped as I wasn't identified. I was worried sick at the time, and didn't even get a phone call from them to let me know what had happened. This whole process took months.   The pickup by the parents the next day was heartbreaking, they presumed I had done wrong but soon changed their tone when I explained.   wrists ached for a good 3 weeks after that, typing was a bit of a nightmare and I was currently on a university course applying for educational based jobs."
reddit.com,"You only hear the bad stories.  I was trying to prove that the other side exists.  And for the ridiculously high number of interactions with people that police have every minute of every hour of every day, the number provided here or from any other stories are small relative.   Yes, there are bad people in every job everywhere.  But I have seen in person, and seen through stories where the truth comes out later (from the original or through proven source such as video/etc) that oftentimes, "bad police" are usually caused by "bad people"..."
reddit.com,"It seems everyone's experience is relative.   I was walking home one day, very drunk after a party at a friends house. I live in a rough neighborhood by the University of Cincinnati, and I saw a police officer who had pulled someone over. Mind you this is at 230 in the morning, so trying to feel safe I cross the street to over where the officer was. I was carrying an  Arnold Palmer . The officer sees me, and calls me over. Suddenly I panic, thinking he thinks I'm drunk and that I'm going to be cited for jaywalking and public intoxication. He asks me what I have in my hand and I quickly rabble off "Arizona iced tea arnold palmer!", which in hindsight is a very drunken slur sentence. The officer shines is flashlight (torch in your parts) on the can and laughs, says he thought it was a beer and asks me how it is. I say great, and he simply walks away. I was over come with gratitude, he didn't harass me as I thought he was going to, and he was very courteous and professional. Now I know this isn't everyone's experience, but sometimes the police can be really nice.   Although, it seems cops really, really hate skaters. As I skate, sometimes the police roll up and immediately tell us to leave even if we aren't grinding on anything or damaging property.   Come to think of it, there was another experience at a fraternity party, where the police showed up (not campus pd, but cincinnati police), and broke the party up. I was waiting for my friends and I was watching a cop talk to some guy. A drunken frat boy walks up to the kid and belligerently says "I'M A CRIMINAL JUSTICE MAJOR, DON'T TALK TO THE PIGS". The cop turns around and says "sir, you need to step off before I cite you for public intoxication". A warning. The kid got a fucking warning after he insulted him so openly."
reddit.com,"I believe it's a mistake to think that American cops are completely homogeneous in culture and attitude. Each state has its own laws and customs on how to run the police force. Then, each city has its own police organization run with varying effectiveness.   Undoubtedly you will get varying quality of officers across the nation. From where I live in Austin, almost nobody has any problems with cops. All my friends that have been arrested fucking  deserved it because they were clearly and blatantly disregarding the law . It's either public intoxication, where they're so fucking drunk they're puking everywhere (but even in those situations arrests are extremely unlikely; on my friends 21st b-day he was drunk and puking all over me; the cops found him and decided to call an ambulance for him, no charges) or they were driving while intoxicated, which in that case they should be arrested.   All of my interactions with cops in Austin have been fair. Minor traffic infringements. Rarely cops will go around busting parties but they're always too lazy to arrest anyone. Lately they just walk about and make sure the party's not getting out of hand.   The latest incident with police was at a critical mass event where this fucking asshole driver hits a cyclist  on purpose . The angry cycling mob of course then begins to start beating the shit out of the guy's car using their u-locks. The driver pulls out a gun I guess to threaten the cyclists, but luckily a cop soon comes and arrests him.   From my limited knowledge of local government, it is we the citizens who control the police department; their corruption is a result of our own idleness and laziness to solve local governing problems. I'm glad I live in a well maintained and governed city that has responsible law enforcement."
reddit.com,"My neighbors called animal control because my dogs got out.  They have gotten out before and I explained that if they can't get in touch with me to call and get them picked up.  i don't want them to scare people or get hit by a car.  However, animal control was busy and a police officer was dispatched.   When the officer arrived my black dog was sleeping on the porch, ran into the yard and barked at the cop car.  The officer waited a few minutes and Vegas went back to the porch and laid down.  The officer got out of his car and walked across my front yard (do do what?).  Vegas got up again and ran into the yard barking.  The officer drew his weapon and fired one shot.  It hit her on the left side of the chest and exited out her left shoulder.  She then ran back to the porch and bled for approximately 15 minutes until animal control arrived and put her in the vehicle.  I arrived 5 minutes after that to find 4 cop cars out front. On officer calmly explained what happened and that he believed my dog was fine.  Gave me a case number and a CLAIM NUMBER because the ricochet bullet blew out my glass door in front of my house...   I asked if i was free to take her to the vet and he said yes.  I walked over to the truck, pulled out my dog and carried her to my truck and placed her in the cab and left for the 24 hour vet.  The vet thought she would be fine but needed to clean her, take some x-rays and stich her up.  Apparently the bullet hit her scapula and that's how it ricocheted.  $1200 and 20 hours later she was at home and fine.  After 2 months she didn't even have a limp."

Sure, I heard some stories of racist cops, but I felt that Toronto cops were an honourable force. Until one day I watched my innocent friend getting pinned to the ground, taking blows from at least 3 officers to his body and the side of his head. I tried running up to help him and explain the situation but they pushed me away pretty much telling me it's too late, he's arrested. I watched him getting pulverized without any explanation even though he wasn't resisting at all. I waited until dawn for him to come out and he still wasn't out. The next morning, he had bruises all over his face and the cops took a couple gut shots before putting him in his cell.   What happened was my friend was standing on the side of the road beside the curb as the sidewalk was too crowded after club hours. We were talking about what a great night it was and then suddenly, a police officer on a bike happens to nudge him and falls on his bike. The next thing I see is 3 officers pin him down and gets charged with assault. I felt so helpless, I really wish it occurred me to record the incident. This situation has really affected my friend's social life and it really sucks that he doesn't want to hang out as much anymore because he was the type of guy that would be the life of a party and really took the time to get to know everyone. I still remember in HS freshmen year he introduced himself out of the blue on the first day assembly and we just hit it off. He's trying to fight the charge but it doesn't look too good for him. I know that the story isn't as bad as countless other things police have done but it's because of this, I feel as though I can never trust a cop again. Until the police are willing to take initiative action for such internal corruption, I will never ever trust an officer again. It doesn't matter if you're a good cop, do the honourable thing and report corruption. If you turn the other eye, you're just as corrupt in my opinion   **["
reddit.com,"Interestingly, there is some research that seems to link childhood exposure to lead with an increased adult tendency to commit violent crime.   There seems to be strong correlation between the enaction of environmental laws to limit childrens exposure to lead and a drop in violent crime (including murder) 15 to 20 years later.   Variations have even been seen on local and regional levels - from increased instances of violence committed by those who grew up close to high-traffic highways in the 1960s (continuous exposure to exhaust from leaded gasoline), to a sharp drop in NYC violent crime 20 years after mandating a change in windows that sharply decreased children's exposure to lead.   From what I've read, the statistics show a sharp correlation on local, regional and national levels.   Anyway, I agree with you on the whole - solving crimes, helping the community, these are all things that police (at least the ones that I've mostly been fortunate to deal with) do, and at least sometimes do very well.

As I walked toward my car, another guy from the building came running toward me.  He was being threatened by an angry customer and his overly-aggressive son and wanted a witness.

The son was pretty big and obviously trying to intimidate the guy (balled fists, scowling, standing too close, rocking back and forth).  The father and son followed the other guy over to where I was parked and kept harassing him.  I put the massager in the car and tried to talk them down, but they refused to let him leave.  I told him to call the cops and waited for them to arrive so I would know he was safe.  The son told the cops that I had threatened him with some sort of exotic weapon.

I decide to pass on his offer and buy my own modem.  I plug it in and it doesn't work.  Call again and tell them I bought a new modem, they tinker around and get it to work.  Then I plug in my old one for shits and giggles and low and behold, it also works!

reddit.com,"Back in the day when my kids were young, we were a struggling, one income family because we decided it was better to have a mom at home, rather than more money. So, we didn't even use wic, even though we qualified, because we felt there were those who needed it more than we did.   And then I would stand in line behind someone on food stamps, and watch them put racks of ribs, steaks, fresh vegies and lots of junk food on the belt, while I was standing there looking at my ground beef and canned food, because it was what I could afford.   Sometimes having principles sucks.   I have believed for a long time that food stamps should be like wic. You should only be able to buy food that has to be prepared. No high sugar, pre-packaged crap. Just set it so the card kicks them to the side, like it does non-food items, or alcohol and tobacco and it wouldn't be abused nearly as bad.   Back in the day my niece asked me to drive her to the food stamp office. I told her money was short, but if she could even give me 2 or 3 bucks, that would make it possible. She assured me she would be able to give me gas money. Turns out she wanted me to drive her to a friend's house so she could sell some of the food stamps for cash to pay me. Needless to say I didn't take her to her friend's house, didn't get any money for the effort, and didn't drive her anywhere again."

Always tell your doctor if you've noticed a change in one of your breasts, especially if your mammogram is interpreted as normal.   Mammograms in younger women can be difficult to interpret. The breasts of younger women contain more glands and ligaments than do those of older women, resulting in dense breast tissue that can obscure signs of cancer. With age, breast tissue becomes fattier and has fewer glands, making it easier to detect changes on mammograms.   Having a mammogram may lead to additional testing. Among women of all ages, about 10 percent of mammograms require additional testing. However, most abnormal findings aren't cancer. If you're told that your mammogram is abnormal, make sure that the radiologist has compared your current mammogram with any previous mammograms.   Screening mammography can't detect all cancers.

reddit.com,"It is simple. Why did you become rich? Because you were great at something and made a benefit of it? Partly, perhaps, but the real reason is that people let you. Would you have become rich in North Korea? Or in Somalia? Or in Soviet Union? Most likely not. The people allowed you to become rich.   We westerners have this weird idea that equality and democracy and freedom are the basic state of humanity, but it is not. Anarchy is. The survival of the fittest and the most brutal. Now, we have seen what happens when a society falls under anarchy: violence. Would you be rich in anarchy? No, you would most likely be dead!   So, to protect ourselves from anarchy, we make a social contract known as society. There are and have been many different kind of contracts, aka societies, with different rules and rights. The major thing in them has been that they have to be supported by the majority of the members, or they will fall and be replaced with new social contract. Sometimes they have used lies to maintain support (power of the nobility comes from god for example), sometimes fear (evil socialist threaten our german reich), but generally the modern western society is based on one ideal: power in the society belongs to the people.   This gets us back to the beginning. Why did you become rich? Because of the social contract that made it possible and allowed it. There is no reason why the majority should support such a contract as it does not benefit them, with the minor exception of believing "maybe I can do that too!", and when they realize that such thoughts are highly unlikely, they will end the contract.   Now, if the rich would pay more taxes with larger percentage, it would benefit everyone in the social contract. It would benefit the rich for still being able to get rich (and not get shot in some revolution that will come with the current system), and it would benefit all other members of the contract aswell as they would get more taxmoney for their benefit. Now you can say "but don't they already benefit with us paying the percentage, as we still pay more in numbers for having larger pays?" Well, if we go with the same percentage, the majority would benefit much more if they would get that money instead of you, because the amount of taxes would be the same regardless of who earns the money. With progressive taxation it is beneficial for them as a whole, as the amount of taxes the society gains are higher in mere numbers, so there is a reason to allow people become wealthier."
reddit.com,"Have you considered auditing?

I started school as a Corporate Finance & Accounting major, but realized that straight Accounting, and more specifically auditing, was the way to go.  As long as corporations exist, there will always be a demand for auditors - especially if clients continue to lure them away for their own finance/accounting departments after 3-5 years (huge monetary gain).   Some other perks:     Upward mobility is extremely structured (almost guaranteed promotion in 2-3 years and $10,000-$25,000 raise).     If you don't want to be couped up in a cubicle all day, ~70% of your time is spent at clients' offices with a good chance of international travel in the bigger firms.

It's an issue of [negative rights vs positive rights]( and is not limited to healthcare.   A negative right is one that obliges the inaction of another. For example the right to free speech means another can not stop you from expressing yourself.   A positive right by contrast obliges the action of another. In this case healthcare. A right to healthcare means that someone else is obliged to provide you with a service.   Libertarians of which rand is one (more or less) are fans of negative rights, but obliging one person to do something for another against their will, no matter how noble the goal, violates the right of that person to choose how use their labor."
reddit.com,"Insofar as this is what Ryan says, he is simply wrong.   There is no "slavery" here; there is only taxation.  Taxing the general public to provide a service is not slavery.  Slavery occurs when one or a few are conscripted to provide labor for others.  Taxation shares the burden among everyone, and we use tax revenues to provide services that are available for all.  You may have enough wealth to afford private education or to not need food stamps, but they are available for you if you do need them.   There is a simple question here, and it is entirely obscured by Ryan's ideological, pseudo-academic line-drawing:  What services are important enough to provide to the general public?  That is a policy decision, and one we can answer with the democratic process.  It is a question entirely unsuited for ideological black-and-white answers.  There are no  a priori  principles that say whether a service is important; there is only what we decide together as a society.   Finally, to make my point clearer, there is no meaningful difference between negative and positive rights.  All "rights" imply duties--duties to refrain from doing something or to do something.  But there are no absolute rights.  All rights are exercises in accommodation.  A "negative" right, in your example, says that I cannot stop you from expressing yourself.  But I can!  For the good of society in general, I can stop you from burning crosses in an effort to intimidate others or from yelling fire in the proverbial crowded theater.  Moreover, your "negative" right says that I  cannot  do something, which is no less restrictive than a positive duty to do something.  We accept many positive duties much more readily than negative duties.  There is nothing worse about the duty simply because it is "positive."  (E.g., compare the way we feel about rules requiring us to purchase car insurance, which has a net social benefit, with the way we feel about rules preventing us from shutting up the Westboro Baptists.)  Now I think I've said what I came to say, so I'll stop."

But some people say  fashion  is the art of keeping up with the trends, of making sure to spend a bazillion hours a week researching blogs and websites, and running yourself ragged making sure to always have the latest stuff.  On the other hand,  style  might be defined as the art of expressing one's personality through clothing choices, something that might not change as much from one decade to the next.  So while fashion magazines and websites might be important if you're in your teens and twenties and are interested in wearing the latest neon colors, books become more important for those old enough to realize neon is not very flattering on 99% of those with European skin coloring.  Here are a few things I've learned from books:   1.) How do I dress for my particular shape?  (How can I minimize a large bust / enhance a small bust?  Make my legs look longer?  Appear taller?)  Waistlines go up and down with trends, for example but if you know what looks good on you (say, empire waists), you'll purchase several items in empire waists in classic, solid colors while they're on trend to make it through the drought when they're not.  Good tailoring for your body in particular is part of this; tailoring seems to be discussed a great deal more in books than in magazines and websites.  Choosing colors best for your skintone also might be something books can help with.   2.) What materials are best for me?  If you're still in your teens and twenties, you might still purchasing the polyester junk from Forever 21 and H&M.  But as you age, you begin to appreciate the comfort and breathability of real cotton, silk, and wool.  Polyester has indeed improved since the '70's, but it still doesn't float like real silk, nor will it keep you both warm and cool like wool, which wicks away sweat amazingly well.  Books can be great for emphasizing real quality in materials and stitchery; magazines tend to focus more on who designed something instead of the seamstress who sewed it up.  (Yes, good designers tend to use good quality materials on average, but some start out with a famous name brand, and then start making crap.  I looked at a whole bunch of Calvin Klein suits recently at Macy's.... they were all polyester!)   3.) A little black dress has been popular since Audrey Hepburn.  Burberry gave us the trench coat.  A striped tee has been popular since Coco Chanel.  Brands like Old Navy and Ralph Lauren have built their entire lines around the nautical feel Chanel gave us!  As Urthwhyte says, it's great to know a little about history so you can know what pieces are classic and spend real money on something that will never go out of style.  And yes, that does indeed change!  Charmian Carr (Liesl) was encouraged to spend her earnings from The Sound of Music on a fabulous fur coat, which would "never go out of style."  And then animal rights activists started pouring things on and throwing things at people who wore them, and things changed.  But in general, there are some things that have stayed the same, and it's nice to know how to pick out a good pair of classic black pants that I can wear with that blouse that simply doesn't go with anything else."
femalefashionadvice,"It depends on how much time you'll be spending outdoors. I went to NYC the first week of December a few years ago for the first time (I live in Texas). I was woefully unprepared. I had this cute army green long wool coat, sweaters, a cute scarf and long sleeve shirts. This all would have been fine walking from a parking lot to a store or home. Walking around downtown for hours? I was freeeezing!   Dresses would absolutely need tights or leggings unless, again, you're just in and out of heated areas. I found I was also cold wearing jeans alone outside. So day two I had a thermal long sleeve, a thin sweater over top, a scarf, tights under my jeans and my coat. Muuuuuuch better.   What clothing do you need?LAYERS! Dont underestimate the warmth you will get from a heavy scarf. A thin thermal shirt under a [heavy cableknit]( with jeans and [boots]( If you don't own boots and you can afford the investment, get a pair. If you're sightseeing you want to be able to walk comfortably in them, and there will probably be snow! I'd recommend boots with a small heel, cute and effective.Warm thick socks are a must. Keep your feet dry and taosty! Also, get a warm coat. My wool one was one layer, a good coat for texas but nowhere near good enough for 25 degree weather and a wicked wind chill. A hat is a good idea too."

Never liked the way I look...Going to assume that I never will quite frankly.  Seriously, I'm going to change my mid at 29?  Anyway, back to my point...I have a hard to dress shape.  I'm a petite hourglass.  XS are usual (and oddly) still too big.  To fit my chest or hips, the waist is ridiculously huge.  Add to that the drapy, flowy, straight, billowy trends, which make me look chunky/pregnant or like a kid playing dress up.  Nothing looks good, so I don't feel good.  I live in leggings/yoga pants and tanks tops with a sweatshirt if it's cold!  Living in PJs doesn't make one feel good."

RedPillWomen,"Questions, since you're the sigma expert:   1) I thought Alpha was hunky bad boy and Beta was adorable good boy. That made sense to me. Edward and Jacob, Gale and Peeta, we see it all the time in female psychology. What makes "Sigma" different from "introverted Alpha"?   2) Is this is a coherent typology? As in, do people really cluster into these categories?   For example, I'm attractive, tall, extroverted, thrive when surrounded by other people, and generally the loud center of attention in parties because I'm enthusiastic (Alpha). I'm generally sweet and kind to everyone, not even a touch of dark triad (Beta). My sexual partner count trends (Omega) but that's because of how often I have to turn people down due to humans being disgusting - I've had two wanting to cheat their boyfriends with me, two on self destructive spirals of sex and drugs, two were black out drunk so I didn't accept the consent, so on and so forth. The fact that simply  not being evil  has slashed my partner count by 90% among many other sad facts fuels my burning misanthropy (Gamma). I almost always feel that the LTRs who pass the great filter, including exes, are the most awesome people ever and don't hesitate to say so publicly and shower them with affection and otherwise pedestal them (Delta). My interests are primarily intellectual. I instantly nip the formation of social hierarchies in the bud via humor, sarcastic quips, or simply by laying people's games out explicitly...which gives me the reputation as the one with the conscience and I've been told that people are a little afraid of disappointing me. I have a reputation for non-conformity and not caring, and have experiences most people would consider trauma (Sigma). Then again, unlike Sigma I don't stick to any particular "tier or "league" and am happy to date "down" of I like someone.   Whichever one I pick will correspond to which positive qualities I like the best about myself (Or, if I'm feeling down, the negative qualities I pay most attention to). When I first read this, I found myself instantly gravitating to Sigma because I like to think I'm such a genius, but really I'm pretty extroverted and people-oriented and I don't have "4x average" partner count or any such nonsense. Being the weird nerd, I certainly can't lay claim to "alpha" in the "football star" sense.   When it's just alpha <-> beta, things make sense. We're saying something useful, we're positing a trade-off between two positive traits. It's clear that I'm naturally more "beta", since I trend more towards LTRs due to being kind and loyal, as opposed to being flashy, superficially romantic, always approaching and seeking hookups. It's clear what sorts of behaviors one can do to move from one category to another.   This expanded social heirarchy stuff doesn't really do that. I can easily convince myself that I am in any of them. The vast majority of people should be able to identify themselves in Delta. Do they? Can you convince us of the usefulness? Aren't people just picking Sigma and Alpha because they are the most flattering ones? Especially Sigma, on the internet, most people think they are smart..."
diabetes,"26yr T1, just completed a few rounds of laser treatments with a decent outcome so far. I avoided eye doctors for at least 8 years and could have been treated earlier but didn't.  My initial notice that something was wrong was after a flight from Orlando to New Orleans when I noticed my eye had partially filled with blood. Looked like a dangling piece of yarn that would move when I moved my eye. Real PITA when I had to drive home to Dallas from New Orleans due to full flights. I still have some debris/blood in my right eye from the initial bleed, but I'm' told that it should clear somewhat in the future and my vision is passable for driving and reading so I'm happy.   The treatment can be very painful unless they numb everything with a lidocaine shot first. This shot will cause temporary blindness since the optic nerve stops working too, so be prepared for a day with minimal vision in that eye. I had a total of four separate treatments, two left, two right separated by a few months each. Each treatment only took about 15 minutes and I was driven home by my wife.   You will likely need surgery but it's not as bad as it sounds."

Must sync while blood sugar is "stable".  This one alone is enough to completely fuck the product.  It doesn't  sound  like that bad of a requirement, but when you actually think about the consequences, it's horrible.  So you have to sync twice a day minimum.  So if your blood sugar must be stable, that means.. cant sync after eating anything, snack, meal, whatever (even longer if you ate complex carbs), cant sync after exercising, can't sync when you have a random liver spike, or random hypoglycemic attack.  You are basically forced to sync before eating a meal, which is a typical time your sugar will be stable.  However, if you have an irregular schedule, go out a lot, are on the road, lead a somewhat active varying lifestyle, there is NO GOOD TIME TO SYNC IT.  This leads it to be even farther off the mark than it is even with stable syncing.  It's such a crap product. Big surprise, the dexcom doesn't have this insane requirement."

diabetes,"Hey that's really good progress, keep it up :) sorry you've had to join our club, but you're in good company here.   Normally for great control you want to have your blood sugar under 6.5 most of the time. It will rise after meals (usually 9 is the max for those times though lower is better) but you want it to be back down within a couple of hours afterwards. This is not always easy, and don't freak out if sometimes you can't hit your targets, especially when you're new to this. Your downward trend is the most important thing right now.   Test your blood glucose a lot! Test it before meals, then 1h and 2h after to find out when your blood sugar peaks. For most people it's about 40-80 mins but high fat meals can delay the peak, and enhance or prolong it (this is why high carb+fat like pizza is very tricky for us!). Once you have a good idea of when you peak, just use that time to read and drop the other post meal test unless you feel weird.   Now, doctors will usually only care what your blood glucose is 2h after a meal, but don't care if you spike to 15 in between then drop down again. However, those spikes can do your body damage, so for the diabetic that's the one you want to control and that's why you need to find when you peak.   Keep track of what you eat and find out how much your blood sugar goes up for each amount of carbs you eat. You'll start to get an idea of what you should and should not eat. Spikes of >2 mmol are an indication that what you're eating is not being handled well by your body. >5 and just totally cut that out of your diet for now (you can experiment with these things later once you've got good at control). Be intense and diligent with this phase and it will save you a lot of work (and complications) later. You'll build up a library in your head of safe foods and know what to avoid.   Since you're type 2 you won't have to worry too much about hypos unless you're on insulin or strong meds, though it can happen as a reactionary hypo (where your body's insulin response is so slow that it kicks in after the sugar has already worn off, making you go low) . However if you get readings of less than 4mmol, have a snack of 15g sugar and test again after half an hour. Less than 3 and bust out the juice and candy. I don't expect this will happen though.   Ok so"

Diablo3Monks,"Keep in mind you're not really supposed to tank those hammer guys (with the obvious windup that plays a special sound before they hit).  They shouldn't really be your metric for whether you can increase your MP level.  There are other options for dealing with them that include:     Moving behind them so you don't get hit.   Activating Serenity (when you're jailed or something).   Hitting them with an interrupting move such as the last hit of Fists of Thunder. This one won't work on the elite versions of this mob.     I agree with jefrazie.  Your Armor looks OK (more than mine though I would like mine to be where yours is).  You need to look into kicking up your All Resist a bit though.  Target at least 500, with 600 being a nice value and 700 being great.   Also ensuring that you have a minimum of about 40k Life will ensure that you die less to those big spikes in damage (Savage Beast charge in Fields of Misery for example).   I would make a goal to being able to tank something like 1 Savage Beast charge, but not really 1 Fallen Maniac or huge windup swing from Mallet Lord or those Halls of Agony guys.   I checked on d3up and adding 200 more all resist and 100 more vitality gives you 139k more EHP.  So the final result of that would be the following:     457k EHP   90.85% damage reduction   41.9k life"
Diablo3Monks,"That extra MoC/OA actually sounds very doalbe and something I had never thought of.   Concerning your rotation and the lack of  ensuring  the MH is active prior to casting BF. Lets assume your MH attack speed is listed as 3.0 and you OH attack speed is listed as 2.5 as seen on d3up. Lets also assume that your MH weapons damage is 100K. These are all arbitrary numbers but they make the math easier ;)   So, if you follow the bell before BF method:     (100000   3.0   .75   12   1.48)   [(3.0   .3) + 1] = 7,592,400     If you skip that and wind up casting BF while the OH is active then you will end up with:   -(100000   3.0   .75   12   1.48)   [(2.5   .3) + 1] = 6,993,000   thats about an 8% difference. Not huge but still not optimal. Again, thats over the course of the first 3 sec.   So your method would keep that extra 48% buff going for the duration. So after BF the damage per bell is:     (100000   3.0   .75   12   1.48) = 3996000       as opposed to the "normal" after blind value of:     (100000   3.0   .75   12   1.24) = 3348000     so then your method increases the after BF/ inital MoC damage by ~16% as you have indicated.   So is it better to have an 8% increase for 3 sec or an 16% increase for 2 sec? In a perfect world you would want both. In that case we could change the steps to include the MoC refresh.   For simplicitys sake:     (Bell then BF) 3 * 7,592,400 = 22,777,200   (BF then Bell) 3 * 6,993,000 = 20,979,000     (MoC not refreshed) = 2 * 3348000 = 6,696,000     (Moc refreshed)      = 2 * 3996000  = 7,992,000     So, ideally doing both the Bell before BF and MoC refresh = 30,769,200 per Nirvana cycle.   Doing the BF before Bell and not refreshing MoC = 27,675,000 per Nirvana cycle. Thats about an ~ difference of 12.54.   That checks with out individual differences of 16% and 8% as (.16 * .08) = .0128 or 12.8%"
Bass,"During the Abbey Road recording sessions, a number of basses were used. It's believed Paul switched between his Hofner, Rick, and a Jazz during the recording sessions. Even Harrison used his Fender Bass IV on a couple tracks (Golden Slumbers, Maxwell's Silver Hammer, and Carry That Weight. IIRC). Though during the time when they put down Come Together, it was believed that he had the refinished Ric with him.   Paul's tone was a variety of things, but most of all it was a high quality tube studio compressor he used extensively. Get some flat wounds, or roll the treble/tone all the way off, and play with either pick or fingers to get the sound right. and just tweak. trust your ears. the tone is in your fingers ANYWAY, sorry for the rant."
Bass,"How well it turns out really just depends on your expectations...   You're not going to get an upright sound just by throwing a bow into the mix, obviously. But you can get some cool effects, without question.  There's a couple issues with doing this, namely:     The fretboard on an electric bass isn't really radiused enough to play anything but the outer strings.   The bow causes the string to vibrate in a different axis than the magnetic pickups on your bass were designed to pick up.  To expand on this:      If you don't know (forgive me if you do!), magnetic guitar pickups work by creating a magnetic field that the string vibrates within when it is struck.  The locus for these vibrations is the pole pieces on your pickup.  When you hit a string, you are causing tiny electromagnetic changes in the flux field generated by the pickups' magnet, and this magnetic change is centered most strongly at the pole pieces for the pickup.  This is why you have one pole piece under each string, because it allows for the most efficient changes in electromagnetic flux, and thereby the most sensitive pickups.   Because of the orientation of the strings vs. the pole pieces, the part of the strings' vibration which is actually picked up by your pickups (and then translated into electromagnetic changes, and later becomes the sound you hear when amplified) is basically the "vertical" axis - meaning,  your pickups most strongly sense the movement of the string away from, and back towards, the top of the pole piece.  The flux field is changed by lateral "side-to-side" motion as well, but traditional magnetic pickups mostly respond to vertical vibration.  Have you ever been playing REALLY hard (particularly with a pick or something) and attacked a note, which initially dropped off but then had a volume swell back up? You've heard the effect of too much lateral vibration.   Nearly all electric bass technique creates  vertical  vibration in the strings.  Bowing, on the other hand, creates primarily  lateral  motion in the strings, and in addition to that it actually suppresses the vertical motion of the string. When you lift the bow from the string, the vertical motion is allowed to come back, which causes a volume swell.  [You can hear that in effect in this video, particular at 2:37.](   The NS electric upright bass has a pickup system designed to combat exactly this issue I described.  [Here's the pickup page]( and there's a bunch of youtube videos out there.   Anyway, do whatever you want!  [It can be really beautiful.]("
Bass,"sorry to adivce something else, but i am deeply regretting spending around 80euros for practice amp when i started playing, because if you have active speakers it is much better to buy audio interface, if you have good speakers sound is infinitely better, and in software like guitar rig or amplitube you can mix lot of good sounds and use many effects, amps, ... and you can easily record yourself..."
Bass,"I was in the same boat. I'm right handed but i happen to be left handed when it comes to bass and guitar. My advice is, don't fight it. I know that it's easier finding deals for right handed ones and it can be frustrating finding as cheap, nice bass (thanks god for Squier VM Jazz bass), but it will be disencouraging if you try to fight your left-handiness. I had a "regular" guitar when I was 12 and I ever played because I wasn't comfortable with it. When I bought my first bass at 14, I bought a lef-handed one and I fell in love immediately."
logistics,"This all depends on what you'd actually be doing for them, which you're not very specific about. If this type of job is offered to industrial engineers versus say business analysts, I suspect it may come with some level of hands on project management, or possibly some process/automation engineering. Compared with a typical industrial engineer grad, you may be lacking a few skills that they have some training with, but in my experience, you'd both need to learn on the job anyway, so you realistically won't be far behind. Excel, Access, and other MS office stuff is pretty much a requirement for anyone doing anything related to business data. Possibly AutoCAD or similar if you end up doing any layout projects. You won't know some terms and jargon, but you could pick that up pretty quick. Speaking for myself and others I know in supply chain/logistics-majority of us had to learn quite a bit at the first job and still do as we move around the industry. FWIW a colleague of mine has a ChemE degree and has been in this industry for many years now. My degree doesn't exactly relate either, but is technical."
fountainpens,"Maybe I can help, I dislike broad nibs in general, and will rarely use them.  There are occasions, but they are special writing occasions, all other times, I like an EF preferably, and if I am writing large and quick, an F.  So there are my bonafides for explaining my point of view.   I have to make a special effort for my writing to be legible if I write with a broad, even a western medium is to broad for my writing.  The japanese EFs are perfect for my writing style actually, although a Pilot F is not bad, but an M is starting to push it to where I have to pay attention to my writing.  I also happen to love fountain pens, and am probably 5-10 years since I used a pen other than a fountain pen for much of anything other than a quick note.  They fit me better and I enjoy them more for writing.   Once tuned, I have never found the Japanese EF nibs to be scratchy, stiff or poor writers.  I actually have Pilot Metros that I rate just as smooth and pleasant to write with as really nice gold nibed pens, and have both side by side daily.  This may be the particular way I write, but they do work well for me.   Having said all of that, I do own some Broad nibs and stubs, and when I write a card or something like that, I will use them, since the stroke is more suited to the purpose."
networking,"It looks like all he needs is a small branch office type of firewall. With that in mind and obviously budget - the best bet is a SRX. Gartner, NSS, etc are a good read.   Other vendors as stated in these reports are: Check Point (Long time leader), Fortinet (child of netscreen), Dell Sonicwall (child of netscreen), Juniper SRX and Netscreen, Barracuda, Mcafee, Cisco, Palo Alto etc...   Out of all of the above - the best for small business is a SRX due to cost; if money is not an issue then I would be looking into Check Point; if looking for Next-Gen features such as Application Firewall - then Mcafee, Sonicwall, and Check Point;   If VPN is a requirement then Cisco ASA, Mcafee, and Check Point (Policy Based VPN is configured under 5 clicks)"

TwoXChromosomes,"I'm also originally from upstate New York, and the amount of "redneckism" is pretty shocking.  Some people are completely in the dark at how different NYC is from the rest of the state (which basically qualifies as "upstate").  By the way, I love New York.  The whole freakin' state.  :)  I've never been so proud to be from NY as the day when the Marriage Equality Act was passed.  And today, with the repeal of DADT, I feel incredibly proud to be an American.  ("
TwoXChromosomes,"In the hospital that I'm at, I use a combination of whatever soap they have and the waterless foam antibacterial stuff. My clinic site is in an area with an older population, and some uhh....  interesting  characters. Some patients I don't know what kind of skin condition they have, but after they leave I feel like I have to scrub for 10 minutes so I don't catch anything. A woman came through the other week with a stomach virus. 2 winters ago I wound up in a hospital with a terrible stomach virus and an irregular heart beat due to dehydration. After she left, I wiped the room down with these harsh "non-skin" disinfectant wipes because I was afraid of getting that stomach bug again.   This all makes me sound like a crazy germophobe but honestly it's only when I'm at the hospital. Sure, I wash my hands after I use the bathroom and stuff but if I drop food on my kitchen floor, I employ the 5 second rule, I let my dog lick my face and I play with his smelly gross toys. Those germs are mine (lol) and other peoples germs in the hospital scare me. Plus, cross contamination and direct/indirect contamination is a huge thing that's drilled into our heads at school so I'm just really careful. I can't afford to get sick and screw up school, which is why I sound so paranoid. It happened to me once before, I had withdraw from the semester after I was hospitalized."
TwoXChromosomes,"I think it's really great that you've acknowledged this and are actively seeking to change. You might want to just try to get more women in your life and try to have normal, everyday conversations. You don't have to like all women, some women will be really boring to you or seem stupid or childish or have interests that are completely incomprehensible to you. That's okay. Some men are like that too. Just find out what the women around you are interested in, you might find that you share a love of cooking or short stories or whatever you're interested in with her. Focus on these qualities and recognize that she thinks in a way very similar to you sometimes. She's a person, she has interests and flaws and quirks and habits just like you do.   I think your sister has left you with the feeling that women get to just coast through life and have everything handed to them. This might be true for some women, but it is also true for some men. As you start to realize that women are people just like you are, you might start to get to know some of them better and figure out that they have had a hard childhood too, maybe they had to work for everything that they have or got very little love from their parents or don't even have parents anymore. Just because the women in your early life had all the fun and got everything that they wanted doesn't mean that all women grew up that way."

TwoXChromosomes,"God forbid you get another perspective and break free from your little "eliptischlick" that you have going on here.   For the 100th fucking time, my original post had NOTHING to do with me being male, NOTHING.  It could have come from a female and had the same weight and affect.  YOU and your femsquad turned it into an issue.    And don't give me any more "woe is me" bullshit, rare subreddit?  Look at your damn sidebar, come on.   >a subreddit where discussion can finally be all about the female perspective, for once on this website, and start demanding that everybody considers the men?   Wow, if this isnt the most whiney, pathetic attempt at gathering some sympathy.  Look, first off  it's THE FUCKING INTERNET you dipshit.  If you get butthurt by any little thing like, someone presenting a perspective you don't like then perhaps you should reevaluate the amount of time you spend here.  You and i can go to any website we please if you think this subreddit is pure female and ONLY for a female perspective your are deluded.  Reddit is 72% male, you are GOING to have some cross over, get used to it.  We have females in ALL the male subreddits and we seem to handle it just fine without flipping our shit.  Im sure you will learn to do the same.   "LIFEZ SO HRD AMIRITE LADEEZ? NO1 UNDRSTANDZ OUR PROBLMZ WE ARE ALL TINY LITL SNOW FLAKZ!!  NO ONE GETS IT OR EVER CULD! AMIRITE LADEEEEZ?"  shit like this picture only perpetuate a stereotype. Females can be whoever the fuck they want to be, if you want to pigeon hole yourself into these catagories then be my guest.  But don't give me shit that males don't face similar problems albeit called different words.  my wife saw this post and said "welp, thats total bullshit".   > for once on this website   LOL!!!  Drama.   >and start demanding that everybody considers the men?   I dont recall demanding anything.  And it was a male perspective btw.  Lots of females felt the same way, i responded to numerous of them on here.  So clearly it is also a female perspective as well.    Btw you are fully welcome to ignore any "demands" thats what the downvote button is for.  Instead of whining about how you want to keep your little "clubs" integrity just fucking downvote."
TwoXChromosomes,"There's nothing wrong with wanting to be a young parent or an old parent. For my part, I want to be an old parent, partly because of the career path I've chosen and partly because I had an older mother (38) and a younger father (25) and I always got along better with my mother. I always felt like Dad wasn't quite ready for kids when we were little, but had to get ready because of Mom's age when they got married. She was 41 when my brother was born, and for both of us she's always had plenty of energy. When we were kids, she played with us all day all summer long since she was a teacher, and when we were older she never missed a game or performance. But then, she was always in pretty good shape and had generally taken care of herself her whole life.   It was also kind of cool having a parent who had been to Beatles concerts and war protests and kind of had a been there, made that mistake attitude about the crap we got into. Not to say we got away with things because she was old because we didn't, but she always had a milder reaction to things like my brother eating a bug or me putting a nail through my foot or both of us tracking mud and snow in the house. And it's not like she had any older kids, either. She was just a very mellow parent from the beginning.   I'm also not terribly worried about my fertility or my parents becoming grandparents, mostly because of our family history. I still have 3 grandparents, ages 72, 72, and 90, and two great-grandparents, ages 92 and 94. All of them are still lucid and all but the 94 year old live in their own homes and all of them have been active parts of my life. I would never want to deprive my children of that, but I can also count on my parents likely living to a ripe old age. Along the same lines, my mom was fertile into her 40's, as was her mother and my paternal great-grandmother. Come to think of it, all 4 of my great-grandmothers had children into their 40's, and all of them lived to be at least 80, with two of them getting to their 90's."

TwoXChromosomes,"Right? Whedon always makes me feel like a lady and a person. I wanted to include Dollhouse but I feel like that might be a little grown up plus so far I've really met girls who enjoyed it and most guys said it wasn't well planned enough or they found the plot superficial.   Also have you seen Princess Cookie? I must have rematched it 40 times by now an I still usually cry. That episode just has such an amazing message and The way they mirror Jakes simple dream with cookies complicated one is just.... Llllaaaaagh you know?"
TwoXChromosomes,"I have gone through a similar situation.  I lost my infant son 2 and a half years ago.  My relationships with everyone I knew before have changed.   Everyone.   It breaks my heart.  I must say that your letter was actually really good for me to read.  I think that as time passes, those of us who have lost a a baby begin to feel like those around us forget about our child.  To read this gives me a little hope that people in my life are remembering my son, even if they aren't telling me.   As for you and your friend, I am sorry there has been such a divide between you.  If it helps, know that the first year after losing a child (at least for me and others I know) is a complete and total blur.  Your only focus is getting thorough the day.  I have never been as selfish as I was that first year.  And honestly, anger toward those around me was helpful.  I was SO angry and I needed somewhere to direct it.  Is that fair?  Not at all.  But again, survival is the only goal at that point.   I agree with some of the other comments that it just may be too hard for her to see you with your kids right now.  Or that she seriously just has nothing to say.  Or it makes her sad to remember how things were or should be.  (Again, totally not fair, but true.)  Even now, it is much easier for me to be around my friends that have also lost a child.  There is no awkwardness like there sometimes is with my "old life" friends.   I'm sorry you are going though this and that she is going through this.  It just sucks.  You are a good friend, and I do believe some day she will come back into your life.  You are totally entitled to your feelings and I'm glad you were able to get them out in a safe space.  (And the fact that you did it here and didn't unload all this on her is further proof that you are a good friend.)   Something I would suggest (and take it or leave it, I'll never know!) is maybe sending her a text/facebook message/note tomorrow just simply saying something like "Just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you and your son yesterday.  Love you both."  I can tell you that it would mean the world to her.   Sorry this is such a novel!"
TwoXChromosomes,"In general - and particularly for days like this - you deal by focusing on things that you want to fill your life with.  Good friends, good books, other family members, whatever rocks your socks: hiking, cooking, swimming, coffee and pastry at the pavement bistro etc.   You become what you fill your life with.  If you focus on pain and loss and grief and separation... guess what your life will be filled with?  Fill your mind and your life with as many good, positive experiences as possible - they eventually help the bad stuff to recede into the background.  When you find yourself getting stuck into a groove of regrets and pain and 'what ifs' - train your brain to change track, and focus on something else (that doesn't mean don't think about it at all - but rather to stop if all that thinking is producing is pain instead of epiphany/growth). If you need help to move on, go to therapy.   Focus on the good - fill your life with things that make you happy.  One day, you'll see a little girl with her Father and you'll be able to go 'awww how precious' - and be happy for her, instead of sad for yourself.   FWIW - my bio Father was never there for me, he checked out after my parents divorced before I was 1.  My Step-Dad was my Dad, but he wasn't the warm fuzzy type. He was harsh and authoritarian and abusive and we clashed constantly. I can't say I've ever really felt loved from either of them - and it used to make me wonder what was wrong with me that not one, but two Fathers didn't love me.   Fortunately, I learned to fill my life with the good stuff, and that (and age) have allowed me to look back and not feel sad or depressed or angry about my upbringing. It helped make me who I am today, and if I hadn't grown up like that, I would be someone... different. I like me, so I am content.  Not sure if that all really made sense :)   In contrast, my Sister-In-Law has never, ever moved on from the damage done by her Father.  Granted, she has other issues, but her father committed suicide when she was 16, and she's 40 now and the pain is as fresh for her today as it was 24 years ago.  It has absolutely paralyzed her life.  Its like she's a record player that will occasionally produce lovely music, but then skips back and the needle gets stuck in the groove that produces nothing but wailing sad tones.  Nothing that anyone has tried has helped her. Not meds, not practical help, not therapy not children or other family, not early career success... nothing. Her brain brings her back to focus on the loss of her father - and she wallows in it. Its the saddest thing I've ever seen."
TwoXChromosomes,"I shower my grandpa in the most lavish gifts my broke college ass can afford. He is my only grandpa and my only "father." I make sure he knows how much I love him and appreciate the role he plays in my life.   For several years, I spent Father's Day eve getting so ridiculously shit faced that I would need the entire day to recuperate and sleep off my hang over. I finally realized that this wasn't doing anything except displacing my problem. Being bitter on Father's Day isn't going to make my dad want to be in my life any more than spending my entire day telling my grandpa how much I love him will.   Dude, my grandpa is one AWESOME son of a bitch. He is a WWII veteran, has read all the  Twilight  and Sookie Stackhouse novels, loves  Charmed  and any show on Sci Fi, and generally doesn't give a flying fuck about what anyone has to say about his preferences. He is my best friend, and I love him more than I can express. I am convinced that no matter who my dad is, he couldn't be better than my grandpa."
TwoXChromosomes,"Went through the same thing as a teen. I was 17, so my mom went to the doctor with me and I knew I wasn't pregnant, so I wasn't trippin'. Then the doctor asked if I was sexually active and all that and then I was freaking out a bit. Then I was scared that I was pregnant even though I knew I wasn't. Then she came back and was like you're not pregnant but your hormones are all jacked up and you've probably had an irregular cycle always, right? Then my mom, right before the doctor was leaving the room, "can we get a birth control prescription for her?""
TwoXChromosomes,"Whoa whoa whoa. I'm sorry, but there is some misinformation here that I need to correct for all the people who are reading this post.   Saying that 23andMe is capable of screening someone's genome is an over over statement. The panel of genes, mutations, and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that are covered are very specific and don't even come close to providing a proper assessment of overall risk in most cases. I will get back to this in a second.   In the case of the BRCA 1 and 2 genes, 23andMe ONLY looks at the 3 common Ashkenazi Jewish mutations (185delAG, 5382incC, and 6174delT), NOT the whole gene. Therefore, if OP had a BRCA1 mutation that was not 185delAG or 5382incC, this would not be an appropriate test for her daughter or any other family members. Doing this test when there is a different mutation in the family could lead to the false belief that the individual is not at risk when they very well may have inherited the BRCA1 genetic mutation. The best course of action for her daughter (should she wish to get tested, as an adult), would be to bring a copy of OP's genetic result to a genetic counsellor and be tested for that very same mutation in a CLIA certified clinical lab. This is the only way for her to know if she is at an increased risk to develop breast and/or ovarian cancer.   Yes, 23andMe can be a fun test that can tell you fun things about your ancestry. In some cases, it even has the potential to uncover true, actionable information (eg. carrier status, testing BRCA1 or 2 positive). HOWEVER, most of the information you get from a commercial test such as this is not necessarily truly validated for the "health risks". I would recommend that some of these results be taken with a grain of salt."
TwoXChromosomes,"I guess you could say that it was a combination of chance, maturity = no facades, and being open to making friendships.   When we first moved to our town (10 yrs ago) we wanted to meet people so we found a group of something that we liked just getting started on meetup.com so we joined. Met several good (though not best) friends that way. A few years later some of the people we met from that group had a party and we went with our then very fussy newborn.  At the party I started talking to this gal I hadn't met before and I realized we had amazing chemistry.  But I was too busy being a mom to get to know her or exchange info.   Fast forward a couple of years. My husband works for a national lab.  It's so large they have lunch clubs.  One of them was started by our friends who threw the party.  I went to one of their lunches with my husband and while there we met the gal from the party years before and her husband (they both worked at the lab).   We got on really well and had lots of chemistry and things in common (from work at the labs to having kids). She and I began emailing.  It turns out that she and her husband are avid board gamers, and while it wasn't something we were pursing at the moment, it sounded like fun.  They invited us to a couple of shindigs that they had (open gaming days at their house, even their anniversary party).  And it just blossomed from there.   Then through her and her husband we met another couple.  They weren't from the labs but they were big into gaming and they had kids. And we found out around the gaming table that we all had excellent chemistry and similar senses of humor.  The key point was that we were all pretty honest and didn't put on Facebook personalities. We had just reached a point in our lives where we're trying to do well for our families and generally enjoy life. It's less about winning popularity contests or impressing people.  I think it's easier to do this in your 30s + vs your 20s."

TwoXChromosomes,"Having been on weight loss programs myself, here's my advice:   Take it slow and steady. It's easy to try to starve yourself and lose as much weight as possible in a short amount of time, but that is NOT sustainable in the long run. If you set up a bunch of strict goals, you're setting yourself up for failure. In fact, you may even be purposefully sabotaging yourself because you WANT to see yourself fail.   In fact, I'd recommend not thinking about weight loss at all. Instead, think about being healthy. Constantly tell yourself that you're making a change for the better because you love yourself and you want to treat yourself right. If you start telling yourself that you hate who you are right now, stop that line of thinking right away and replace it with: the person I am right now is a STRONG person who wants to be more healthy and is making a positive change. If your parents are constantly hounding you about the weight, try to convince them that you're going to make positive changes but NOT because of your weight - rather just to be a healthier person. Encourage them to make positive changes to be healthier with you, so that you can support each other.   Finally, pick incremental goals, and don't do everything at once. A good first step might be just to track everything you eat. After two weeks or so of that, you can look at your habits and try to pick some easy goals. Maybe you notice that you drink a lot of soda, so you cut that down. Or you decide to just walk for 15 minutes a day. Easy goals that will help you build momentum and let you feel like you're achieving something.   As you start building momentum, focus on fitness and nutrition goals that will challenge you and show your progress. Like, walking a mile, or jogging for five minutes without stopping. Keep track of your personal records, and keep trying to beat yourself. I think a lot of people focus on weight because it's an easy number to track, but that fixation doesn't lead people to make healthy choices. Set a long-term goal, like finishing a 5k, and when you finally get there, it'll feel great! It doesn't matter what you weigh - if you're making a habit of jogging 5k, you're doing a lot for your own health and happiness.   Focus on making those changes lifetime habits, not quick fixes. Every time you want to make a change, ask yourself: can I live this way for my entire life? If the answer is no, then it's not a reasonable goal. If you're thinking about the goal: "I won't eat pizza for a month" but you can't imagine living your life without ever eating pizza again, you're setting yourself up to fail. Instead, think about minimum frequency you could eat pizza and still be happy (once a month?) and make THAT your goal."
TwoXChromosomes,"Because it's easier to use scare tactics to evoke emotion in people than actually find current research. To be fair I'm not entirely sure that journalists have been taught to properly scrutinize science papers like people who've studied any science have.   Look at that famous 10 year "women shouldn't wear bras" study. People kept citing that shit like it was the word of God, whereas someone with the most basic understanding of science research papers can tell you why you can't trust the researcher for three small reasons:     The sample size was too small. (Participants were all French woman between the ages 20-35)     The researcher never bothered looking at bra size and how that would affect the study. (If you're testing a hypothesis you should have some sort of measuring tool to know what to look for)     It wasn't double blind. (If you really want to test a medicine you have one placebo group and one test group, if you REALLY want to test it you make sure you don't know who is taking the medicine and who is consuming the sugar pill.)       Lastly, you re-test if you get the same results each time then it turns into a phenomenon and you have a theory."
TwoXChromosomes,"My step father raped me from the age of 12 to 16. It resulted in a pregnancy and subsequent abortion. My mother became aware at that time, although I suspect she was aware before. I testified. I talked. I gave dates that they could prove. I named times and places in which I was dragged to hotels. I also had witness to him beating me and my younger sisters.   I don't mean that we were smacked. I mean he hit us with a rake handle until the wood broke in half.   I stood in front of a judge and shakily told him what happened. My step father's attorney suggested that I was jealous of my mother and I had been seducing him for a while and while I wasn't at fault, I was complicit.   We were not rich. We were middle class. He received 4 months in jail. They decided he could only be charged with 4 accounts of statutory rape.   He wrote me from jail and said he found God and I should too.   It isn't about money.

TwoXChromosomes,"No, a "false accusation" is when there is definitive evidence that鈥攂eyond a reasonable doubt鈥攖he accused did not commit a crime. This was not the case in the OP.   An example would be if you accused me of stealing your car and I provided undeniable evidence (e.g., a plane ticket, hotel receipt, credit card chargers, and surveillance footage) that proved that I was not in the city or country when your car was stolen.  In this case, I am legally  innocent  and your accusation is proven false.   The other scenario is that you fail to provide sufficient evidence that proves within a reasonable doubt that I stole your car. In this case, I would be " not guilty " (which has a different legal definition than "innocent"). Your accusation wouldn't be counted as "false" because there wasn't enough evidence to prove that I did or did not steal your car. And please note that is a direct consequence of  innocent until proven guilty ."

TwoXChromosomes,"I think in my case it was a bit harder to wiggle away from the truth. My step father had bragged to some co workers that he had taken my virginity, at least that is what I have heard. It was because he owed them money that they contacted the police and then backed up my statement. It then became possible to force my mother to admit that she had taken me to get an abortion and that she was aware of my assault.   I think if it was just me, standing alone, with no one to back up my story, the case would have been dropped. My advocate seemed to be surprised he even got 4 months. I think everyone was expecting him to get a warning.   What is really fucked up is that while waiting for the court case to make it's way through the system, I was in foster care. My sisters remained in the home with him. The courts ordered our entire family to attend therapy together.   Together is the important word here. Once a week, I was forced into a small room with him and my mother as they talked about how hard this was on them. The cost of attorneys and how much they had to sacrifices to make ends meet. At one point, I felt so guilty that my sisters didn't have any pocket money or new shoes for school or that they couldn't afford school supplies, that I told my advocate and foster parents that I no longer wanted to testify.   I just wanted to make it all stop. Thankfully my foster mom marched down to CPS and demanded they stop forcing me into therapy with my abuser and remove any means of communication between me and my parents.   That foster mom saved my life I think."
TwoXChromosomes,"There's a  lot  of powerful people, especially powerful men, who has sexually assaulted another human being. They "can have anything in the world", o.k, that's pretty right. They could buy mansions, luxury cars, have respect from other people for their status/works.. but it didn't stop many of them from raping another person. Why?   Because it didn't matter. Sexual assault is about power. One of the many reasons why so many people didn't believe Dylan Farrow (Woody Allen's stepdaughter) when she said that he sexually assaulted her when she was a child is because  they do not believe  how someone  oh so powerful , so prolific, so great, so rich, so acclaimed and famous could so something that could destroy his whole career and life.   Some people were  furious  whenever someone from a low socio-economic class say that they've been sexually assaulted by someone rich and famous. They'll say,  oh he have everything how could he did that? the accuser must be lying! she must've wanted the fame/his money so she made the case up!  and other rationalizations even when the evidence overwhelmingly say the opposite.   The view that "the man can have anything in the god damn world" and still chose to do something heinous and illogical like molesting his stepdaughter is not an incongruous one.   edit :"
TwoXChromosomes,"I think the biggest problem is that it is very difficult to prove non-physical abuse, regardless of the victim(or offender)'s sex. Unless the incident is recorded, it is just one person's word against another. So people in abusive relationships don't have a clear "out".   Also, abuse in general doesn't usually start at such an extreme level, or the victim wouldn't have stayed long enough for it to become such an issue. It is like a bad habit. Nobody is nice to everyone all the time, and the occasional heated disagreement is hardly a bad thing. It shows that the people involved actually care about the issue at hand and what the other person thinks about it. The problem is when things become more and more one-sided, or either party attempts to control the other.   Keep in mind that you can't force an ideology into someone's head, no matter how morally sound it is. If you want more guys to understand and empathize, you have to be able to connect with them. Communicate in a way they'll better understand, as they have no sense of obligation to listen to your stance. People tend to be somewhat attached to the way they think, and people who think differently are simply wrong. That isn't to say you can't change someone's attitude, it is just difficult.   Entertaining the idea that abuse doesn't require physical damage opens up another can of worms; "battered husbands". Being the victim of abuse -- hell, being a victim in general -- is pretty much the antithesis of modern concepts of masculinity. So there will be some resistance to the idea from a good chunk of men, along with the SJW "men can't be abused" crowd."

Before I get into why I think the decision makes sense, I'd like to explain the decision a little. For those of you who would rather read a somewhat longer plain-English summary of the Court's decision, SCOTUSBlog has a really good [article]( on it. And [here's]( the link to the decision itself.   First, I'd like to point out what the decision does  not  say. It does not say that protestors at abortion clinics can get up in the faces of people coming to get an abortion. In fact, the Court specifically pointed out that under existing Massachusetts law, the state may arrest and prosecute anyone who harasses people trying to get an abortion or blocks the entrance to the abortion clinic.   The abortion protestors in this particular case described themselves as wanting to provide quiet counseling to people entering the abortion clinic. The facts of the case state that the protestors who brought the case limited themselves to quietly passing out literature and saying things like, "Good morning, may I give you my literature? Is there anything I can do for you? I'm available if you have any questions." (This is a quote from the case itself.) In fact, the Court found it particularly troubling that the buffer zones essentially forced protestors to scream if they wanted to be heard, instead of quietly handing out literature and offering counseling, as these particular protestors wished to do.   The Court put particular emphasis on Massachusetts' other alternatives to the buffer zone---alternatives that would have protected the rights of the abortion clinic's patients while still allowing quiet street counseling. Part of the law that was not struck down prohibits getting in people's way as they are trying to enter the abortion clinic, or harassing them, or intimidating them. The Court did not strike down these parts of the law. People who violate this part of the law can be arrested, prosecuted, and jailed.   Because the law made it much harder than necessary for people to express their opinions to others, the Court struck it down. I think that this makes sense. People entering an abortion clinic may be in a particularly vulnerable place mentally, but the whole point of the First Amendment is to allow public discourse on issues, and to allow people to hear speech that they may not want to hear. That was, in fact, the Court's point: modern life is full of instances where we can just turn off speech that we don't like (change the channel, leave the website, etc.); the public streets are one of the only exceptions to this rule. The Court therefore acted to protect speech while still leaving open options for dealing with people who are abusive or threatening."
TwoXChromosomes,"You looked fantastic in all the photos on that post!   It's so silly and pathetic that you can express anger and distaste from adopting a fictional and loved character into the real world, just because of skin colour.   If you couldn't wear a costume from a character (in a series/comic/manga/film) that you love because of what race or tone you are, then that should be the same for everyone. Don't get me started on if mixed raced people had to cosplay accordingly! For example, Sailor Moon would have to be exclusively cosplayed by a Japanese Girl with the same complexion; Or Captain America has to be cosplayed by an American Caucasian Boy."
TwoXChromosomes,"Black female geek weighing in: Growing up in my geeky circles I would always hear my fellow geeks look down on the "jocks" and "popular" kids for being so exclusive or intolerant of kids that weren't "cool" like them.  There was this attitude that we were somehow better than them because we didn't exclude others due to their looks, athletic ability,  knowledge of sports, hobbies.   As I got older, I realized that that is largely bullshit. The things that you are into, the hobbies you enjoy and the type of media you consume do NOT dictate your morals, kindness, inclusiveness,  tolerance,  etc.   I can't tell you how many geek men I've encountered who have decided that they need to quiz me after hearing that I love manga and videogames.   Being a geek doesn't make you immune to be a bigot, racist, sexist, closed-minded, or cowardly; the replies on your tumblr post are proof of that.   All in all, I was really touched by your story.  Keep doing what you love! Maybe one of these days I'll finally cosplay as Cammy!"
TwoXChromosomes,"I usually stick to commenting on the parody "jerk" subs for stupid fun but this has turned into such a reddit circle jerk I have to chime in.   I think a lot of people have missed the point and are over reacting. I didn't grow up in the U.S. (or western Europe) so race was never an issue. If you were describing a black person you didn't stumble around it, you called him black. If you were describing an Asian you called him short and thin eyed. That's how they look. It was very hard for me to get used to these sensitivities when I came to the U.S. The U.S. pretends not to notice race to avoid uncomfortable feelings since there are still plenty of people alive who remember segregation in the country (I surmise). But that's ludicrous. Of course you notice what color somebody is! To pretend not to is to pretend to be an idiot.   When someone says, "For a black cosplayer (not to be racist) she did an amazing job!" What they mean is, "Her costume looks amazing, would look just like the character except for the fact that the complete opposite color of skin makes it look nothing like her." Only in the U.S. (and western Europe) would you even add "not to be racist." Of course you're not being racist. You're stating a fact that the skin color throws off the look of an otherwise perfectly executed costume.   I'm sure there are some people who use things like that to be racist. But I'm willing to bet many are just trying to tip toe around the elephant in the room (that someone of a completely different race dressing up as a character of another DOESN'T look like the character even if the costume is perfect). Back home if a black guy dressed up as Superman no one would say, "You look just like superman!" No, we would say, "Great costume, you know except for the fact you're black and look nothing like him," and have a laugh. The same way if a fat white guy dressed up in a trench coat, sunglasses, and a katana no one would say, "You look just like Blade!" We'd say, "Oh look, it's butterknife, Blade's fat, white sidekick," with a laugh."
TwoXChromosomes,"No?  I'm not even sure what this comment means.   I'll change the analogy.   You joined a co-ed basketball recreational league.  You are the first girl to officially join, even though the league has been technically coed for years.  You end up being the best player on the team.  Is it a complement when your teammates say "You're pretty good, for a woman"?   I think not.  Professional, non professional, paid, unpaid, whatever.  Cosplay is a hobby, it shouldn't be graded or critiqued or held to a weird standard.  She did a great job FOR ANYONE, there is no reason to bring race into it.  Besides, when white girls cosplay as Sailor Moon characters, no one says "She did a great job for a white girl" (Since Sailor Moon is an ASIAN show full of ASIAN characters).  I mean the whole thing, and the way you're coming off trying to explain it, basically says "White is the normal anything other than white is different and therefore I should point that out to make sure eveyrone knows how abnormal and unusual it is."  That is shitty.  White isn't the "norm" by which all things should be judged.  If the person had said "For a nonJapanese woman she did an awesome job" that would be an important distinction.  There she is pointing out that the cosplayer is different from the race of the character, instead of pointing out that being black pretending to be a Japanese character is weird compared to a white person pretending to be a Japanese character.   Whenever you says "For a ___" you are automatically starting off by saying the person in question is at a disadvantage, in this case, because she's black.  Saying her natural skin color is a disadvantage is insulting.   And really, beyond that, people not of color really, really, REALLY don't get to tell minorities what they should or should not find offensive.  She found it offensive, there for it was.   Edit:   And if you're one of those people who thinks that Japanese Manga characters "look white" then I have a youtube video on that I can dig up for you."
TwoXChromosomes,"I'm 26 years old, and while I wear makeup every day, I don't wear much. I hate foundation, and only wear it to weddings/formal events. I use concealer some days to cover up the under-eye circles that are also hereditary (Thanks Mom!) and pressed powder to even out my skin tone, mascara pretty much every day, eye liner sometimes, and every once in a while eye shadow.   I used to have acne pretty bad, so I have a little scarring from it. I mostly wear powder to blend that a little. I had a bad bout of dermatitis on my face a few years ago, and makeup made it worse, so I didn't wear any for a month or two... It was almost liberating. I just kind of had to be like, "this is my face, deal with it!" and it was nice. I mean, it was stressful because I had just started a new job, but it helped me to learn to be confident, whether I liked how my face looked or not."
TwoXChromosomes,"From a guy - He's not worth it.   Time is basically the only thing that will get you through a break up.

TwoXChromosomes,"I think what tends to offend people is the comparative aspect of it.  "You look bett er , pretti er , etc..."

TwoXChromosomes,"I agree with all of the legal ramifications that /u/OneEsk  brought up. I want my SO there for me and I want to be able to provide for him should I pass away.   My anti-marriage feelings have melted away - but it's definitely not for everyone. My SO is a pain in my ass, but is the love of my life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.   yes, I took vows in front of family and friends, but it wouldn't have mattered one bit if those people weren't there. Those vows were between me and my SO, and they were completely devoid of religion. We got married because it was what we both wanted out of life, not because it was what our friends were doing (it was the exact opposite of what our friends were doing), or what our families wanted for us.   but as much as it works for me - there are people like, hm, my mother - that it didn't work out well for - she had three marriages - the 1st one (my father) - he turned out to be gay, the 2nd was an abusive alcoholic that drove into our apartment building one night, and her last marriage was the one that stuck but they were together 10 years and had bought a house before even thinking about getting married."

It's years later and I still love her, but she could give about a fuck less.   We started taking again. At first I applied standard text book PUA and the conversations would get sexual, but I reverted to woo I used to be ended up going out with her then she more out less said we only friends blablah I'm drunk and at snow globe.

TwoXChromosomes,"I walk to bank everyday for work, about 4:30 pm (broad daylight). I have had people yell at me and the like, and one time thought I was being followed. Enough to make you walk faster but they can't really get to me with a car due to there being several parking lots/curbs/roads and this is a very public route so nbd. I've walked everyday for  five years, uncomfortable situations pretty rare.   So one day I'm walking along and this older suv pulls up, I'm somewhat behind a gas station and while not completely out of visibility of the public, not really in plain sight either. I'm prepared to keep walking after this suv pulls up, but I see that it's just some kid (18, maybe) and think, "oh it's just a kid, can't do any harm."   So he asks me where "main" st is. Being the friendly and helpful person that I like to think I am, I proceed to explain. He looks... Uncomfortable. He says, "um... Where is it?" Thinking I didn't explain it well, I proceed to explain again. It's like, two blocks away. Not complicated.   But he still looks, perplexed. He says, "um.. Can you come closer? I can't hear you." I take half a step closer and kind of say something like, "um, it's just right there." I really don't want to explain it again and I'm not sure this person should be behind the wheel of a motor vehicle if he can't understand simple directions.   So then he asks if he can ask me a question. I don't know how I could have possibly not realized something was amiss by this point. I say ok. He asks if he can see my boobs.   Hahaha that kid really just asked if he can see my boobs. I say, "No, you cannot see my boobs" and decide it was time to keep walking.   So  then  He looks down at his crotch, where he is  vigorously jerking his fully erect penis     and asks, almost pleads, "well will you at least give me a hand job?!? I'll give you twenty dollars!!! Please!!!!"   I know it was just a kid. But it was truly, very disturbing. I called someone to pick me up after that and didn't walk there again for awhile. I really need to get mase or something.   The sad part is, he wasn't an unattractive dude. He was pretty well endowed, not that i care about that, just.... Didn't have anything to be nervous about in that department. Just seemed a little, like, you know, the kids who were a little weird in school, wore darker clothes and tobogons, my kind of people, actually. Too young but had he asked a girl on a date and treated her nicely, showed her respect and genuinely cared about her, she would've had sex with him. It sucks he felt like he had to ask a strange woman on the street for a favor the  way     he asked, the sound of desperation in his voice. I kind of wish I could tell him that, after the initial horror of that experience has worn off. Kid, you're alright. You'll find someone someday. Just keep that thing in your pants when you're out in the general public. At least buy a girl a drink first, damn."
TwoXChromosomes,"You also have accused of people going "LALALA NOT LISTENING" I fail to see a difference in your "respond to nonsense with nonsense" method.   You simply apply a filter despite clearly lacking knowledge on the subject, and then project your own lack of comprehension as the speaker talking nonsense. A very stereotypical small town attitude.   Having displayed a lack of basic humanity by responding to a question asking if you felt a child should work 14 hours daily with "I believe children should have responsibilities." You still speak as a human rights authority.   I think one can safely assume that you would find it acceptable that despite women in the USA being given the right to vote in 1920, it took until 1938 for america to restrict child labor in factories and other industrial settings.   As you pointed out in another post about working on your neighbours farm, this failed to include agriculture, and so 500,000 children work, to various degrees, obviously. This is the result of a loop hole being exploited and being told through generations it builds character.   I am not against children lending a hand on the farm within reason, I am not against the fair treatment of women.   I am against people who condescend from a point of ignorance, as though that were the same thing as authority and expect to be lauded as cool and unflappable when they withdraw into a shell of pre-rehearsed one-liners and insults. Thinking that, by frustrating any attempt at discourse, you have actually won the argument. You think your gender matters at all? I used the pronoun she, because this is a subreddit for women despite its many male visitors. Please do not make this about your gender as if by revealing your trump card I will be stunned.   I genuinely despise the type of willful ignorance you display as the issue with modern society, all the frustrating environmental issues the "debate" on the reality of global warming, all the backwards religious bodies bloated with followers who will defend their dogma to the death at the drop of a hat, all of that to me stems from the same backwards mentality that change is inherently bad.   Nobody is disputing the existence of gender/racial/age inequalities and the need to address them, what people are disputing is the notion that 'The Patriarchy', the zeitgeist lurking manipulator, as it has been depicted by yourself and others is the sole cause of the situation and every unfavourable situation, and always has been.   I am not for propping up figureheads to toss stones at and I am not for blaming whole bodies for the acts of individuals. I am not for willfully ignoring facts as they are presented and then calling them nonsense. And even though I cannot condone willful ignorance I should not demonize you for it.   The Bard once said something about there being lots of stuff in the heavens and on the earth and its true, theres so much to see and learn and hear and feel and so many people to meet. It almost seems impossible to even make a ripple in the pond as it where.   It can be scary to open yourself up to that unimaginable vastness and not fear losing something, you are never certain quite what, you perceive as core to yourself. But thats the beauty, The constant change the mutable nature of life and thought lets what you are stay the same but slowly grow. And having grown see the world in a way your old self would have thought uncanny.   I am for the equal treatment of all human beings, and I am for the entire world becoming safe for anyone. I am for myself and for every other organism on this orb because frankly without them I would not exist, and to deny them the same joy in their lives would be wrong.   Thanks for helping me learn to not resent you.   sincerely:     A "Whiny man who is stressed out""
TwoXChromosomes,"HolidayBlues is something of a troll who believes feminism is hate speech and that women should beautify themselves for the same reason wealthy neighbourhoods should have uniform architecture and trimmed hedges- public beautification. So, he sees us as objects. Literally. That's where he and the links he posts are coming from.   As to that "Myth#2" let me break it down for you:   >Fact: The 75 cent figure is terribly misleading. This statistic is a snapshot of all current full-time workers. It does not consider relevant  factors like length of time in the workplace, education, occupation, and number of hours worked per week. (The experience gap is particularly large between older men and women in the workplace.)  When economists do the proper controls, the so-called gender wage gap narrows to the point of vanishing.   Emphasis mine.   The part I bolded is the critical bit. This is often used as an excuse for the wage gap. However, people who deploy that standard line tend not to ask  why  women work fewer hours,  why  there is a glaring experience gap among older workers, and so on and so on.   The main "myth" about the wage gap is that  all  women make 75 cents on comparable men's dollar across the board. This obviously is not true. The gap emerges because society makes it harder for women to work, basically. Social standards surrounding motherhood, for example, stigmatise women who work long hours or who work hard after having a baby. Many women (as some recent high profile lawsuits against big firms are showing) are actually  forced  to reduce hours or are even made redundant after having kids, in a way fathers rarely experience just because they suddenly became dads.   If you are expected to take five to ten years off of work, or work only part time during that period, that causes an experience gap that is very hard for women to overcome.   As to education, as groups in the US men and women tend to have similar levels thereof, to the point where it cannot be said to appreciably affect the wage gap.   But there is an interesting point to be made about that. Blue collar jobs that men could get on high school diplomas (which remain male dominated) are often unionised and pay well.   So called pink-collar jobs, which are jobs that are predominantly or even almost exclusively female, tend to pay a lot less. Some, like waitressing, are part of an income bracket that is legally allowed to pay less than minimum wage (because tips are supposed to make up the difference). The devaluing of so called "women's work" is part of the problem.   Even in high class fields like academia, male dominated math and physics pays more than gender-equal biology.   This is part of the reason women are cramming into colleges because many of us know that if we want decent incomes we really cannot afford  not  to. The corollary to this, which is a developing story in modern politics, is that men are going to feel the burn of this too very soon. Those blue collar jobs I mentioned are rapidly disappearing, and men who could get by on HS diplomas are beginning to find they no longer can.   At any rate, the causes of the wage gap are myriad. It does not arise from every single boss saying "I'm going to pay you a quarter less because you're a woman." It's a slow, social process that is often unconscious (although overt and direct sexism occurs as it did in the Lily Ledbetter case).   I'm already going on too long but another part of the problem is that because assertiveness tends to be rewarded in men but seen as a sign of ill-temperament among women, men tend to  ask  for raises more often than women do.   Misogyny plays a huge role in all of this, but it's not direct person-to-person sexism in many cases. In some, it takes the form of, say, firing a pregnant mum. In others it's something that gradually happens as women enter a profession.   The uber"
TwoXChromosomes,"fucking OWNED   But really, in the sake of helping a fellow guy out, the single best thing I ever did to win attention and admiration from women around me was simply two things: be interesting and confident.   I used to be a shut in, lamenting the fact that women didn't fawn over me and come crashing down my door, when I realized I was simply just not all that interesting. I then decided to start doing all the things I've wanted to do for MYSELF (hiking, kayaking, rock climbing, longboarding, etc etc). After I started doing these things, I noticed that when I would start talking to the people around me (men and women) were FAR more interested in getting to know me since I had a lot of qualities they found cool/fun/etc outside of watching TV and sitting around. This then boosted my confidence and made me go out finding more things to do, which further helped my confidence, and this all became a kind of self-perpetuating loop. Also, taking care to look attractive helps (people like talking to pretty people). Don't fret too much about it though, a LOT of people have been in the same boat as you."
TwoXChromosomes,"I have this quilt, that was kind of my grandma's quilt, except she never actually saw it. Some friends of the family bought it for her for her 83rd birthday, but she passed away unexpectedly a little less than a week before it. At the funeral reception, instead of putting out a guest book, these friends that bought the quilt put it out with sharpies. Everyone signed it. (I mean EVERYONE; my grandma was one of the exceptional people that everyone knew and loved, to the point that her funeral was standing room only.) But, when everyone signed the blanket, they signed it TO her, not US, the immediate family. It reminds me that there's so much love that she received, and I know it's because she loved so much first, and when I curl up in the blanket, it reminds me that I was one of the closest people in her life and that even though she's gone, that love is still there whenever life gets rough and I need it."
TwoXChromosomes,"Wow, this turned out really long.   I think people took offense to the term "laziness."   I nursed my daughter exclusively for six months and it took a long time for me to enjoy it.  Nursing is hard work, lots of babies don't latch on, your supply will go up and down in the beginning, you're constantly leaking, and, to top it all off, your emotions are going nuts from childbirth.  Nursing is not the immediately beautiful and natural thing it's made out to be (at least not for all of us).   I don't know if it's laziness that brings women to formula.  I think it's three main factors:   One. A lack of education and support from the medical community.   I wish just once the lactation consultant in the hospital had said "look, this is probably going to be awful the first few weeks.  It's normal to have pain, it's normal for you to leak, it's normal for the baby to have latch issues.  Just try to stick with it and it will get better"   If I'd heard that right away, I wouldn't have felt like I was doing it wrong and would have felt less overwhelmed.  I got that talk from my sister and did stick with it and it got better.   Regarding medical support, most hospitals give out formula when you are leaving with the baby- that's basically a medical endorsement of formula.  And, while the pediatrician thought it was great I was nursing, they also want to get hard figure on how much the baby is drinking, which you of course can't do with nursing.   So a lot of women feel pressured to switch to a method that will be easier to quantify.   Also, regarding education, I hear a lot from people that their milk dried up or they didn't have enough.  One of the first things my (second) lactation consultant said was that women think their milk is drying up when their supply is just evening out.  It just feels empty because they had so much more milk than they needed at first.   So, while I'm sure plenty of women do have supply issues, from what I've learned it's more common that they're not getting the whole story about supply at the beginning.   Two. You have so much other stuff going on emotionally and physically, switching to forumla seems like a great decision you can control.   Three. Working.  Before the big formula push in the 1940/1950's, most women were at home near their baby.  It's a relatively new phenomenon that new mothers are away from their babies.   Not all employers are supportive of pumping or you just can't work it in.  I travel for work, which is why I had to to stop nursing earlier than I'd planned.  Even though I pumped regularly when traveling, I couldn't keep the supply up and had to start weaning at 6 months."
TwoXChromosomes,"I recently gained a good deal of weight and turned 35.  I think the weight is mostly a shift in my metabolism due to age, and also eating dinner at my parents', which I hadn't been doing when I lived 3,000 miles away from them a year and a half ago.  Sometimes it bums me out that I now need a 10 or 12 rather than a 4 or 6, but I'm also kind of enjoying being bigger.   Whenever I have that little lamenting thought about how little I was and now am not, I remind myself of the feminist theories that identify our value of thinness in women as being a social desire for women to be "small" and take up little space, which is one of the ways we as women internalize and perform our "place" in the world.  Now I'm reminding myself to revel in the space I take up.   I also bought four new pairs of rockin' jeans yesterday that my beautifully bigger butt looks fantastic in, and that are so comfortable I can sleep in them.  And I donated oodles of itty-bitty clothes to charity, liberating closet space for my new and fabulous wardrobe."
TwoXChromosomes,"24 year old software engineer specializing in financial software. I read primarily magazines, non-fiction and reddit. The magazines are read are 30% for interesting articles, 10% fiction (short stories ftw), 20% mindless tripe (top ten tech trends to watch, interviews on what xx thinks about yy), 20% restaurant/bar/wine/food reviews, 10% misc.   There's no one issue I feel extra concerned with, but I do donate to the ACLU monthly and occasionally to [the smile train]( I'm also active in a few communities that promote math, tech and science to young female students. Gotta represent!   On politics: I cannot stand sensationalism and will not take it seriously. It's for this reason that I dislike most political editorials. I also dislike reading most interviews, although thats mostly because I feel like the candidate always gives overly-practiced responses that don't tell me anything.   On feminine topics: Maybe its just because I'm in such a male dominated field, but I never feel like articles written by females for females are at any way meant for me. My interests actually align must closer to what I see in city-specific publications (in nyc) - restaurant/wine/show/book reviews, interior decorating, domestic and international travel, life hacks. I also like video game/tv/movie reviews. And gadget reviews. I'm a sucker for reviews.   Non-fiction: If its well written, the topic doesn't matter. What I choose to read is sometimes random, but I almost always read it if its history, health, tech or world news related.   Fiction: 1000k words or less. Once again, as long as its well written, any genre goes (including chick-lit).   Misc: Sudoku and crossword puzzles, please. I also like really short tidbits of random info in random places. "The more you know" or "TIL" or "YSK" kind of random stuff.   The coolest things I ever buy are non-durable and are usually consumed immediately. That '93 Cab from Sonoma. That $$$ bill on a fancy restaurant with a famous chef. Those radiohead tickets. Oh! Also one of those panda hats. I'm also a sucker for adorable hats.

Has my metabolism slowed down yet? Will I get fat if I continue this lifestyle?   How my boyfriend thinks of me.   How my boyfriend's friends think of me.   My frustratingly high libido + the decline of sex in my life. It makes me go crazy and doubt everything. Right now I'm so insecure about my body that I can barely handle being naked, even alone, which makes masturbating confusing which makes me extra frustrated.   My anxiety, and how it's affecting my boyfriend. That makes me uber anxious.   Not having friends in the new town I live in.   My armpit hair is really dark and thick. Also my moustache upsets me.   The fact that I've written this out twice because I wasn't sure whether or not to post. Pro: It let's me vent. Con: I don't want to guilt my boyfriend who will read this, it's ALL me. and because writing all this out makes me want to cry."

TwoXChromosomes,"I'll try to lay out a few possible reasons for why people are homophobic, and the short answer is: bigotry comes in many forms, and all are insidious. Please note: this list is not exhaustive.   1)  Homophobia as reinforcement of categories.  Professor Elizabeth Young-Bruehl, a psychotherapist, makes the point that homophobia is quite unique among other kinds of hatreds in that it starts off as a  hatred of certain acts, which is then extended to a class of people. Other hatreds, e.g. antipathy to blacks or women, are expressed in terms of general categories. She suggests that homophobes hate acts that they themselves can and usually do engage in, so, to repudiate these acts they must assign them clearly to another category of people. The category is all that stands between them and those acts. [See this awesome book for more.](   2)  Homophobia as an extension of sexism.  Male prejudice against gay males is a form of sexism. It is part of male denigration of femaleness. The psychoanalyst [Richard Isay]( has argued that fear of homosexuality per se is secondary in homophobic men to their fear and hatred of what they perceive as feminine in other men and in themselves.   For this reason, men are not generally prejudiced against lesbians, who present no threat to their masculinity. However, some men view butch lesbians as competitors for the attention of women, and see in femme lesbians a spurning of men. Sometimes we see the reaction where the men say, let鈥檚 show them what real love is -- and from here, it鈥檚 a short hop to sexual assault (i.e., "corrective rape")   3)  Homophobes are authoritarian, status conscious, intolerant of ambiguity and rigid  Researchers using questionnaires and interviews have developed a profile of the homophobic person. He or she is authoritarian, status conscious, intolerant of ambiguity, and both cognitively and sexually rigid. But the homophobes thus profiled are motivated less by conventional sexual morality than by a desire to preserve a double standard between the sexes, that is, to preserve traditional-- traditionally sexist--masculine and feminine gender roles. [See here for more.](   4)  Homophobia as internal anxiety redirected outwards  Some researchers have postulated that homosexuality is an anxiety-based phenomenon. Psychoanalytic theories suggest that homophobia is a result of repressed homosexual urges. Anxiety about homosexuality typically does not occur in individuals who are same-sex oriented. Instead, it usually involves individuals who are ostensibly heterosexual but have difficulty integrating their homosexual feelings or activity. [See here for more.](   5)  An "Us v. Them" mentality.  This is the subconscious belief that if someone else is granted rights, those rights come at one's own expense. You see this play out in most forms of oppression. One of the most common reasons why some oppose gay marriage is that it will somehow threaten or devalue the heterosexual institution of marriage. In order for one person to have rights, the rights of another are somehow infringed upon (another classic example: when women were granted the right to vote, the general view wasn't that women gained the right to vote, but that men's right to vote was devalued as a result). Just how that would happen is never explained, but those who agree with the notion don't have to explain; to them it seems a reasonable proposition, because they feel the threat, even if they can't put their finger on why. Obviously, this reason is an emotional reaction rather than a reasoned argument. Yet the fact that it is simply an emotional reaction is not relevant to the bigot; he believes that since he believes it, it must be true. And that is good enough.   6)  Perceived loss of control over one's environment.  Someone who lives life in a manner quite different that oneself represents a threat to that individual. The threat is a threat to the ego in the sense that one's own choices may prove not to be optimal; it is also a subconscious threat to one's security in the sense that the other may prove to be more successful. This is yet another emotional, illogical response, but one that drives a homophobe to rail against those who do not share their heterosexual preference.   7)  Threat to one's own world view.  Very similar to point 6, above. When someone has held to the same ideas and has staunchly advocated them all of his life, someone else who says he's wrong can be rather threatening. A person who was raised (by the church, by the media, what have you) to believe that homosexuality is "unnatural, wrong, perverse, etc" and committed those values to heart endure very strong cognitive dissonance. "This is what I've been told and I've believed all my life, so therefore it must be right, otherwise what I've been taught is wrong." It's a very egotistical, self-centered, and arrogant way of thinking, but hey, when you're dealing with bigots, is that surprising at all?   That's what I've got for now. Maybe that will help shed some light to your query. There has been a lot of work done in the academic community about understanding homophobia and it's origins. If you're up to it, I would suggest cross-posting to r/lgbt or r/feminisms and ask their opinions.   EDIT: Hm, downvotes. Interesting. Por que?   EDIT 2: Forgot to add a"
TwoXChromosomes,"You didn't ask for my two cents, but I've wondered the same thing about myself for many years, and I do have one experience that clarified this for me.   When I lived in Bangladesh for most of a year, I'd notice that straight men would often walk hand-in-hand down the street. It wasn't sexual or romantic in any way, in fact, it was kind of a "bro" thing to do. As I made male friends of my own, I found I just couldn't feel comfy walking hand-in-hand with a man. It just seemed "off" . . . until I sort of got used to it. Near the end of my stretch in the country, it wasn't a big deal and I'd do it occasionally when I'd be walking with a Bangladeshi bro. To me, that made it clear that my previous level of discomfort was a conditioning thing that could be undone.   Now, when I feel grossed out by the thought of gay sex, I don't really sweat it. I see myself as engaged in a slow process of undoing my conditioning, and as long as I'm not lording my conditioning over someone else, it's not like I'm somehow evil because of it. I don't let on to my gay friends that it seems icky to me; I work at an easy pace to make it not seem icky. In fact, I think it's often much healthier to deal with the little biases we have than to pretend they're not there."

But if a sign is being given mentioning this sub and a welcome message is not up there, won't it seem that we are just asking for attention just for the sake of it?.. Just like you said, he did an AMA, so the existence of this sub it's not news, so we might as well take the opportunity to say something meaningful to him.

NASCAR,"I'm surprised this post isn't full of Tyler Walker haters. He's one of the most talented sprint car drivers I've ever seen race, and has always been super nice in the pits and hospital to the fans. It's a shame to see Tyler let drugs take hold and bring him to the position in life he's currently at. I've seen Tyler at his best, smoking a world of outlaws field, and I've seen Tyler at his worst, cussing and grabbing his crotch at the Williams grove officials. The kid had it all, he had a chance at NASCAR, he drove sprint cars for big names like kasey Kahne, and always had his talent in a sprint car to fall back on like when he ran 410s with the outlaws and around Pennsylvania for Keen Motorsports(which he won the Kings Royale at Eldora with...a $50,000 payday) and the Sorokach family. I really hope Tyler can overcome his addiction and get back to doing what he does best...wheeling a sprint car, I just hope he hasn't burnt all his bridges in the business where no team is willing to take another shot at him, because let's face it, there's drivers who don't abuse drugs and work just as hard and have the talent who many feel deserve that seat in a 410 PA or 360 NY sprint team. Either way I hope he can clean up off the drugs for himself and his family and get back to racing. The problem with Tyler is he's had and blown so many chances, only time will tell if he will find himself strapped into a race car in the future. I hope he does because outside of the drug use, he's one of the best drivers that will search for the fastest line and can hang a sprint car out slideways on the top."
NASCAR,"I used to race some small open wheel cars when I was younger, not karts but close. We had belts and a roll cage, and were always told to hold our hands on the wheel as to not risk breaking an arm or hand by the car rolling onto it.   One broken arm -and several months away from the track- later, I started letting go of the wheel. When you get hit on one of the front corners and it's a direct, mechanical linkage to your hands, there is a shitload of force transfered."
wilfred,"As in how long it takes or when it takes place?   I haven't seen anyone officially do one, but here's a rough look at the time frame, starting from Episode 1:   Season 1:  The first three episodes happen in under a week (if I'm not mistaken, Episode 3 acknowledges that Episode 1 was days previous. Episodes 4-11 don't have an exact time frame given, but can reasonable be assumed to follow a similar "week to week" basis as many shows strive for. Episodes 12 and 13 are essentially back to back, taking about a week, to a week and a half.   In total, Season 1 covers just over 2 months.   Season 2:  We open hearing that it's about four months since the end of Season 1, from Ryan's "time in the mental facility." There aren't any episodes that, time wise, lead directly into one another this season. Though, in Episode 4, we learn that Kristen is pregnant, and she delivers the baby in Episode 9, which means that the middle of Season 2 takes place over roughly 9 months (I forget if she was a month pregnant or not when she announced it, or if the baby was a few months early. I didn't think the baby was early).   Episodes 12 and 13 happen in fairly short order, and 10 and 11 have a reasonable space of time between them (whenever there's a "reasonable amount," it's generally assumed to be the following week. Could be a false assumption, but usually how TV works).   So with that, Season 2 covers roughly 11 months. Total time so far: 18 months, or a year and a half.   Season 3:  This season starts the following week, as proven by Ryan babysitting Wilfred while Jenna and Drew are on their honeymoon. Jenna and Drew coming back coming back the following week seems to lend credit to the idea that whenever a time difference isn't mentioned, a week between episodes should be assumed.   There are a number of filler episodes that could happen relatively concurrent to each other this season, but I'll continue to assume that, unless stated, there is a week between episodes. We know that episode 9 happens at Christmas, but we don't have any other specific date related episodes (that I can think of), so using this as a guidepost isn't incredibly helpful (I'm going off on a tangent here, sorry).   Without much from the show claiming the contrary, it can be assumed that Season 3 takes place over 13 weeks, or just over 3 months. Our total is up to 21 months.   Season 4:  We know that this season starts  during  the Season 3 finale, so again, no time break. The implication from episode to episode seems again to be that there is a week between episode. We've seen no indication that more time than we're aware of has passed, so by the end of the Season, 10 weeks, or just over 2 months, will have likely passed.   Grand total for the series: Roughly 24 months, or two years."

HIMYM,"You see, I don't see what has really changed though. After Stella he was sad definitely, and even got a little pathetic, but obviously understandably. I think Ted's pursuit of being a good teacher is wonderful and show's that he really isn't shallow. He's also well on his way to achieving his architectural dream. Ted's story has really taken a back seat to Robin, Barney, Lilli, and Marshall this season, all 4 of whom are going through major changes. During this time Teddy Westside has been a great friend (who could argue after last night?). So he's afraid of the changes in his group of friends, I don't think that makes him a bitch at all, I think that makes him normal. I mean, your two best friends in the world are starting a family, that will absolutely change your relationship with them.   The other thing that can be frustrating is when people hold Ted to different standards than other characters; because he is arguably the most dynamic character on the show (the show is after all based around the events of his life which allowed him to meet the mother of his children; Ted himself insists that the story of becoming the man he had to become in order to be the right man for their mother is important if not more important than the story of how they logistically meet). Because he changes so much, we expect more out of him. Established personalities get away with the flaws that we would complain about on Ted because we expect less of them, e.g. Ted is shallow for sleeping around and hooking up with people, but that's just what Barney does.   Now obviously the situation is more complicated than that, but you see what I'm getting at. I'm glad to see all 5 characters truly evolving now, as we've gotten more into Barney's and Robin's pasts.   The only thing that  does  piss me off about him is his complacency; his belief that his woman will magically come upon him and everything will be perfect."
HIMYM,"I agree with you to an extent about Ted not really changing, but I find this to be a bad thing. He is slightly changing, as any character should and we are even told at the beginning of the series that he had to change in order to be the man his wife would marry. However, the only way I can see him changing is that he keeps becoming more and more of a weak personality who continues to leech off of his friends. I honestly cannot see him being "worthy" of any real woman at this point as he treats every woman he meets as either "the one" or finds something wrong with them.   I also have issues with his supposed moral code. Ted is suppose to be the hero of the story but he continues to do things that are on the same moral level as Barney. He cheats on Victoria in season one and then in the current season he hits on and then eventually kisses her despite knowing that she has a boyfriend who she is in love with.   All in all Ted has never been my favorite character but I really cannot give you a real concrete example other then the fact that we are suppose to root for him and I simply cannot bring myself to do that."
HIMYM,"I really respect and would like to reciprocate the qualification that this is all only opinion!   I see your point about the cheating, my take on that is that Ted's heart, though fickle at times, is the commanding force behind all of his decisions. When he cheated on Victoria with Robin, it was because he truly thought Robin was the one and the girl of his dreams. When it comes to such huge potentials and moments of passion, Ted doesn't hold back, which you could see as childish or brave. Maybe childishly-brave, or bravely-childish.   I mean, you could look at that event one of two ways:   1) Ted wants to get laid, Robin is hot and into him. He tries to get some and gets caught by his long-distance lover.   2) Ted, in a moment of passion and regret for starting a long distance relationship which he knew from the start was a child of his and Victoria's emotional weakness and denial, does not want to miss the opportunity to finally be with an amazing girl who he fully believes could be the only woman for him (in that moment).   I find scenario 2 much more likely, but no matter which way you look at it, Ted was being a jerk,  BUT  he admits it! and tries to make it better.   This was in season 1, however I think the moment with Victoria in this season could be seen in a similar way:   Ted bears the guilt of that night all the way to Season 7, and when given a chance at redemption, he is jubilant and jumps on it. When he begins to realize that that whole guilt complex was very different than how he thought it had been, he is confused. This furthers his sense of wonder in what could have been. He is also jealous frustrated, seeing yet another character from his past happily married and in just the situation he dreams for. In this melting pot of confusion his passions consume him and he kisses Victoria, Victoria's confusion mirroring his own. But in that moment both of them get answers; Victoria realizes that she is exactly where she is meant to be, and Ted gets closure on another one of his failed relationship, and (in a strange way) some hope that he has not missed his chance."
HIMYM,"Just a side note: I loved Victoria."
HIMYM,"I'll try to come up with some specifics that show early on Ted rocking out more than current Ted:   In season 1, Ted skipped the date with his perfect match because he thought Robin was something special, he had strong interests in her and her personality. She matched his checklist perfectly (the loving dogs, quoting Ghostbusters thing, etc.) although he had to work insanely hard to win her over.   With season 3 being the turning point of his awesomeness in my argument, recently, Ted had 2 incidents where he skipped over a chance at his perfect girl. He was comparing two, which he wanted to go out with, and was going to sacrifice one who seemed almost flawless for him for a girl who had nothing in common with him purely because she reached for the check. The other one I can think of is back in season 5, where Barney had the phone that girls called non-stop because he held his number up at the Super Bowl. In their last ditch effort to find Ted a wife, Marshall and Lily found a girl that was a great fit for a lot of what Ted was looking for, but the phone forced him to follow Barney's footsteps into avoiding a girl if a hotter one is out there."

HIMYM,"I have a pretty close group of friends that could be casually compared to this show and these intro pics are the exact reason why I've been taking a LOT more photos of us hanging out. Basically 2007-2010 don't exist because we have great memories and maybe 6 pictures."
HIMYM,"This is...difficult. Eye colour is one of the few human traits that's close to being a single-gene trait ( most  of the information comes from one gene) but it's not fully there - it's still not all that well understood, but there's something like a dozen genes implicated. Punnett squares are well beyond their realm of helpfulness here (a trihybrid Punnett has 64 squares - I'm not sure, but I think I dodecahybrid would have well over 1000.) It could be a new, dominant germline mutation, but for the same one to happen twice is astronomically unlikely. My best explanation is that Ted's kids are examples of non-[complementation]( Basically - it's possible, but it's pretty unlikely.   I study genetics, so it doesn't bother me too much any more (our answer to most questions is 'it's probably possible') but since most people's understanding of genetics doesn't go beyond the Punnett square, I do sort of wish TV shows would abide by the rules of them. Totally understand why they don't, though."

TheoryOfReddit,"I think that's kinda an overreaction... We have a lot of people in the military here in the US, and I imagine a portion of reddit is actually US Military. I know a good friend of mine who is in the marines uses reddit all the time to keep up with news and see cute pictures. Furthermore, the United States really does like respecting and supporting our troops overseas.   I think posting pictures of deployed or returning troops is pretty far from pro-military propaganda. As far as I can tell, it's just feel-good stuff that strikes a sentimental note for people who have friends and relatives deployed. I'm against war, but I sure as hell support our guys who are fighting it. They're human and need outlets like reddit and cute puppies. I am happy to upvote a post about a veteran coming home to his dog, etc. I find it sweet, heartwarming, and touching. It helps me remember that my friends and relatives who are overseas will be coming home eventually.   It doesn't make me, or anyone else pro-war. It might make us less anti-troop. But if that's the goal, is it really that nefarious?   I think most redditors agree that war is bad, but does that have to imply to our troops being bad?"
TheoryOfReddit,"As a Republican on Reddit, I can say this is a pretty solid explanation.

GoNets,"You can get tickets to the 10/12 preseason game on StubHub.com; it is a resale site where you can often get prices cheaper than the official ticket seller.  You said you found some there; that's where I bought almost all of the tickets for games I went to.  Just sign up and buy a ticket and print it out; right now tickets are as low as $12.50.  Pick a ticket that says "instant download" and you'll be able to print your ticket right out (it has a bar code they'll scan at the arena).   Barclays was built in a very small area, and so it doesn't sprawl out like MSG; even the "cheap seats - the "nosebleeds" - are pretty good seats, as they are practically on top of the court.  If you have a fear of heights its a little daunting (my brother kind of freaked out at a game), but there isn't really a bad seat in the house in my opinion, and I've went to about 15 games last season.  There are some bad seats that have obstructed views in the upper sections directly behind the baskets; the rear rows of section 201, 231, 215, and 217 have obstructions.  Avoid those.   My favorite cheap sections are the corners, specifically 203, 204, 212, 229, 228, 220, 219.  Getting a low row on there puts you a smidge closer to the action than the rest of the upper sections.  Then again, if you want to spend to get something on the floor, go for it=)  Some of the seats (they'll be marked on the site) come with all-you-can-eat food, which gives you access to a special buffet in the arena (awesome) and also lets you get free unlimited food from every single food vendor in the place (no, seriously; its like a gluttony special).  Since you're willing to spend up to $60, right now my recommendation is the seat I'm seeing available in the FIRST ROW of section 228; it's $30, and with tax and stuff will be a little bit more.  I think you'll be very pleased with that area, but if not there, just grab the lowest # row you can in the sections I listed.   If you'll be near Times Square, I recommend walking to 7th Avenue (Avenues and 49th Street and take the  N TRAIN  downtown; it is an express train and in 20 minutes you'll arrive, without having to change trains, at the Altantic Avenue/Barclay Center station.  Walk right up the stairs and you are right there at the arena.   My recommendation for food/drink is a bar called  CYPRUS AVENUE  that is a few blocks (maybe a 5 minute walk) away from the arena; check google maps for specifics.  It isn't huge or anything special, but they have a good and affordable beer selection, really good bar food (from various "slider" sandwiches to pub classics like bangers & mash), and really good service.  It isn't a landmark or anything, but its just a good place to get some food and drink after or before a game.  Brooklyn is actually  full  of really great cuisine now - the restaurants in the borough are booming and becoming nationally acclaimed - so if you want something a little more memorable, ask and I'll have a huge list of recommendations."
UKPersonalFinance,"Excellent input there. I would have thought my comment fell into the category of stating the obvious, but here goes.   Let's consider renting versus buying a modest property worth 拢100,000. That could be a studio flat down south or basic house up north.   First, renting. A property worth 拢100k would probably rent for about 拢650 per month. That is 拢7800 per year giving a yield of 7.8% which is quite reasonable. Yields of over 10% are possible in some areas:  Over the course of 5 years you would pay 拢39k in rent. So in the rental case your position after 5 years is -拢39000.   Now buying. Let's say you put down 拢5000 as a 5% deposit, borrow 拢20k 20% from the government help to buy scheme and take a mortgage for the remaining 拢75k 75%:  You can get a 5 year fixed rate mortgage at less than 3%:  So you've borrowed 拢95k at a rate of 3%. We'll say it's on an interest only basis to keep it simple. (You'd be better off with a repayment mortgage as the size of the loan would decrease over time). Each year you will pay 拢95k * 3% = 拢2850 on the mortgage. Over 5 years that is 拢14250.   To be conservative assume house prices are rising at 5% annually.  After year 1 the house is worth 拢105k, year 2 拢110250, Y3 拢115763, Y4 拢121551, Y5 拢127628. After 5 years the house is worth over 拢27k more than you paid for it.   By buying after 5 years you've gained 拢27k in value and made 拢14k in mortgage payments, so you are 拢13k up.   Renting, you were 拢39k down. That's 拢52,000 worse off than if you had bought. You might turn down 拢52k but I wouldn't."
paradoxplaza,"No there isn't for as far as I am aware, but there are some simple solutions to this:     If you own the game on steam (or add the victoria2.exe to steam) you can press shift+tab to open the steam overlay. this features a clock.     Alternatively you may press alt+tab or the windows button (assuming your keyboard has one of those) which will take you to your desktop which features a clock in the taskbar.     You can also run the game in windowed mode. Windowed mode is not natively in the game's settings and must be activated by changing the game's settings file. This file is located under your documents/Paradox Interactive/Victoria 2 in the settings.txt file. By default this file will have fullscreen set to off, simply change fullscreen from yes to no. While you are here you may also want to edit the game's resolution so it doesn't take up all of your screen and you are still able to see the clock. in the end it should look something like this:   gui=  {  language=l_english  }  graphics=  {  size=  {   x=XRES   y=YRES      }   refreshrate=60  fullscreen=no  shadows=yes   and so forth       XRES = horizontal resolution   YRES = vertical resolution   DON'T FORGET TO SAVE YOUR SETTINGS.TXT"

Ingress,"if i happen to run into other players, i may greet them. really depends on my mood.   that being said i was in a town on a trip, as i was destroying an enemy controlled portal, the current owner drove up. we greeted each other, i told him i was just passing thru, and that i was just trying to lvl up. he was super polite about it, which was great. after i had taken all his res down, i put up a full set of low level res right next to the portal. no point in being a dick or losing any high lvl equipment. said good bye, and was on my way.  i found out later that i had killed 4 or 5 of his portals that night and that he had been following me taking them back."
Ingress,"Replace 'Resonator' with 'Defense Crystal'   This made me laugh, I'm sorry but that is ridiculously stupid... No offense.

Why don't we just call it mana and ap xp...   I like the terminology the way it is, it's different and fits the ecosystem.   I have explained this have to dozens of people if not hundreds and I never have an issue with then understanding the terminology.

What would you have preferred them do? Just accept that you MIGHT be on the other team and listening in to any long term plans?  I get you are casual, I don't play as much as many in my city, but I have done some bigger events, and I would have been sad if we left someone in the chat we knew could be spying on us and that screwed up some big event.  Actually cancel that, not would be sad, WAS SAD.  We had a guy with two accounts mess up an event.  He was invited to a G+ group, and destroyed an event, and prevented someone from keeping their 90 achievement, due to intel he learned from it.

horror,"Oh no.  Not this.  This is the same stuff that gets drug out at the festivals every single year.  It's that attitude of "If you don't have a copy of "Nun Slaughter 4" then you aren't a fan and you shouldn't be here". Yes, there are some people whose taste is questionable on this sub.  There also will be people whose taste is questionable if you find the magical land of Horrorshire.  It's just the way people work.  Some folks are going to have different opinions than yours.  That's not a bad thing, it's just a thing.   I'm in my 30's and lived though what you consider the golden age of horror.  There was some great stuff.  There was also some terrible stuff...just like modern horror.  Just because it is older and came at a time of awakening for the genre doesn't automatically make it better.   I've been going to Fantastic Fest for the last few years and there is some really tip top stuff being made today, granted, a lot of it doesn't get any kind of mainstream attention, but it's out there.  Just because it is modern, doesn't automatically make it bad (House of the Devil for example and I thought...although nobody else here seemed to think so...that West's followup The Innkeepers was pretty great too...for different reasons though).   You also have to keep in mind that Reddit, being on the internet, is worldwide.  As a result you're going to have people on here who don't have easy access to, or awareness of, all of the great horror movies of the past and present.  The kid growing up in rural Nebraska whose only resource is First Lutheran Video Rental isn't going to be as informed, but by getting some of the more accessible things, they are heading down the path.  Instead of just dismissing someone as dumb for liking Paranormal Activity explain to them why it's easy, forgettable fluff and then suggest to them an alternative along the same lines that actually has some merit (unless that movie happens to be Thankskilling...if someone likes that movie, they simply don't understand the genre and you need to back away from that person while trying not to provoke them as they are more than likely a dumb animal in a human costume...I kid, I kid...kind of).   Remember, Reddit is user generated, so if we are able to spread the word and teach these folks to fish instead of giving them fish, then feasibly the quality of the sub will improve.  Leaving it will just put you somewhere that has even less posted than is already posted here and more than likely that community will suffer similar issues, just along a different spectrum, since it will also be populated with people who happen to have opinions.  Exodus will also simply aid in further weakening this sub.  It's lose-lose."
xxfitness,"i'm your size, and i also have motivation issues. i hate doing activities that feel unproductive (walking to nowhere, lifting weights that don't move something from one place to another). i've had the most success with taking classes - power yoga and martial arts. first, there's the schedule and the lost money/disappointed teacher and classmates if you don't go. second, i'm learning how to do something and the exercise is a side-effect. i found that kung fu was a gateway drug into other exercise, because i wouldn't go to the gym to lose weight, but i would totally go to the gym to do exercises that would help me deepen my stance or move faster. and really, anything that gets your muscles toned and gets you thinking about the way you hold your body is going to push you towards what you want. even something like belly dance, which isn't full of tiny stick people and is actually great for abs and arms and endurance."
xxfitness,"I think /r/bodyacceptance is best for you, but I will say this: Stop weighing yourself.   Make your goals about strength, or distance you can run, or something along those lines. Work towards tangible, medium-term fitness goals based around what you can achieve, rather than how you look or how much you weigh. You've done amazing things in getting your weight down but fitness should have you feeling wonderful, not feeling down in the dumps. Ban yourself from the scales or from the measuring tape and enjoy your fitness because  it makes you fit ."
xxfitness,"I am doing strength training, moderate cardio (running/bike riding), and monitoring calories in an effort to lose weight and eventually put on some nice muscle.  I use MyFitnessPal to track food and exercise.  When I report my cardio calories, MFP budgets extra calories for me to eat that day.  However, the same thing doesn't happen for strength training.  Why is that?  I work pretty hard at the gym and feel like I'm moving around almost as much as when I go walking."
xxfitness,"Cardio is a great way to burn a lot of calories so if you're struggling to stick to your deficit food-wise then it can be a very useful tool. However, lifting (or classes/exercises that are strength-training based) works to maintain muscle mass while losing fat, as does eating enough protein, otherwise the deficit you're on has a bigger chance of eating into your muscle for energy and you end up with the "skinny fat" look. So"
xxfitness,"Hey I just wanted to chime in because the same sort of thing happened to me at the end of April. I started working out March and was going strong through April, and really loving what I was doing.   Then at the end of April someone ran a red light and smashed into my car, spinning me around and causing me to hit the car next to me. My car was totalled, the car I hit was totalled and the car that hit me (which was a fucking truck while I was driving a Kia rio) was not in good shape.   Like you I was able to walk away from my car, and thank god so were my dogs who were sitting in the back seat. I have had no lasting injuries although we thought my hand might've been broken (xrays said I was fine though).   I took a week off from lifting at all, I was sore and woke up stiff and I was just so tired. When I finally went back my lifts weren't great and I found some new places I was sore. I started back slowly, instead of every day/every other day, I only went 2 or 3 times a week.   Then I got sick. I had a fever and sore throat which turned into a terrible cough. It wouldn't go away, the cough stuck around and stuck around. After a week started to go away, but I still couldn't do any strenuous activity without turning into some emphysema patient. Another week to week and a half later my cough finally went away and I could work out again.   I basically ended up taking all of May off, unless you count moving for a week as a workout lol. I finally started to get back at it in the last week or two. I've been getting antsy from not lifting heavy things and I finally got a new car (a badass Jeep ;) ) so things are starting to be semi-normal."
xxfitness,"Honestly, depending on your body comp 1200 isn't THAT significant of a cut.  I've gone 1000-1100/day when I was "cutting" instead of just losing.  There is no magic number, regardless of what the interwebz wants you to believe.  Its about what your body works with best.   If you just walk into the gym and start lifting heavy things, and only lift heavy things I think you're only getting a very small fraction of the workout you could be.  Cardio is incredibly important.  I'm not saying get on a treadmill and run mindlessly for 30 minutes, but you NEED to get your heart rate up.   Noob gains are the magical phase that beginners are bless with when their bodies have the ability to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.  If you're a year+ into this you are far past this, sorry.  You need to decide if you want to lose or gain, and mold your routine appropriately. It sounds like your goals should be targeted toward protecting the muscle you have and losing the fat.   When you say you've gained significantly, are you basing everything on weight alone?  Do you have measurements? Pictures? A body composition analysis? Whats your body fat%? Have you packed on pounds of muscle, or is it fat?   So you're low carb- what does that mean to you, exactly? You're strict, do you cheat at all, ever? Too much? Not enough? What are you using to fill 1500cal? How long have you done this? Is your body bored and in need of a change? Are you cooking your food or is it preprepared? Are you drinking enough water? Eating enough veggies? Eating too many fruits? Miscalculating calories?(These are all rhetorical and intended more as a thought exercise than needing to be answered.)"
xxfitness,"The "stall" was water weight because I was pushing myself harder than normal. It all fell off after the two weeks (I think I "lost" five lbs in three days at one point ") once my body got better at compensating. The same thing happens when I do really intense or long cardio."
xxfitness,"We have similar stats.  When I started strength training I felt the same way: I could see fat on my arms, thighs and love handles even though I was significantly under weight.   What I did, and what I suggest you try, is a lean bulk.  Initially, I just ate everything I could get my hands on and did some light lifting.  Over the past couple of months, I've switched up my program to include heavy lifts and leaned up my diet.  I immediately noticed a change in my body composition.  I have decreased my BF% while gaining weight and size and, best of all, I'm no longer seeing myself as skinny-fat."
Diablo3Barbarians,"Yes, I usually play with another WD, Monk, Crusader,DH or another Barb. Or to be more exact, I'm helping friends to gear up well. Anyway here is how it is:   You don't need to take risks with packs you don't like the look of, if you see firechains/electrified I wouldn't touch that with anything except your cota. Since you have friends that help it will offset your lack of damage contribution (minus the cota, which is rather significant with high CDR, it's like at 60% your downtime on cota is 16s, thats absurd considering how much damage they do). Anyway you can easily stunlock stuff and group up, the wizard can black hole and that increases the damage significantly. Strongarm bracers are additive for each person, so if you have them and slam into an enemy thats up to 30% damage for the party, if wizard throws black hole and has strongarms, that's another 30%. As you can see for clearing that's rather efficient. Wizards are also flexible since they can lay their dots all over the place and you just have to keep the enemies in the fire.   The only time this will backfire is electrified. If they hit more it means instant death for you.   Trick is group up enemies and do small stutter charges to do damage and keep them relatively in place. This also make's the wizard's job easier when applying the 6p firebird dot."
Vaping,"So I live in Upstate NY and the cape scene here is very limited...like we're just getting a Vape outlet in the area but it's a good 45 min from where I live...I AINT TRYIN TO DRIVE THAT FAR! Lucky enough Facebook came thru and I found a vape shop in the capital (Albany) and that's a good 10 min from my house which is do-able. They had a shit load of flavors available written on a chalkboard with a lot of different brands but I ended up getting a 15ml bottle of the Gummy cola by Cosmic Fog...it was okay, had to steep it for a few and it got better. I noticed my bottle was low by the 29th of January so I began searching reddit from some good sites to find juice and came across Vapewild.com . I thought the list at the vape shop was massive....GEEZ!!! well ended up picking out 4 flavors and when I finally got it today (came on Monday but we got Blasted in the Ass 馃挭 by this snow storm so it got postponed for me to pick up today) MAAAAAAN I was shocked two smell how good these cereal flavors smell but I noticed I got 2 other flavors as well...long story short...I will be ordering from them again 馃憤馃憣馃憤馃憣."
aviation,"Because it's absolutely ridiculous landing this jet.  This thing was point-designed to fly very very high.  EVERYTHING else was traded off for the sake of saving weight.  The flight controls might have light forces in one axis, very heavy forces in another (because to fix that would require hardware, which a weighs something, which reduces your max altitude...you see the logic). The U-2 doesn't take brand new Lts, fresh from flight school... It takes experienced pilots from all walks of Air Force life (as well as transitions from other services), and lets them try out.  If you show promise, you get a second flight; if not, you're sent packing.  If you are adapting quickly, you get a third.  If they think they'll be able to get you to solo, you may get picked up for the program.   The main wheel is a regular tire, and does the real work.  The rear wheel is more like a skateboard wheel... It's there because, well, bicycle is better than unicycle.  When you come in to land, you have a very narrow airspeed tolerance.  There's an AOA aural system, that gives you a tone in your helmet.  You have to listen, essentially, to see if you're on-speed, too fast, too slow.  Your desired touchdown is both wheels simultaneously, minimum rate of descent.  This is much harder than just landing both tricycle main gear simultaneously.  Landing main wheel first will cause the jet to bounce back in the air, but since the cg is aft of the main wheel, the tail keeps sinking, and you wind up airborne again, nose up... not comfortable.  If you have a high rate of descent that you try to salvage by getting a late flare, this will only exacerbate the nose-up bounce, potentially stalling you a few feet above the ground.  A tail wheel first landing can stress the tail, or cause porpoising between the gear.  That would also suck.  Chase gives you a good idea of your height (you can hear from the countdown if you're descending too quickly, and going to bounce it, or holding too long a few feet up, and going to stall).  He also works to talk both wheels onto deck at the same time (since you can't see them).   Once you've got both wheels on deck, you're riding an enormous bicycle to the next taxi offramp.  You can't stop in the runway, because when you do, the jet is going to pick a wing, and lean over on it.  So you keep your speed up, and try to keep the wings from dipping while you cruise along at highway speed.   The wings are long as hell, so what looks like a slight lean in the cockpit looks like a drunken wing drop to chase.  He helps you out with that.  You spend that time popping the yoke left and right to get the roll spoilers involved, keeping you as level as you can until you clear the runway.   This is a cool jet, but it should get your heart rate up in the landing pattern."

WGU,"My first term I did 18 CU. It was an OK amount but I could have done more but I was holding myself back. I'm in my second term now. It'll be two months at the end of this week and I've completed 19 CU already. So what changed?   Like I said I was holding myself back. I was obsessed the first term with being the perfect student. I studied for ONE objective assessment for weeks. I passed it with a 95% . . . the cut was 56%. DON'T DO THIS. While it's great I did so well it was a general ed class that has nothing to do with my degree. I effectively wasted an entire month on a 3 CU class that didn't actually apply knowledge to my degree. OP's advice about objective assessments is spot on. That's how I started doing them and was able to blow through so many this term. Study what the reports says to. You can click the links in the report and it'll take you right to those sections in the course as well. If a class as quizzes take the hell out of those quizzes. They generally do very well to prep you for the final.   As far as performance assessments go here is how I tend to do them. After I get into the class I immediately e-mail the class mentor and ask for advice or any outlines to follow when doing the tasks. So far I've had every single mentor give me an outline to follow for the tasks. This helps greatly in terms of formatting your paper and making sure you include everything in the rubric. Following these outlines I've never once had a task rejected. This SAVES SO MUCH TIME. Rejection can add a week or more to the course, passing the first time can add up over the long term. I also always have multiple tasks in task stream. So if a class as five tasks I will submit one and start working on the next one right away. Often I'm done with task 2 before task 1 is even graded. This way you aren't sitting around waiting for the paper to come back. If you finish all the tasks MOVE on to the next course. No need to wait a week and do nothing. Again a week here a week there sure adds up in the long term. When doing performance assessments I tend to use google and the school library a lot. I often will finish a task without even going through the course. Or I only look at the pertinent information in the course for each task at a time. Focus on one task and do it before reading up on the next one. I find this helps me to focus. Also if you do get stuck on a task skip it and go to the next one. Tasksteam doesn't care in what order you submit stuff. Sometimes working backwards can help you solve writers block for one task.   Last piece of advice: Objective Assessments are super easy for me. I could literally just got down the list and do all the ones I have left in one term. However that would leave me with all performance assessments left and those take a bit of time. I like to switch off every other course. So I do an objective and then a performance assessment. This helps for me to keep things different. I hate having to do two performance assessments in a row. Remember that your mentor is there to assist you. You can set your own AVV. I simply tell my mentor what class I'm going to do and he adds it next. I skip around in my degree plan all the time. I don't go in order. I like to do similar class one after the other so that the information from the previous one is still fresh and sometimes my degree plan isn't laid out like that. Don't be afraid to tell your mentor how YOU want to work. Do what's best for YOU as your mentor can only tell you whats worked with other people. Everyone is different and finding out how I work best has let me do as many CU in two months as I did for the first six and I don't feel like I'm working as hard either."
orangeisthenewblack,"Haha I can tell it does. I think we'll just have to agree to disagree on this one because I don't think text is going to get my argument across well without me seeming like an asshole.   Oh I'm not sure if you've watched onwards but Ep5 features full frontal female nudity as well so I'd have to say that as far as I've watched they've at least been even in so far as stupid sexual scenes."
orangeisthenewblack,"that's like saying in the wire they should have had more white guys randomly get shot because a vast majority of the dead characters were black. it's not about the dead characters, it's about the fact that black people were far more represented in the wire because of the story...   also, the reason shows do female shock nudity is because of the networks like abc and nbc and showtime etc, where breasts arent considered bad but vagina is and thus penis is too. it only makes sense.   i just dont see how this can be considered a good thing. the fact they're going out of their way to incorporate male nudity in a female-based show just for equal representation of nudity is downright absurd, but that's not the end, no, they've gone even further and now there's more male nudity in a female show than female nudity! Maybe not more as in quantity, but more as in quality (as in we've seen dicks and balls, but no vagina etc)"

pettyrevenge,"Reminds me of yesterday when I went to catch Skyfall with my family. Before the movie started I was really excited because of all the good reviews I read. My heart sank when a couple moved into the seats behind me carrying a kid estimated at about 2 years old.   My prediction came true when the movie started and the kid just wouldn't stop making noises. It was distracting even at parts when the movie had no conversations. What pissed me off was that the parents wouldn't keep their kid quiet. Not even a shhh at him. Only when the kid was obnoxiously loud did they ask him to shut up.   To the revenge part. An idea came to me to condition the parents. I'm a pretty tall dude so I do my best to slouch in cinemas. So,whenever that kid make a sound,I sat up straight. As straight as I could. When the kid was quiet I went back to slouching. Soon the parents picked it up and as soon as I sat up they tried to keep him quiet."

We speak no Czech, but these two enormous meat-head looking Czech dudes spoke fluent German and some English. Turns out these guys are twins, and they're aspiring professional wrestlers. University educated guys, but they want to make it big in the WWE or whatever. Looking at them, I could see success in their plans. They were seriously ripped dudes.   So we're chatting in German, I can barely keep up with the conversation. My buddy would whisper English translations if I looked lost. Suddenly, I hear a loud American voice. At a distant table, some long-haired hippie looking douchebag starts yelling at his GF (in English). "Oh, yeah? Well why don't you just go up to those two meatheads and offer them blowjobs then, you whore? Huh? If you want to fuck them so bad just go ahead and do it!"   The girl had her head down, starting to cry.   I looked at my buddy. He looked at me. We looked at the Czech twins. They looked at us. We all understood 100% what this asshole was saying. And he didn't stop. His torrent of abuse just went on and on. The girl was sobbing at this point. We had had enough.   The Czech twins got up first. They walked to the douchebag's table and spoke in fairly decent English: "Excuse me, ma'am, is this man bothering you? Do you need any assistance?"   She just buried her face in her hands. But Mr. Douchebag shrunk to the size of a rat, which suited him. As the Czech twins stood over the table, I quietly agreed with my Austrian friend to intervene as well. I offered in perfect American English, "Ma'am, if you need help, we have plenty of money. We can get you home if you want to go home. America, Canada, whatever. Seriously. We can help."   She shook her head "no", and went back to sulking.   The Czech twins sauntered back to the bar and we went back to discussing the "dumme Arschloch" in German. Within a minute the couple left.   If you could have seen that weasel's face when those two Czech behemoths walked up to his table...it was a thing of beauty.   And yes, my Austrian pal and I would have split her travel fare home. We're not super rich, but we could easily afford airfare for a damsel in distress, especially if it meant freedom from the dumme Arschloch."
pettyrevenge,"Speak comfortably? Right now, two: Japanese and English.   Brief language history:     Swedish-German grandma only spoke mixed-up Swe-Deutsch to me until ~12     mother spoke French, her mom &amp; relatives spoke Italian. Read all my mom's French books     Four years Spanish in high school     during HS had a thing for exchange students: a German, an Argentine, and a Spainard (though the Argentine was a cheater and wasn't with me all year lol). Lots of conversation practice     one year each of Russian, Italian, French and German in university     18-month intensive Chinese Mandarin course, lived in Taiwan several months, spent a total of several months on the mainland     came to Japan as a tourist during a break from work, thought the language was similar to Chinese, studied in coffeeshops for four months     interviewed and got a job in Japanese. Worked in primarily-Japanese environments for ~ a decade       Now?   I know a bunch of phrases and can understand much of French. No confidence speaking.   Know the Italian names of all types of pasta   Remember remembering speaking German with a weird Swedish-isch accent   Understand standard Mandarin, can read subway signs and most menus   Keeping them straight? Lol nope. When I try to speak French it comes out with a bunch of Spanish words and false friends from English. When I try mandarin these days I end up with Japanese words mixed in. My Italian is basically my Spanish with a bad fake accent.   Speak only English and Japanese with any fluency. When I have time to sit down an write though, I can usually get my point across in French and Chinese.   I had business correspondence with someone in France last year. We had four or five exchanges until she wrote back in English saying "I really appreciate the effort, and though I understand you perfectly maybe English is easier for you, so let's use it going forward.""
JamesBond,"It's always a challenge to an important turning point like that: why didn't they just do it some other way?   As a writer, you try to make it feel as though the characters feel their action is naturally the best thing for them to do or the thing they are compelled to do or the situation dictates this is the only thing they can do.   NOTE: All the rest of my comment are spoilers.   Here you have three characters making a tight decision under duress. Bond, M and Eve. I believe thematically, this moment comes down to whether M trusts Bond to get the job done or not.   Eve is in position to take the shot but she abdicates her decision to M. She doesn't have the confidence to make this decision on her own. Her decision becomes: will she follow M's order to shoot if told to? It is almost a foregone conclusion as to what she will do as she has already placed control in M's hands. For her not to follow M's orders to shoot would be for her to choose her own course and she is just a cog on the wheel, not her own person like Bond.   Bond can hear what is going on in the ear piece, he knows the shot is set up. His decision is to keep fighting or try to duck out of the way so Eve has a clear shot. Bond keeps fighting because he believes in himself. He believes it is better for him to get the job done than to rely on someone else. If he thought it would be better to duck out of the way and let Eve take the shot he would have done it. Turns out he was right, Eve misses the bad guy entirely.   M is the one who has the fulcrum decision as her opportunity to have Eve take the shot has a very short shelf life. The choice is this: should she rely on Eve's marksmanship to take out the bad guy or on Bond's ability to beat the guy in hand-to-hand combat?   M chooses wrong, not because Bond gets hit, but because Eve misses the bad guy altogether and he gets away. M's choice to believe Eve had a better chance than Bond to get the job done was a bad choice. When she chooses this, she symbolically kills Bond with her lack of confidence in him. She spends the rest of the movie thematically making this up to Bond.   Bond "dies" and his self-confidence is destroyed for a time. We see him aimless, drunk and shiftless wandering through booze and women and not giving a damn if he dies. He has no purpose.   When MI6 is attacked Bond comes back because he believes he is the best guy to save the organization. Now he has a purpose. He is reborn and will show M he has what it takes to get the job done. The film has a motif on the value of self-confidence running though it and that is what helps to inform many of the plot turning points."
oneplus,"You know, this invite system had created quite a few thirsty people in this world, me being one of them. I believe that by getting this phone, the thirst will end, resulting in a feeling of euphoria and bliss that one can only experience when dying or masturbating whilst suffocating themselves on a doorknob. If one of you have already felt any of these, I am honestly jealous of you and I will try my best to become like you. All I ask of you is to upvote this so that a poor child like me from Uganda and feel the bliss that is the OPO and so that I can contact some rich oil magnate to give me the black gold so I can help my family live in prosperity.   However, until then, I will remain an inconspicuous, small, worthless African entity whose heart is as big as a Baobab but who's life is worse than Marmite."
oneplus,"Hey,   Just got my tempered glass protector.  Installation was super simple and although you could use the hinge method, I think it's easier to just hold from the edges and drop onto the phone from one end to another (top to bottom or bottom to top).   Part of the reason I had used the hinge method in the past is because screen protectors (the thin plastic film kind that are like a buck) are flimsy.  A tempered glass protector is different in that it's stiff."
bourbon,"So I have been looking for anything from the BTAC for well over a month now, adding my name to lists, hitting up friends in other towns.   Nothing.   This weekend I went back to my old university to see some college friends. Got there a little early and decided to go my favorite liquor store.  When I was in school, this is the only place I went. Basically it ended in me knowing all the staff and obviously the owners.   So I walk in and boom, all five bottles, gleaming in the light. Some of them were still wrapped, no price tags. So obviously I want all of them, but decide to be good and get Stagg and Weller because they were on the top of my list.   I got to ring up, Stagg: 77.99, Weller: 23.99. Uh oh. They rang up the Weller as WL Weller 12 rather than the BTAC Weller. I felt bad not saying anything, so I ask for Frank (the owner). I explain the situation to him. He had at 5 Wellers still on the shelf. He says "well, you just saved me a lot of money. rather than losing all that, i want to give you both of these for 100".   My jaw dropped. Just goes to show, treat your local shop owners well, bring them business, and be honest. A little compassion goes a long way sometimes folks.   Made my weekend to say the least."
Foodforthought,"The connection between banks and nuclear reactors is not obvious to most bankers but to engineers, psychologists and even sociologists 鈥?the connection is obvious.   A system that is both complex and 鈥渢ightly coupled鈥?has dangerous potential as small changes to the system can have dramatic and unforeseen consequences. In these tightly controlled systems once reactions are started they can be difficult to stop.   Many people would say that to make a system safer you should add safety measures but this can in fact make a system more prone to failure by adding in "failure points" or unexpected ways for a system to go wrong.   The residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)were financial safety systems that offered exciting new ways to blow things up. The repackaged mortgages, especially when the repackaging was repeated several times, made the behavior of the risks as incomprehensible as a malfunctioning nuclear reactor.   The pessimistic theory of 鈥渘ormal accidents鈥?says any sufficiently complex, tightly coupled system will fail sooner or later and that all you can do is simplify the system, decouple it, or reduce the consequences of failure.   Human error by regulators during the financial crisis failed to uncouple the failing financial system as, like engineers looking at the wrong screen during a meltdown, they received contradictory or inadequate information and so failed to realize what was happening until it was too late to avert the crisis."
brasil,"Depende. No contexto original, grego, oprimir minorias 茅 sim democr谩tico. N茫o a toa Plat茫o e Arist贸teles fazem as cr铆ticas que fizeram a democracia.   Na democracia moderna, que chamamos "representativa", constitui-se uma carta de direitos fundamentais do homem (que pode ou pode n茫o ser opressora), que n茫o podem ser violados sequer por uma maioria em congresso. Al茅m disso, um dos princ铆pios da democracia representativa 茅 a "isegoria", ou seja, que o n煤mero diminu铆do de pessoas com poder pol铆tico fa莽a com que mesmo uma 煤nica pessoa de opini茫o divergente tenha espa莽o para ser ouvida e defender a sua posi莽茫o.   No final das contas, no entanto, uma maioria ativa oprime qualquer minoria, ativa ou inativa. Se o povo brasileiro decidir que ind铆gena tem que ser exterminado, os ind铆genas o ser茫o. O que o governo representativo faz 茅 agir como impeditivo - primeiro por dar espa莽o de fala a representa莽玫es opostas a opress茫o de minorias e segundo por concentrar o poder em atores que s茫o escolhidos por serem "excepcionais", ou seja, que seriam mais pol铆ticos que a popula莽茫o em geral e por isso tomariam melhores decis玫es do que a popula莽茫o geral em democracia direta.   O que define ditadura e n茫o-ditadura n茫o 茅 exatamente o apoio popular, e sim a conformidade com o Estado de direito (todo cidad茫o recebe o mesmo tratamento perante o Estado, e o Estado n茫o pode violar esses direitos estabelecidos). Ou seja, a ditadura militar 茅 ditadura n茫o s贸 por n茫o ter governo diretamente eleito mas por fazer julgamentos arbitr谩rios, em inconformidade com a lei e com a legitimidade conferida ao sistema e seus tribunais.   Em resumo: depende. Depende do que voc锚 quer dizer com democracia. O linguajar pol铆tico, assim como a l铆ngua em geral, est谩 em constante transforma莽茫o, e a apropria莽茫o de termos se relaciona aos grupos pol铆ticos hegem么nicos do per铆odo. Assim, no in铆cio do s茅culo passado, era discurso pol铆tico razo谩vel trocar "independ锚ncia" por "coletividade". Atualmente, nem mesmo o Psol, de carta socialista, cogita deixar "liberdade" de fora de seu programa pol铆tico (da铆 o nome: socialismo e liberdade).   Ou seja, o sistema n茫o precisa ser un芒nime pra ser democr谩tico, j谩 as regras da democracia variam. Outra forma de an谩lise na ci锚ncia pol铆tica determina "n铆veis de democratiza莽茫o" (Chama-se Polity IV) de acordo com alguns crit茅rios como governo diretamente eleito, m铆dia livre e oposi莽茫o presente. J谩 alguns autores (notadamente Dahl) usam s贸 dois conceitos: participa莽茫o e contesta莽茫o. Os pa铆ses s茫o mais democr谩ticos conforme maior participa莽茫o e presen莽a de contesta莽茫o."

Cardiff,"No idea about their podcast (doesn't seem to be any episodes available atm either), but it's a shit club night that leaves a bit of a bad taste for quite a few people.   Backroom was an absolutely incredible club night that started in the vaults of the old Natwest bank down the bay. Mostly (actual) deep house and techno, they were booking world class DJs every month there, and it was all pretty much word of mouth to start with so was always a great crowd. The venue was amazing and was just left as it was, a pretty much pitch black bank vault. Eventually it got incredibly popular (and lost a bit of its charm as the crowds were just people who were there 'cause they'd heard it was cool, but was still good). For whatever reason they had to leave the vaults, and they moved to the old furniture shop on Trade Street for bigger events. It's stopped now since most of the people involved moved to Berlin.   Cellar Door somehow managed to get use of the venue, which I and many people thought was great at first because even if it wasn't Backroom, at least a great venue would get used. It turned out to be a load of valleys people with absolutely no clue about what made Backroom great, just wanting to make some money off Backroom's reputation. They charge 拢15 entry but don't book any DJs, instead having locals play shitty, shitty tech house (though I don't doubt they've moved on to playing "deep" house now). They've filled the thing with flashy lighting to make it look like a club in low-budget film (seriously a dark room was fine), and they even have themes/fancy dress. The crowd is as you'd imagine it.   Would be great to see someone putting decent stuff on in there again, but apparently the Cellar Door guys are charging 拢1k+ for venue hire (lol)"
Nationals,"You'll notice that Mondays and Thursdays are the most common off days for baseball teams. Most series are 3 games, and with most teams making sure they play all three weekend days, because no team wants to start a series on a Saturday or Sunday, that only leaves a few days during the week that work. Either you start on Monday and end Wednesday or start Tuesday and end Thursday. Every once in a while you get a 4 game series which fills out a week."
Browns,"Of the choices listed, I would go with Haden.  He has a track record for playing at a high level and seems to really love the city.  He has also spent his whole career here.   West seems to earning the favor of the coaching staff right now, but the running back committee seems to be volatile.  Tate is also a bit injury prone and always seems to be one hit away from missing 4 games.   Gordon was tremendous last season and can hopefully show consistent play when he comes back.  Unfortunately, he's one failed drug test away from an even longer suspension."
AtheistToChristian,"Well heck, nobody knows me here, I might as well tell the story.   I've been raised in a non-religious family; my dad lost his faith the same day he lost his brother to a motorcycle accident, and any proper faith my stepmother had was lost when her first husband broke her nose. Although she remains a Christian culturally (we are British, after all), I have no idea of the last time she read the Bible or had the Bible read to her, aside from my baptism. When I was younger, I used to have nightmares about dying, and the nothingness afterwards, and to this day I'm not sure whether I was scared more by the dreams I had, or the lack of assurance my parents could provide me on them.   Some context: in 2002, my dad lost his job (he was made redundant), and we were very, very hard up for money. Despite being only 6 years old, I can remember my grandparents coming over weekly with food hampers, like we were refugees, because our family, stubborn and prideful to a fault, refused to go to the food bank. Dad found a part-time job by the end of the year, and my dad and step-mother got married in the summer of 2003, with barely enough money to afford the ceremony and celebrations, which was at a secular registrar's office and a local restaurant, respectively.   Well, fast forward to the autumn of 2013; dad is accused falsely of theft by a manager who has a grudge against him (I can't go into details because that's a Reddit post in itself, but yeah, I know my dad, and his job; he's no thief), and is forced to resign. Once again, food hampers and little money was the order of the day. It can be difficult to think on days like today that I'm a University student, because a year ago, it looked like my family wouldn't have a house, let alone a son on the other side of the country doing an Undergrad degree in Politics.   Well, back to the testimony, now I was old enough to understand that this was a dire financial situation, I got pretty scared. My family has worked hard for generations, and despite not being University-educated, my male ancestors, my father included, have always been hands-on, intellectual mechanics and engineers. My dad could make work for himself to generate income, my older brother was able to find a weekend job, my step-mother started working two days a week at the village bakery. As a College Student at this point, with all of my time taken up by studying (and goofing around, because I was 17), I felt like I didn't have a niche. My family was staring bankruptcy and destitution in the face, and I felt like I could do nothing. Being a Godless Atheist at this point, I was already wrestling with mental questions on existence, and the philosophical ramifications of nothingness; feeling pointless in an emotional sense and worthless in a physical sense was not the most conducive arrangement for a teenager. Luckily, this manager was moved to a different department soon after, and 6 months later, my dad was back in work part time (as he is today) through one of the company's subsidiary recruitment agencies, but that is largely an undercurrent to the testimony.   It was an odd and totally un-Christian reason that brought me to Church. Trying to take my mind off of everything going on around me, I decided that I'd try to get back with one of my old flames, a very attractive girl who took me for granted oftentimes, not that I cared that that point. It turned out that she went on rare occasions to a youth group on Friday evenings at the local Baptist church, so I started going every Friday, in the hopes that I would see her there and... I don't know, flirt I guess. It makes me laugh now, to think that I've been going there since September 2013, and she was there on exactly two Fridays. So anyway, this youth club is run by the Minister of the church, who was my Padr茅 when I was in the local Detached Flight of the Air Training Corps (2531 represent!) when I was 13, and who also came into my primary school periodically to talk about God when I was younger. At the end of each Youth Club session of fun and games, there's an hour long discussion period where a Bible verse or two is alluded to, and discussion is held on it. About 90% of the people in the Youth Club are atheist, so this conversation never really goes anywhere. However, the first night I was there, something peaked my interest.   I don't remember the verse, or the discussion that was held on it, but I do remember that it suddenly popped into my mind that I got a copy of the Armed Forces New Testament & Psalms Bible when I was in the Air Training Corps. After youth Club, I dug it out, and started leafing through it. I was still pretty skeptical at this point, so I laughed at some of the verses and put it down. I kept going to Youth Club though, and I became close friends with the son and the daughter of one of the married couples who are both deacons at the church. I went every Friday evening, and I soon started going to the coffee mornings that the church holds one sunday every month too, but not to a proper church service. "They haven't got me just yet" I said to myself. That rhetoric of mine became increasingly false, though, as I read the Bible more, talked to my new Christian friends more, and started truly considering the prospect of an all-powerful, all-loving Abrahamic God.   I turned 18 in February 2014, and I decided to go to one proper church service, just to see what it was like. I dare say that was when 'they' well and truly got me, because I've missed exactly two church services since then, one because I was travelling, and another because I missed the bus for church once when I got to University. I fell in love with church; the hymns, the sermons, the Bible and how beautiful it is. I love how one book can be poetic, precise, universal, specific, informative and recreational all at once. I have fallen in love with the message of Christ, and because of it, I have met so many beautiful people. I went to the Soul Survivor youth festival in summer this year, and I made so many invaluable Christian friends there. When I got to University, I was shocked to find as many as five fellow Christians in my Politics course.   I was Baptised on the 31st August 2014, and I feel that my washing away of sin converged with the other big event of the day; bringing together people from my family life, my church life, and my social life, to show that I had chosen Christ, and that there was no turning back. The uncharacteristic complements from some people was staggering; my biological mother, who confesses believing the Bible to be nothing more than fiction, sat on the front row with me and smiled throughout the service; my father could not stop telling me how proud he was of me, and he gave me the strongest damn hug I have ever received; my best friend, who is a fanatical disciple of Richard Dawkins, sang all of the hymns passionately, and bought me a prayer cross as a present for the day. We had a massive shared lunch afterwards, and once we'd finished eating, I was still able to take two large trays of lasagna and pasta bake to my boss at work (I was able to pick up a job, working half the minimum wage at a cinema, because I was friends with the son of the manager), who was unable to attend because of the job.   I know that it appears that I've loaded this post with lots of apparently unnecessary information, but I feel that it is all relevant; my experiences have dictated my worldview, and I'll be honest, without those little pieces of information, I doubt that my testimony would have the full-roundedness I believe that it should have.   But yes, so, I'm now at University, with some good Christian friends. I've found myself a Church here, with which my only complaint is that I have to catch a bus at 9:40 AM to attend it. I now have two church families at home and University, and I now enjoy nothing more than talking about Christianity in philosophical and political terms (very useful when you have aspiring Christian politicians like me as friends). I'm relatively conservative in a British sense as a Christian, and I struggle with airy-fairy 'liberal' Christianity that many young Christians are like at the moment, but I can't fault them for how well-meaning and morally upright they are."
skateboarding,"I'll ride the downvote train with you, that scooter kid payed to ride just as much as the skater. Just because you dont like his choice of ride doesnt mean he is always at fault. This kid was going super slow, and heading into what looks like a mini ramp. The scooter kid could of easily of been in a middle of a run , you have no clue from the angle. Also the kid filming should of made sure it was clear and the kids knew he was coming that way."
Scams,"I have a relative who was almost scammed by these guys. He told me this story, and I am going to roughly retell it here as best as I can remember.  I wasn't there so it is complete hearsay, but he did end up having a very nice driveway when we did go to visit, when previously it was dirt and gravel.  It wasn't the greatest but it worked.   He had a very long driveway, gravel/dirt (about 300ft).  The guys show up, do a similar sales pitch as in the OP.  He authorized the work, they start up and do half the driveway before the truck runs out.  The boss sends everyone off to lunch and goes to talk to him. So in this instance it is different as it was a one on one and they did not gang up on him. The Boss claims the $3800 was for the truckload and it would be another $3800 to do the whole driveway and then even more to seal it.  He was furious.  He asked to look at the contract again, and then asked for the DL for the main boss so he could write a check.  The guy obliged and he took a photo of the front and back.  He then took a photo of the guy's work truck, as well as the asphalt truck. The boss asked what he was doing and he just smiled.  He then went inside and made a phone call.   From there he had a friend (who owns a PI firm) run a complete background check on the guy, got the name of his wife, his kids, grandkids, etc.  Turned out he lied about nearly everything. Even the address on his driver's license was not his real home, most likely a "business" address.   After obtaining all this information he went out on the porch, acting like he was on the phone talking somewhat loudly.  He was within earshot and he said something to the gist of "ya, you gonna be okay doing this for me? Ya, I know it is a big favor, but ya ya, i'll let you know by tonight. What? ya, I'm looking at him right now, oh, okay, will that help? sure thing."  He then says "just a sec" and drops the phone by his side and walks up to the Boss and takes his camera out and takes a few photos of him.  The boss is getting irritated and asked what that was all about.  He then says his friend asked for it as it will make things easier for him. He then goes on to say the following, roughly.   "oh, that is an old friend, and I'm going to give you the opportunity to finish this driveway for the $3,800 we agreed upon." The boss scoffs and tells him that is not what the contract says. "Ya ya, regardless, but that on the phone, my friend, he does special things, special favors, and I am going to give you a choice right now.  You can either seize the opportunity to finish my driveway and do it right, or my friend can pay a visit to you and <wifes name> and <childrens names> at <house address> and he's agreed to offering his unique negotiation services for the $3,800.  So either I pay you the $3,800 for finishing the driveway like we discussed, or my friend gets $3,800 for doing what he does best, family rate you know."   The boss then freaks out, threatens to call the police, says he is going to come back and mess him up, etc.  He then says "ya ya, all that is fine, do what you gotta do, but make your decision, if that driveway is not done by tonight, then I'll know what you decided and if that is the case then there will be nothing to stop what is coming. It is up to you and frankly I'd much rather just have my driveway completed and be done with it all."  He then puts the phone back up to his ear and says "Im back, ya, I told him, ya, uh huh, i'll let ya know. okay, okay, bye." and then hangs up while walking back to the house.   He then went inside and got a beer, and nervously peaked out the window.  The guy runs to his truck, gets in and leaves.  Then another guy comes by later, grabs the asphalt truck and drives it off.  He thinks "oh well, he called my bluff," and just figures he is now going to get sued for the $3,800 he has not yet paid them and expecting a visit from the cops. A while latter he hears noise outside and there they are finishing off the driveway. They worked into the late evening and some of the crew even came back the next day to make sure it was looking good. The Boss sent someone else to collect the $3,800 a couple days later and made sure to give him a copy of the contract/receipt with it written "Paid in Full" on it, with his signature."
falcons,"i see Maxwell's name brought up all the time and understandably so, but there's a Seahawk who we have a bigger need for that doesn't get as much love on here for whatever reason but that needs to change because who we really need is Malcolm Smith. from day 1 he'll be our best LB and paired next to Worrilow? wow the thought makes me giddy.

PhilosophyofScience,"This argument against emergentism largely misses the mark.   With such a physical set up, we should expect physical arrangement of the sheets to contain more water--the shape entails a volume, and the ability to hold more water is a necessary consequence of this arrangement--you could not create such a box that had the exact same characteristics and did  not  hold water.   With consciousness, not so. There is nothing about the physical brain that seems to necessitate consciousness, yet we have phenomenal experience. If one knew everything there was to know about the physical processes and patterns of brain activity, one would still have no reason to expect phenomenal content to be produced by the physical arrangement. Phenomenal experience is not a physically necessary consequence of the brain's structure, yet it phenomenal states certainly appear to consistently supervene on brain states. This is the phenomenon that emergentists (and, to a certain similar degree, epiphenomenalists) are discussing."
PhilosophyofScience,"My argument is for emergentism, not against it.   With the physical set up of the sheets (keep in mind, the brain is also a physical object), we would expect the amount of water they are able to hold together to be the sum of the amounts of water they can hold individually.  But this is not the case, the property emerges and generates a water holding value that is greater than the sum of the water holding value of the parts.   "There is nothing about the physical brain that seems to necessitate consciousness"  You don't know everything about the brain so you cannot validly make such a claim.  You also do not know everything about consciousness so you cannot make the claim.   "If one knew everything there was to know about the physical processes and patterns of brain activity, one would still have no reason to expect phenomenal content to be produced by the physical arrangement."  Again, you don't know all the processes and the patterns, so how can you claim that, with that knowledge, someone wouldn't expect to find phenomenal content?   What is the distinction between a physical structure holding water and a physical brain displaying the phenomenon of consciousness (seriously, I'm curious to hear your answer)?  They are the same in that neurons themselves aren't conscious, but when you get a bunch of them talking to each other, consciousness emerges from the physical neurons.  The neurons and the sheets are the same in that they both display emergent properties when appropriately configured."
coys,"Its unlikely, but not impossible. TV Revenue has got teams like Southampton spending 30m, and lewis could be expected to put up a decent amount even without that. Then theres the idea that you could spend to keep bale, and spend to get the jump this year when Arsenal & Utd -IMO the rivals for 3rd & 4th- have not spent (and utd may lose rooney and no longer have SAF). I also get the sense that lewis and levy really believe in AVB's 'project' getting results and that now is the time to invest, with great targets available at low prices."

fantasybaseball,"Wieters's numbers have declined as he moved up levels in the minors. Santana's either stayed the same or improved. The volume might be in Wieters's favor, but the trend definitely favors Santana. He's my pick for better offensive production this year  and  moving forward.   Wieters is hardly junk, of course, and if there's space to store him for later, do it. But how long will you wait? If minor league track records are all that matters, and you never move on, you end up playing Brandon Wood and Alex Gordon right now, who like Wieters were once the best hitters in the minor leagues, and everyone preached patience with them.

infp,"Exactly! I don't think it only applies to Chinese culture, it applies to the whole Asian culture, and by Asian I really do mean Asian. I'm Indonesian, it's a south east Asian country if you don't know it. In this country, people are literally only doing good deeds for saving their face. They didn't do it just for the good sake like what some of the western philanthropists do. I'm sick of these people around me trying to do good deeds in front of others and become really sick hypocrites when no one around. This whole 'eastern culture' really doesn't fit my personal value at all. I value a true, sincere good deeds, freedom, and I also believe that all baby born in this world really have terrific potential to be genius and whatsoever it is. However, sadly, we really waste all of those potentials by treating our child so badly. I don't like how my parents always prohibit me to do anything dangerous when I was a child, and then complaining why their kids are too timid, lack of initiative, and fearful to do anything. I mean, that's totally what you're trying to teach to your kids since they were born. I hate these people, who can only breeds, treating their child like they're their slaves and make them fulfill their ego and achieve something that they can't never do when they were a child. There are still tons and tons of stuffs that I don't really like about living in eastern hemisphere. Somehow, I wish I could switch places with all of those complaining xSTJs living in the west.   People in my country generally are nationalist to the point that it become chauvinistic. I believe in kindness and love toward humanity in general but these people are so selfish that all they really care is their own country. I mean, if you want your country to be helped, you have to help others too right? No wonder this country is fucked up. There are so many people here using their 'nationalism' for their own gain, like when they sell products, they would say 'this product is from Indonesia, so buy it'. And I'm like, WTF, that's totally against my values. So what if you were born accidentally with these people? That doesn't make you have to be responsible to do good things to these random people who mostly are fucked up people with bigger ego than Kanye West's ego. I agree with what John Lennon (he's INFP too, so...) and George Carlin about love and pride for your nationality.   >"Pride should be reserved for something you achieve or obtain on your own, not something that happens by accident of birth. Being Irish isn't a skill... it's a fucking genetic accident. You wouldn't say I'm proud to be 5'11"; I'm proud to have a pre-disposition for colon cancer.""
infp,"It was actually an eagle-headed man beast that broke through a window and attacked my friends. I wrestled him out the front door and threw him into the front pasture. There he turned into a dachshund and came back, looking thoroughly pitiful while telepathically apologizing to me. My waking mind can't believe my sleeping mind bought it."
CalmDiscussion,"I definitely do believe there's such thing as human superiority, since this is the backbone of the whole evolution theory. There's always a certain factor that has a better chance of survival within its environment, which could be intelligence, muscle strength, agility, etc., depending on that certain environment.   However, that doesn't mean one should purposely treat others in a negative fashion because they seem not to have specific outshining factors. There is a biological reason not to do this for humans. Mistreating your own superiority leads to a decrease of social status on which humans greatly depend, without significantly increasing most other factors. Mistreating others is psychologically experienced as negative behavior by most humans, making them disallow you to utilize them in a voluntary way."
homeautomation,"At first, I was pretty excited to see that you could get one through their developer program for $99 ([explained here]( because once I decide which system I'm going with, I'm certainly going to be developing my own plugins and I wouldn't mind making it available to other people for free since the company did me a solid by dropping the price.   That was until I saw their bullshit terms which basically amounts to "we demand high quality plugins delivered in a short timeframe in exchange for a trivial discount on our product".   Seriously, $150 is between 1 and 3 hours of professional developer time (depending on skill set), which is no where near enough time to learn their api AND develop a cool app.   Vera does seem to do a lot of extra things, which, if you're looking for that could justify the price, but all I want is hardware that I can control from unix (via compiled code, some known network protocol, etc) that will (wirelessly, securely?) allow me to control electrical outlets."
queen,"I went to the MSG show, and NJ shows at Izod and Atlantic City.  In order: #1. Atlantic City, #2 Izod, and #3 MSG. For the Atlantic City show I got to sit two rows back from the end of the cat walk, so that enhanced the experience.  But the whole band was so ON for that show and the audience was phenomenal which makes for the whole awesome package.  Izod center was a lot of fun too, especially the Spinal Tap moment right at the beginning with the curtain malfunction. :D They didn't miss a single beat though!  MSG was my very first time seeing any incarnation of Queen ever, and wasn't sure what to expect with Adam. I remember thinking at the end of the MSG show that he made you miss Freddie even more.  Once the initial "shock" wore off and I went to the next two shows, it kinda felt like Adam was in the band all along and not necessarily filling a vacancy. I know, it probably sounds sacrilegious but that's how I felt :D"
RandomActsOfPolish,"Omg, I love sharing these stories!  I was on a plane with my boyfriend and it was a evening flight, but still landed before 9, so we were talking to the guy next to us have a grand old time, when the woman in front of us gets up and says, "You guys are going to have to be a little quieter, you are talking way too loud and some of us up here are trying to read or sleep!". She was mostly talking to the guy we were sitting next to, he was from Louisiana and had a rather loud voice, but then she turned to my boyfriend and was like, "And  you  need to stop encouraging him!" I don't know what came over me but I was so mad that some random woman would talk to my man like that, only I'm allowed to be mean to him!  So I told her she needed to get back in her seat and shut her mouth.  The guy next to me started calling her a bitch though, and then called her ugly and SHIT JUST HIT THE FAN.  Arguing all over the place, then the flight attendant came and talked to us.  The best part was when we eventually made friends with everyone around us and started having way more conversations because everyone was on our side.  We won!"
RandomActsOfPolish,"YAY WATSONED!   Ok so let me tell you guys a little bit about Watsoned. She's awesome. I mean TRULY awesome.

And that cat is ohmygodsocute."
waiting_to_try,"I'm 26. I've had Baby Fever since around the time I graduated college in 2009. See, at the time, my boyfriend at the time (husband now), had been planning on getting married when I graduated. I had it all planned out. Married at 22, babies by 23. He had a great job with a bank and we were set.   In April, weeks before my birthday when I thought he was going to propose, his bank went under hostile takeover and his entire branch was laid off. I was crushed, but expected things to get back on track. He spent the next two years unemployed, and I waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Repeat ad nauseam.   We finally got back on our feet in 2011ish, got engaged in 2012, got married this past April. I've been in baby overdrive. I'm in graduate school; we're not financially stable - I quit working in June to finish up school on a full-time basis when I found out I was slated to graduate in May 2015 instead of August 2014 like I thought. Noooo thanks. So I'll be graduating in May 2014, but in the meantime, we're scraping by at sub-poverty income levels.   So yeah."
hiphopheads,"Wayne had no priors. And the article says Cory has none either.

hiphopheads,"Challenge them to go to 1 of his live shows. See If they don't have an appreciation for the guys passion. I've seen him open for usher to obviously now rocking stadiums. I remember at the glow in the dark tour feeling extremely inspired that an artist would go out of his way to ensure each guest left with a parting gift- the glow in the dark book. It really brought my appreciation for him to a new level. More recently at the watch the throne tour I had seats at the side stage, so when the show was over I can see them walk off backstage. Kanye literally stood in awe looking out to the crowd. The guys passion in my opinion, is unparalleled and I feel of the people you speak about saw him live just once, they'd at least understand that a little bit better rather than hate."
hiphopheads,"k- would a lot of men feel uncomfortable with their girlfriend/wife going and hanging out with a bunch of famous people on their tour bus/at the hotel all night? yes, absolutely. but some of the finer points of your statement don't make any sense and just sound like a jealous/insecure mind set.   1- I don't know why she has to sleep with them for it to be inappropriate. or why you'd automatically assume she banged the whole damn band. it's inappropriate because she put herself in a bad situation. just like most girls would be pissed off if their man went to some kind of swinger's sex party titty club extravaganza even if he kept his pants on all night.   2- I don't get why saying she had a "great time" means she slept with them. that's probably just insecurity/jealousy reading into it too much. see #1 again.   3- once again even if they DID just "talk" all night it's still sketchy and inappropriate to be at a hotel with a bunch of dudes you've never met before."
MotoX,"I have a bit of a background with android. After viewing the logs when I was hit with the issue, it seemed like the part of the image that deals with the radio (WiFi, Bluetooth, and wireless data) was either corrupt or missing. This was confirmed when performing a factory reset through the boot loader. The phone would boot, but anything related to the radio failed to function. Furthermore, installing the old radio made the phone fully functional as far as we could tell, and keep the lollipop update.   I decided to trade my phone in instead of using the patch as the boot loops may have damaged the battery. Lithium ion batteries do not like "extremes" meaning being too full or fully empty for too long can cause damage. The boot loop put my battery at 0% and I was unable to get it to charge properly afterwards."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,"Ah, the "good stuff", yes!   Reality is certainly having lots of fun lately, a jolly joke at the expense of its participants. I guess reality's biggest joke is that it is only made from the experience of it; there is nothing underneath. And that it isn't separate. This can be summarised in the idea that:     Experiences leave traces which  in-form  subsequent experiences.     Thoughts are experiences too, and so both shape and are shaped by the same process.     This can be summarised in [a diagram I keep meaning to do a better version of](     In other words, the "shape" of your apparent world corresponds to the "shape" of your mind.     There is no "outside" to this state of affairs.       It's tempting to think of this as a metaphor for the brain, but really we should see the brain as a "image in experience" of the mind. After all, you've never really experienced having a brain, have you? This is not a comment on your intelligence. ;-)   This also lead to  The Blanket Metaphor  for reality, where it's all just, well... shapes in a blanket, baby!"
compsci,"Noooooo. Reviewers should be anonymous. I totally agree with double-blind, but that depends on the technical competence of the committee.   Can you imagine what will happen the first time a disgruntled author attacks a reviewer, whether just or not? Nobody will ever volunteer to become a reviewer again!   Anonymous reviewers also improve the resulting quality. Otherwise authors will easily say "oh, this review isn't important because it's by X" and ignore all their feedback, even if it's valuable in the long run."

compsci,"Disclosure: I'm a software engineer at FactSet.  This is a throwaway account.   As far as I know there are no plans for a death march or layoffs nor do I see any indications of this.  FactSet has over 4000 employees so an increase of "hundreds" is still less than 10%.  I also think the "hundreds" statement is hyperbole (but I don't work in HR either).   There are a lot of projects here and typically each project will have a fairly small team.  I work on a team with 3 other programmers for example.  I haven't been working here very long, but this sort of structure isn't very conducive to company-wide death marches.   While financial software rarely gets people excited, working at FactSet is actually pretty nice.  We use a lot of different programming languages and a lot of different libraries (including open source libraries).  We use a good deal of "best practices" without going overboard - version control, code reviews, unit tests, etc."
drums,"As other people are saying, you should play them and pick the ones you like because beauty is in the eye (or ear in this case) of the beholder.   However, my opinion on the packs, even though i am inclined towards zildjian, that pack is not really well-suited for metal, whereas, the sabian pack is nearly made for metal. The Zildjian pack would be phenomenal for R&B, or Hip-Hop. But, the Sabian pack would be better for metal, in my opinion."
drums,"Ok I've but 2 tales from my current place of abode. 1st one to give you some insight to my neighbour on the east, it's not actual drumming but.... So one lovely (raining & 5c) winter saturday evening I was hosting a birthday party for 2 friends in my double garage which is tin. Now we didnt have the tunes too loud as it was cheesy drunken singalong stuff for the ladies but sure enough about 1030pm Police arrive. A mate lets me know, asks if he should turn it down & I say no, it's fine I'd like them to hear it. (Sat night time is 11pm for loud music etc) So the first cop comes up & asks if this is my plce, I say yes. He then much to my surprise rather sheepishly telss me he's had a call so they had to come. I ask but Sir, you can hear we've not turned down the music, it's not yet 11pm, what is the issue? Well he looks left, looks right, at his shoes & back to me & says, "Mate, it's not the music...it's the singing" To which all 15 of us that were there piss ourselves laughing, as do the boys in blue. I asked was it there with a nod of my head next door & he says yep. When we calm down this bloke actually apologises to us & wishes us a goodnight!   So that's the pratt next door right. Now another time, sunday form 2pm I had a mate round with his 60w Crate amp & my Tama kit. We were playing with the shed door down to minimise noise & when we come out for a break old mate's there waiting for us over the fence to have a spit. I try & be polite & point out that it's 2pm not 10pm & we can by law actually make as much noise as we want. His response was that the EPA have guidelines that say 40-45db for residential is the max & if we dont stop the police will be called. Well I got the shits about then & said "call em now & if they tell me to turn it off I will". Knowing the law as apposed to guidelines he didnt want a bar of it. So it went back & forth & he's wife played peacekeeper, my mate chooky got into him a bit too but we both agreed to try & be more considerate; although I cant think of how to be more considerate without ever playing again. Now a few weeks later for my bday I got a whole bunch of musos coming round so I decide to do the right thing & warn him the day before & I also had a $50 hoyts movie card for them to [use that arvo, bit of an olive branch you see? The folls are retired & I',m not a complete prick & you know what the cunt says when I offer it to him? "thats dissapointing we havew people over too cant you just not?" to which I basically said "mate im trying to be nice here, i'm not gonna stop drumming cos of you but if you wont work with me bad luck, enjoy the shop tommorrow" Again his mrs had to calm us down & I feel like a right cunt for not being more respectful to my elders but its my passion! & i pay a shitload of money to rent that house $415pw by myself so bfl. 6 odd months on I have jams twice a month on average I let my mate bring his Laney stack (300w) & play with the door oopen if its hot o I feel like it. We never play after dinner time 6pm 7 at the latest & only on weekends & public holidays, other neighbour on west are all muso's (very different to us) & encourage us, the chick across the street sits on her porch when I practice & even little kids will stop to listen if the doors up. Old mate tried to talk to me once a few months after bday party & I just said, :"nup, im not listening to your shite no more mate, i'm within the laws & my rights Ive tried to be nice you've been the opposite, so enjoy the mosh, bfl (bad fuckin luck)"
drums,"This might get a little long but here it goes:   I had an electric kit in an apartment, I was on the bottom floor (a partial basement on a concrete foundation) so I figured playing wouldn't cause to much of a ruckus.   I got my first complaint from the women above me, which was fine, I would just drum when she wasn't home. I knew what her car looked like so I could always check before practicing.   The next complaint was worse, I was not home and she had complained of hearing drumming below her (Must be a ghost drummer..?). My roommate called me and said that we had gotten a noise complaint and to stop drumming (He wasn't home either). I told him I wasn't home and that maybe it was someone else in the building listening to music or something. I had no problem owning up to the complaint when it was actually justified.   The next complaint was even worse. I received another drumming related noise complaint while I was not home and now the complex management was threatening evicting us if we got one more noise complaint (This was our 4th already. 1 from my roommate, 1 from me, 2 from ghost drumming). This women was fucking nuts as I would soon come to find out... I gave the women my phone number and told her to please call me or text me instead of calling the complex office.   I never received a call or text from her but suddenly the noise complaints stopped. This is the end of my worst noise complaint story here - so if that is all you wanted then stop reading. What follows is how I knew her claims were entirely unsubstantiated all along - with the exception of the first one.   Around this time my guests and I would routinely hear her shouting/screaming in her bathroom. Stuff like "Fuuuuuuuuhhhhcccckkkkk YOOOOOOUUUUUUUUU!!!!" and "I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck! I don't give a fuck!" for a half an hour to an hour at a time. Don't get me wrong here, it was hilarious and weird but I did feel bad for her. She seemed to be suffering with some mental problems and she had a young kid to raise all alone. We would also frequently hear her having the loudest most desperate sex imaginable... like unreasonably loud... at 2AM. I didn't give her a noise complaint because I'm not an asshole - but it was very loud on several occasions and I don't know how her son could have slept through it if he were there.   The whole thing came to a head one day when I and my two friends who lived across the hall from her stepped outside for a cigarette. We had heard her doing her usual screaming/shouting for a while and had decided to step out for a smoke rather than listen to it. When we stepped outside the entire lawn and walkway to the apartment building was littered with broken plates and other porcelain. We were dumbfounded when she came out from her apartment upstairs and down the stairs and asked us for a cigarette. We gave her one. She said, "Thank you. I think I will just sit here for a while..." and sat on the grass among the scattered plates.   I'm not usually one to ignore the elephant in the room so I say to my friend,  "A lot of broken plates out here huh? I wonder how they got here..." I wanted to see if she might own up to it but she didn't though it was obviously her. My friend grabbed the broom that is usually kept under the stairs by the maintenance people and began sweeping the walkway while we smoked and talked. She just watched this whole thing go down all wide eyed and loony, didn't help or say anything.   A week after this she either moved out or was evicted but we have never seen her again. And I still haven't had a noise complaint since.   Also, she was a milf."
drums,"If you have enough memory locks it's a non issue.   Granted, yes getting this initial set up does take a while, but once everything is where it needs to be, you dont need to take a lot apart (depending on method of travel)   For example back when I still had my pearl soundcheck (set up exactly the same but I had two 10" toms 12", then16") on a pearl Icon rack ; since we had a little covered trailer for gigs, I would just simply take off toms and cymbals, and leave tom and cymbal arms attached (I would 'tuck' some things to make it skinnier) and set it inbetween gear so it would fall. Come show time, I would find a corner to put toms and cymbals back on, then me and another person could take the rack with everything set up on stage so I would only have to fit my bass , snare and Floor tom into line"
BigBrother,"I agree that MVP would have been a great twist had it not been for Elissa being in the house (at least with out another person or few people of popularity, perhaps chicken george or maybe Ian, or one of Will, Dan or Mikes relatives.)The shows producers must have anticipated Elissa having a decisive advantage over the rest of the house right from the start. The way they made the rules around MVP she was guaranteed to have between a 25 and 50% say of the nominations every week (just for being related to Rachael) until the house is able to vote her out. I'm sure in future seasons they won't stack the deck how its happened this season, but as is, its ruining this seasons show imo."
NPSL,"Players I've seen play: Matt Brown, Russell Cicerone, and Luke Winter fully deserve their slots. Matt Brown is an undeniably talented player who scored a lot of goals for Lansing. Without him, they would not have won the GLW division. Cicerone was so nice, he had 6th City Syndicate raving about him. For Cleveland supporters to rave about the talent of a Buffalo player... you know he's pretty damn good. Winter was great for Chattanooga this year, and is no small part of their spot in the NAtional Championship game.   Goalkeepers, I watched Hartley play, but I never really know how to judge keepers properly.   And of course the player I have the most experience with is Josh Rogers. I don't think he was the single most talented player on our squad this year, but he's been ever-present at center back and is our captain. He also took our penalty kicks this year with a 100% success rate. At his position, he's certainly qualified to be in this team.   Fort Pitt's center back is the one that's a little baffling to me. Their defense didn't really impress me that much when we played them. They got absolutely sliced apart in the second half. Not sure if he was with the team that day or not though, since the game was in Detroit.   Others, I haven't seen, I wasn't able to watch the Chattanooga-Sacramento Gold game live and I didn't go back to watch it. But NYRB and Gold both won their region, so I assume they were fully deserved."
Metroid,"I also think that there wasn't complete closure on the survival of the X. I'm fairly sure with their power and potential that they could have survived an explosion like that, after all, the X had to coordinate with each other in one way or another in order to stay up on their game in trying to remove samus. I really would like to the see more about the X in the future because they definitely have untapped potential and it could allow for more character development from samus because she still has to adapt to being part-metroid. If the X were to have survived to explosion and escape from SR388(or have already existed outside of it due to somehow having the metroid as a predator which means that they would have to have encountered each other at some point), they would present a true threat to the galaxy and samus would be their one and only true hope. The idea of the X parasites coming back and going on the offensive could also make for a new trilogy(maybe this time with a final boss battle that isn't a big disappoint)"
resumes,"those words are simply how I write   It took me a long time to realize that when I wrote the way I spoke, people perceived it as condescending, flowery, and stuck-up. I didn't want to come across that way, so I began to consciously tone down and simplify my sentence structures and word choice."
hookah,"Permitting depends on where you are. I got an EIN, State sales permit, city permits for tobacco, non-intoxicating beverages, and vending. Besides that the big one for me was a wisconsin tobacco products distributor license. That allowed me to buy tobacco from other states and pay the proper taxes, but there are also distributors that may pay your state's applicable taxes. Again the permits you need will vary state to state so make sure to check your local laws. If you have a smoking ban in your state you may be SOL.   Expenses, the best I can from memory, were as follows: Realize I was trying to get this off as cheaply as possible and then spend more on it as I made it. You could definitely spend more on equipment and furniture, but I don't see the reason. If your clientele ends up being like mine they will just have somewhere cool to go and won't care if the couch is brand new designer, or second hand with a cover. This is rough estimations below. Also I was in a 1000+ sqft location that seated 25-35 to start furniture costs go up with more space :P     Stainless sink, fridge, and stainless work tables - (all used) ~2-3K   Couches, chairs, tables - (As much quality used as possible and filled in the gaps with some cheap new) ~ 2-3k   Cash register - (I now use an ipad with square and a cash drawer) 100-1000   Hookahs, supplies, & tobacco (for use and sale) ~ 2-3K   legal fees and permitting ~ 2k     Other stuff is any buildout or remodeling, paint, decorations, music apparatus, and depends on the state of the building you rent. I also rented an ice maker in the beginning rather than buying, but this is also something you can find relatively cheap used on CL. Finally you could avoid the fridge by instead buying or renting an old canned soda vending machine and using that. Also for music I contacted a local coin-op vender and 'rented' (they take 50% of the take) a jukebox and a dig dug machine and it cost me nothing up front. You also want to make sure you have enough squirreled away for the first few months of rent and bills and advertising. Hope this helps a bit."
hookah,"If you read the article and look at Figure 2 in the methods section.  They aren't even measuring the smoke you draw in.   >The tunnel captures the smoke coming off the head, dilutes it, and routes it into the 1 脳 1 脳1 m ageing chamber   The ageing chamber is where they are getting the smoke composition  from.  This article is just about worthless when it comes to the smoke you're inhaling.  As far as I know, the smoke I inhale aren't the fumes coming off of w/e quicklight they've decided to use."
TeenWolf,"This]( appears to be the article the one posted references.   The Holland interview they reference is  here  not returning is right around 55 seconds in. It's all very non-committal because unless it's her that's not returning for season 5, there is no way she would know at the time of the interview.   As for the suggestion that someone is coming back, I don't remember and can't find a source for that, unless it's the [IMDB page for 501]( which anyone with an account can edit to say whatever they want."
FantasyPL,"I don't know about that. I played around with it this afternoon and I think this looks OK. The midfield may be a little bit thin but it's definitely workable. Also if injuries or poor form beset them, it will be easy to downgrade them as needed. That scenario may cost a points hit in future, I accept that. Ignore the goalies for now, that's a work in progress.   FYI I'm left with 0.8 in this squad, so Sterling can be downgraded to Schneiderlin or Nolan and Ramsey can be retained."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,"Sorry but people aren't "meant to smell", he smells because of the things he eats. If you ever notice, certain ethnicities smell certain ways- it is because of their cultural food."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,"The chances of you being pregnant are pretty low.  You had sex about 8 weeks ago.  You then had one normal period and one light one.  Your body only produces an egg once a month (and it should at all if you are on the pill) if the egg was fertilised you can have some implantation bleeding which can appear as a light period.  However, given that you had a regular period then a light one it would be pretty hard to explain that by a pregnancy.  There are a LOT of different factors than can cause lighter or heavier than normal periods and being stressed or worried is definitely one of them.  As I understand it people that don't know that they are pregnant are generally overweight (as this can hide a bump) and/or people that don't get regular periods.  If your periods are normally regular and the only thing that's different is that one was lighter than usual, I really don't think you have any reason to be concerned at all.   Seeing as you seem to be quite anxious about this I would recommend taking another pregnancy test (assuming that it's been a couple of days since the last one) and go see a doctor.  They will probably give you a regular pregnancy test and then if for some reason you are still concerned they can do a blood test as well."
CombatFootage,"That Doc and a BBC one finished any faint hope i had for Afghanistan. It's another Vietnam. We need to leave.   [ The deeply depressing BBC report concerning the June 2010 audit published by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction on the $27B the US has spent, and apparently wasted, on training and supplies for the Afghan forces.  transcript can be read on link](   The auditor described the process as like funnel. A wide mouth being crammed with money at the US end and a narrow trickle of fuel, uniforms, guns and training at the Afghan Unit level. Value is siphoned off at every level.   She also asked to see the top rated Afghan police unit. This unit has had $M's spent on them and can stand on their own feet holding down a region of Afghanistan according to the unit ratings report. She was told that this area was out of US control and it was unsafe to go there without a major operation as the unit had possibly gone native.  That was rated the best unit in US army reports.   The relevant parts of the doc:   BBC:  The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction reports to the Congress, the Pentagon and the Secretary of State. One of the main failings highlighted in the most recent audit is that some of the Afghan army and police are extremely adept at pilfering equipment and essential supplies and selling them on for cash.The report鈥檚 author, Emily Rachman, in her firstbroadcast interview about her findings, points to a culture of routine dishonesty.   RACHMAN: During our work we discovered that the supplies were not reaching their intended recipients. Sometimes partial shipments made it to the unit level, but often units were just not receiving what they needed. So an enormous amount of supplies being poured into what someone described as a large funnel and very little of it actually getting out to the unit level, particularly where units are far flung in the outer provinces, so the further you went the more likely it was that there was some loss of supplies.   BBC:  And what sort of supplies are going missing?   RACHMAN: Fuel is one of the most vulnerable supplies. We heard about ammunition, food, uniforms, virtually anything that is being moved around was potentially vulnerable for resale.   BBC:  You concentrate particularly on fuel. Why was that?   RACHMAN: It was particularly interesting for us, because it is a key supply for enabling operations, so it was of great concern to us if the supplies that the coalition is providing are being stolen to a degree that it鈥檚 hampering operations and it had a direct impact on the ratings of the units in the end.   BBC:  Which raises the question of how well America鈥檚 $27 billion have been spent on training Afghan forces, and how well their capability has been measured. This summer, the US Special Inspector General reported that the system for measuring the capability of Afghan forces was seriously flawed and overstated their ability to operate on their own, without coalition supervision. The report鈥檚 author, Emily Rachman, was alarmed by an example of misplaced confidence.   RACHMAN: We became quite interested in a police district called Baghlan-e Jadid, which is located in the north of the country. We were told that this police district had received a top rating and in fact had fully graduated from the police development programme, meaning that it had achieved a level of competence where it had earned the ability to just operate independently. Of course that鈥檚 our goal for all the Afghan security forces and this piqued our interest. We requested to go out and visit this unit. What we learned as we put in that request was that it was too dangerous to travel to this area and that the capabilities of the police had most likely deteriorated so badly that there was really no law and order being provided by the Afghan forces in that area.   BBC:  You were told that this police district had actually been overrun by insurgents?   RACHMAN: We were, yes.   BBC:  And this was a top rated police district?   RACHMAN: This was a unit that continued to be rated at the top level capability throughout the time of our review, and one of our recommendations was that where no monitoring has been conducted, that we not kid ourselves and report a much higher level of capability than we actually knew to be there."
CombatFootage,"Depends on what your definition on winning is I guess. Plus technically, there are kinda 3 sides fighting to gain something in this war, Ukrainians, Pro-Russian Rebels, and Russia itself.   I assume that the Ukrainian side would like to keep all of Ukraine. They really don't want to split up the country.  The ceasefire is still in effect for now but spring and summer are basically here so we will see if a new offensive begins.  It seems like the Pro-Russians would really like Mariupol at least.  There has been mentioning of giving the Pro-Russians more autonomy and kind of let them govern themselves in the East of Ukraine but they would still be apart of Ukraine.  That way Ukraine would still be a whole and the Rebels get a little more independence.   I'm not fully sure of what Russia's endgame is but it seems like they keep supplying the rebels with heavy weaponry and equipment in order to keep Ukraine unstable.  You have to remember the Ukraine used to be apart of the Soviet Union and it seems like Putins mind is still stuck on that fact.  They already annexed Crimea, which I believe is home to Russia's only warm water naval base or something like that. Before they were leasing the land from Ukraine, but now they own it. I'm sure that if they were able to destabilize the whole country of Ukraine, then they would.  But I think it would be way to obvious and difficult to hide the fact of what they are doing, even though now it's clear as day what they are doing.  Plus now, with all the sanctions that have been put on Russia, their economy is pretty shitty.  Sadly it's the citizens who are the ones hurting the most."
CombatFootage,"Yea that's one reason, they went on a ban spree it seemed awhile ago, even they got called out on it and just said "its on our sidebar, its our rules".

Then you try and defend yourself or facts you posted and you get banned for arguing with another member or some dumb rule. I was banned there 5 months ago by some chick who lives in the states and post mostly about her cats and how she finds odd shit and post it too /r/mildlyinteresting  and has nothing to do with the conflict or live there.

fatpeoplestories,"I'm not an archaeologist, but my thoughts on the matter are:   Do advantages for being thin or fit or otherwise able-bodied exist? i.e. are some people treated better because they're thinner than others? Of course.   Is this advantage a "privilege"? IMHO, no. These advantages exist because evolutionarily and in society, we have always developed to best support the "average" of the population, and until fairly recently, that was the non-obese. The society  could  move to change to better accommodate the obese as well, but until that change happens, it is not a "privilege" for the people who are able to still normally do things (like sit in public seats or buy clothes) to do those things, as  they are/were the standard by which society has built itself .   A privilege implies raising a certain group up to the disadvantage of others, and this simply isn't true--thin people haven't been given any special privileges, it's just that fat people have grown out of what has been for a long time a standard general size of what society expects humans to be."
fatpeoplestories,"See the thing about all of this is that these are things that go through the mind of an addict all the time. But we have to change a few things first.   An addict will constantly search out the thing to give them the fix. (for the fatty it's food)   An addict will never accept help, since they believe they have it under control. They will never accept that they are the cause of their own untimely demise.   The addict will do anything in their power to get their fix. This does in fact mean ANYTHING.   Addicts have a need to get more of what makes them feel good.   And finally addicts will say that no one will understand their problems and blame them all on society, quoting that if so and so never happened  and that if all of these substances were more accepted in society then none of this would have happened. There is no reasoning with the addict, and nothing can be used to help them unless they take the first couple steps themselves (I.E. checking themselves into rehab, finding a support group, or just quitting cold turkey)"
fatpeoplestories,"While I agree, I don't think this is quite right.   It is certainly your choices that led to you becoming fat, but being fat, or being thin is just a state. Your choices in the future determine whether you change that state or not.   Aside from anything else, changing that state requires a lot of work and a lot of determination, much more so than merely maintaining.   Losing weight isn't complicated, but biologically your body is going to rebel against it.   Piling on top of that, what's commonly referred to as "fatlogic" here, while I fully agree it's objectively absurd, is usually a textbook example of addiction thinking.  These people have developed in their heads the same thought patterns, and more importantly the same biochemical dopamine addiction, that a cocaine addict has. And it's not necessarily easier to kick.  Hardcore psychological addition (via the dopamine reward cycle) is often more insidious than a physical addiction. With a physical addiction you  have a shitty detox period and it's over.  Psychological addiction not only lasts longer, but requires changes in your thought patterns.  When you hear someone say "I have a high metabolism and need this much food to function," it's the exact same as a coke addict saying "I need cocaine to focus," or an alcoholic saying "I just need a drink or two to calm my nerves."  I see thin privilege as another symptom of this because it's just a way of enabling addict behavior,  but by the same token, mocking isn't usually a good method to effect behavior change."
fatpeoplestories,"Personally, I think it makes you more human, and your stories believable. There's not a person here who hasn't fucked up. Everyone's done shit that they squirm to remember. And everyone's gonna fuck up some more. The thing is to own it, learn from it, move on, and not do that again.   It's easy to judge some random person on the Net and get a nice high from feeling superior, and also easy to post that you think that person's shit. But it makes you shitty to do that as well, unless the person you're chastising was being an ass to someone else for no reason."

civ5,"I prefer to play on Deity with only a military victory enabled and here is the general starting strat that will put you in a position to build your empire at all levels.     Take that first warrior you begin with and move it out to explore in the direct vicinity of your city.  Think going out to the 3 hex city founding limit and do a complete circuit around.  You will find at least one barbarian encampment this way as well as a good view of your closest available luxury for city founding. a.  Attack your barbarian encampment only when you are above 70% health with your warrior (in the Green).  Use the alert command to heal for one turn and pop right back over there instead of standing to full heal.  Usually you'll get 1 to 2 spawns of the encampment.  By the time you've cleared it up you'll have a lvl 4 warrior.  Do not ride straight towards March(heals every turn no matter what).  Use those promotions to get both levels of your medic ability and then decide if you want to go for march.  I recommend first promotion for rough terrain, but the map should dictate this. b.  DO NOT EXPLORE WITH YOUR WARRIOR.  The harder the difficulty and if you are playing with raging barbarians will ensure that an exploring warrior will end your game with a captured capital.     First thing you build is a worker.  Every civ, every game, every time.  Being able to build in your territory is crucial.  This worker is the foundation of your entire game.  Have it run back to the city if you get even a whiff of barbarians.  It is possible to recover from losing your first worker, but requires a ton of luck at higher difficulties. a.  Unit building is your first objective.  After the worker build a Scout then another Warrior.  At this point you should have grown in population and it's time to build that first Settler!  Move that settler out to the closest new luxury resource that you have found with your circling warrior and found the city.  Don't worry too much about happiness at this point, growth and production are key. b.  After the founding of your 2nd city, it's time to focus on your capital stats.  Unless your are rushing for Wonders, your main focus will be on three areas: Science, Culture, Faith.  All things being equal, the civ with the highest science output will win the game every time.  Access to better units and structures guarantee this.  Culture and Faith are important because they are 'Hard' statistics.  What that means is that they do not scale, they are what they are no matter how big your city or empire becomes.  Science will continue to increase no matter what as long as you have gold.  Gold will fluctuate up and down depending on city size, unit counts and area development.  Happiness will continue to decline.  Culture becomes more and more valuable as the game progresses as each advancement costs more.  The benefits of cultural policies are incomparable with all other aspects of the game.  Cultural dominance is secondary to Science, but since it won't just grow in it's own it takes constant effort to increase.     Research and all the fun science has to offer!  What do you research first?  You'll be tempted by Wonders and units and buildings.  You'll want to go for whatever technology is needed to access your available luxury resources. But the vital first technology is Writing.  That library is the most important thing to have built in your city.  Not too mention while your researching this you'll quickly have access to the shrine and granary, giving you more than enough building options until the research is finished.  I almost always go balls out for building the Great Library wonder as soon as the technology is researched as the free tech is an awesome boost.  Even if someone else builds it first, the gold amount is comparatively massive in early game and can make up for lost time buying units that you could have been building.       That is about all you need to start off strong.  One last tip that I have found makes my marathon/deity games more enjoyable early is war.  After meeting other civs, you are bound to be invited to declare war on someone.  Do it.  Until you get to the point where you are actively planning out an empire road network and deciding which civs stand in your way agree to declare war every time.  The potential gains that you will receive during the peace negotiations can take a frightfully inadequate civilization and turn it into a strong powerhouse earlier than can be expected."
teaching,"I read most of this article and it's really not a good excuse.   It talks about logic a lot, which is ironic considering how ILLOGICAL it is to assume that math is the ONLY or even the BEST way to teach logic to students. I'd say a critical thinking class would be more directly applicable than math, or even a philosophy class.   In fact, a study of philosophy gives people a much better understanding of everyday logic than math because math is a totally different sort of logic. It's the sort a computer does that requires only the following of a strict set of unchanging rules. However, in life, the rules aren't strict, and they ARE changing all the time, and making sound and moral judgments is a key life skill.   As for actually teaching math, my experience is that students are more receptive to it if they have SOME reason for doing it, even if it's an invented one. I had a chemistry teacher who would give us wonderful problems and a story behind them, and we learned the math involved very quickly. We felt rewarded when we solved those problems. However, in my math textbook, it's all numbers. There's no story or purpose to it."

linguistics,"Just a little thing about our language changing with technology.   There's nothing linguistically novel about such sentences, just the circumstances in which a speaker would have a good reason to report their location as such.   >If you were telling someone where you were, you were either yelling it and they were nearby, or you were at a phone   For the former situation it is not hard at all to imagine a speaker uttering, "I'm on the bus."   E.g., say Bob walked onto a lot with a parked bus and any number of other kinds of vehicles.  Alice, unbeknownst to Bob, is on the bus.  Bob says, "Hello?"  Alice responds, "I'm on the bus."  No telephonic communication involved at all.   Sure, it's a contrived example, but there are infinite grammatical sentences that would only make sense under particular circumstances."
linguistics,"To expand a little bit on this, English has over time replaced most of its grammatical  cases  in order to signify if a word was dative (Dative is one of the grammatical cases). Since we no longer used inflection for case for the most part, we use words like "to" to signify an indirect object and "for" to signify the dative of benefit."
Romania,"I didn't come to /r/Romania to accuse you of anything.   And I didn't say you did. Your post is polite and asks valid questions. You didn't ask "What have we done to deserve your criminality?"   But there is the matter of context. For years now we keep hearing how "Romanian nationals" are begging all over Europe, forcibly repatriated from France, scamming people in Spain, raped someone in Italy, and abuse welfare systems. It's often on TV, often on /r/europe (at least in comments). Is this correct? To the word, but rather incomplete. It misses huge numbers of people who go abroad to work or study, never break any law - and don't beg or live on welfare. One person in my extended family, two diplomas, used to spend summer vacations in Spain picking strawberries, because as a single mother she couldn't make ends meet. She wasn't on TV.   So there's a distorted image about Romanians in Europe, and it's a bigger issue than simple narcissism. There are [practical consequences](   With this context in mind, your post can be read as "Romanians... beg... invade our villages... ambassador says silly shit... can't you people pick elderberries or something?". If we knew each other for a while and you asked all that over beers I wouldn't have read any subtext, but we don't, so I do.   >So we, have some experience with our "own" Roma people   There's plenty of integrated Roma here, some are even wealthy or famous. The problem is not ethnicity. Neither is it a nomadic past, nor poverty, nor cultural incompatibility - no one really knows why these people don't integrate, or why they "choose" to live like [this]( or like [this]( Perhaps to keep a low profile? as these communities appear to subsist through low-key criminality, an optimum between survival and getting away with the least convictions.   Little is known of their history or their original culture, if you find any study claiming to solve the Gypsy mistery, it's probably about DNA. Worst of all, I didn't hear of any in-depth inquiry in their way of life in the slums. I suppose - and this is just a guess - that it's endemic poverty; children are sent begging at three, taught scamming at six and learn the art of burglary in prison. Girls are sold^1 into marriage before highschool age. They are not sent to school (both free and obligatory in Romania), some don't even have birth certificates. When they reach adulthood, they don't know of any other kind of life - and frankly, when you can support a family by doing something you are an expert at, would you change? And lose whatever friends or family you had, perhaps even be punished by your former "handler"?   There's a lot to explore for an anthropologist, but sadly there doesn't seem to be any interest in the scientific community. Which may sound unimportant, but leaves us with no explanations and consequently no way to tackle the problems, from child exploitation to social integration. All that is done at the moment is some programs to encourage them to go to school (which don't seem to convince the parents), some anti-discrimination laws (which don't help), and occasional arrests for petty crime, which solve nothing.   Add to that a miserable economy, a corrupt / inept political class, a bankrupt population (of which 90% live on less than 400 euro/month brutto). Boil for twenty years. Stir."

wendywright,"Beliefs. Snobbery. Being a zealot. Ignorance.   When someone puts beliefs ahead of science this is what happens. I work with a lot of religious people in my lab, and they are all accepting that the bible is more of an allegorical tale of morality. It is meant to make an impact and impart and outlook. It is not fact. And they are not ignorant as all hell to the real world, scientific advancement, and research.   When you make the bible fact, you tend to make yourself stupid. I cannot take someone seriously that tells me the earth is 6000 years old when fossil records and Carbon 13 dating prove otherwise. I have not spent all this time getting a Ph.D. in science for someone to go well God says your wrong.   There belief that the bible is fact (I mean really, how many versions and how many translations. And the ideology that Jesus was a white man in the middle east, and virgin birth, etc etc.) falls under so many logical fallacies it is amazing. They use circular logic to cement their faith. The mere reality that they cannot see the Bible is their claim, not their proof is a good indication they have no understanding of the scientific process.   She attacks science like it is a boys club, only letting scientists in. We accept any verifiable, reproducible experimental results. As long as they follow the proper process. But she thinks otherwise, and that we act like a cult. Hiding information from the masses, she has obviously never read a peer reviewed science journal. We let the facts and data fall as the may and interpret the results. But she thinks we sweep things under the rug, which is not the case. She cannot accept that people would fraudulently create scientific evidence, it must be real if it supports her cause. She gets her information from other militant zealots, and not reputable sources. She harps on initial evidence, without reading any further into the findings. She is a typical moronic zealot who has tunnel vision on her beliefs, religion, and cause only. She won't listen to logic either, and uses the largest fallacies possible as an argument/proof.   Then we get to the upper white crust of America, Likely she had nothing to do until this. I would venture to guess she was a militant christian suburban housewife.

Fast drums with crazy fills dominate the song and depending on the sub-genre the bassline differs.   There is hard drum and bass that takes a lot of inspiration from it's roots of Jungle, stuff like [Limewax]( is a prime example, where there is fast drums and large basslines. Noisia aswell is probably the most famous hard drum and bass producer with songs like [Shellshock]( and [Could This Be](   There is also another sub genre called liquid where the basslines are happy instead of angry and it's all about melodies. The most famous of this sub genre has to be Netsky, with songs like [Memory Lane]( Other label friends of his Fred V and Grafix are good aswell, with songs like [Major Happy](   My favourite drum and bass producers are Chase and Status, and they have done many songs such as,  No Problem *.

The real story: in the modular system that is the Flame virus, the bootstrap/installation module is called "Flame", so the researchers saw calls to "InstallFlame.dll" and the like."
Israel,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.. If you would read more about the subject without preemptively blaming Israel, you should know that for the most part the PA is the initiator of this agreement. By doing this they get more donations, rely on the strong Israeli currency and it signifies the occupation for them. They could have build a taxing procedures if they wanted to. In fact, in Oslo they pushed Israel to take responsibility on taxing."
Israel,"Nope. This is not feasible at this point.   You're talking about millions (likely around 5 million) of refugees all getting Israeli citizenship at once. We don't have the economy to support this. Almost no nation  on earth  has the economy to support such large scale immigration, even if only half of the Palestinians decide to immigrate. We experienced a housing crisis when the USSR broke up and hundreds of thousands (eventually over a million) immigrants arrived to the country. There were not enough jobs to support all of them, and for a while, their economic state was abysmal.  And this happened with Jewish immigrants , a lot of them with higher education and good job experience.   If Palestinians are given the right of return, we would literally not have enough jobs, houses or goods to support them all. And i'm not even going to mention the racism they will face, from both the establishment and the Jewish Israeli society, as well as probably racism from their side to the Jewish one. All of this animosity, which  will  emerge from the economic conditions and the already rampant racism on both sides, will unravel the country and destroy lives.   Another thing i'm not mentioning- this won't jibe with the basic concept most Israelis have about Israel. The feeling is that we want a country  of our own , we want to live in a Jewish state, not happen to be a bunch of Jews living in a Palestinian state."
Israel,"1) as i said,the recent nature of their nationhood is not a valid reason to dismiss it  2) "Palestinian" identity is not homogenious in the same way as any other nation is, like the Basques or the Catalans ,Welsh or Inuits.  In fact they have NO unique food, no unique music, no unique history before 1948 , and the "accent" claim is largely arguable as well and is,moreover not the same in Ramallah as in Gaza.  3) the reason why i personally believe their nationhood claim is a sham (though,i again,this is my personal belief) is that it is evidently a product of 3rd party initiatives and meddling and was created expressly as an instrument in the cold war / panarabism power games in the 1950-1970s  4) even assuming their nationhood is fake, that is not a reason to deny them nationhood...if they want to have their own state, let them...this has already been well accepted in principle by israeli majority..  the argument currently is that the palestinians are demanding territorial consessions that would threaten security of the state of israel while having proved that they themselves are not in any form a permanent partner for any sort of long term agreement, what with there not even being single representative body ."
Israel,"This morning was my first Yom Hashoa in Israel. I sat in bed with my girlfriend, listened to the dull whine of the siren and took time to remember what happened to my people. To recall why I live in israel. To be able to love and be loved in the only Jewish nation in the world.  To appreciate this country we have, and the opportunities presented to us young people to do something amazing with what we have fought so hard for. In conclusion, this day of rememberence for an attrocity that defines our people has made me motivated and optimistic about the future, and will do the same to others when they experience it as well."

AskHistorians,"If I've missed someone saying this in the thread, forgive me. Colonial America was divided between the north and the south: in the north, there were mostly people who wanted to get away from the social structures they'd left behind in Europe, while in the south, there were mostly people who wanted to carry those structures over, only with themselves on top. (Yes, this is a huge oversimplification. Forget it, I'm on a roll.) Slavery existed in the north, mostly for household servants and industrial labor, but it made much more sense in the south, where it provided cheap agricultural labor. The north profited from slavery immensely, by insuring slave traders and buying the raw materials the south produced, among other things. But one way of understanding the Civil War is that the north began to get the idea that a slave-holding south wasn't in its financial interests. The war was fought in large part to prevent the expansion of slavery westward, which would have upset the fragile economic and political balance of the antebellum period.   As well, the north industrialized much earlier than the south, leading to two fundamentally different economic orders. In the north, there were free farmers, financial services, and industry. In the south, it was almost all agriculture all the time: mostly small free farms with fewer, large-scale plantations staffed by slaves thrown in.   So far, just basic history. The result of the initial conditions I've sketched out is that the northern part of the US developed as a relatively homogeneous, industrialized society. Yes, they had trouble absorbing immigrants from Ireland, Italy and Eastern Europe, but as most people know, the northern part of the US is basically white. As a result, it developed on a similar track to western Europe, what most of us would recognize as liberal democracy.   The south, on the other hand, was both rural  and  divided racially. That meant it developed much more unequally, closer to what you would see in Latin America. Sociologically, the South resembles Colombia or Brazil in a lot of ways.   Anyway, what about California and the rest of the West Coast? Well, they developed relatively late, and many of the people who migrated to the large coastal cities did so because they wanted to escape the racial and economic divides in their home states. The people who settled inland were often poor farmers (read: Okies) who brought their existing prejudices with them.   Again, all oversimplified, and it leaves out some parts, such as why Los Angeles or San Francisco grew up into tolerant, multi-cultural cities, or the effect religion has on all of it, but there you have it."
AskHistorians,"Paper (papyrus in the ancient world) can't survive in the long term except in special circumstances. It can be burned as you mentioned, but it's also vulnerable to water and humidity. If a piece of papyrus wasn't stuck in a cave in the Judean desert, buried under the sand in Egypt, or preserved by the eruption of Vesuvius, it hasn't survived.   Parchment, made from animal skin, was used in the Middle Ages and is stronger than papyrus. We still have parchment manuscripts from late antiquity that have survived intact, and more may yet turn up.   That said, the Romans did leave behind quite a bit of documentary evidence. Many papyri from Roman Egypt have been found, as have countless stone inscriptions from all over the empire."
AskHistorians,"I'm not a historian, but I had the same question. I was directed to a book called:  The Case for Christ by Lee Strobel . It's about a journalist's personal investigation for evidence of Jesus and who He was. I think there are references for sources to the info provided. I'm not sure, its been a while."
AskHistorians,"This isn't entirely accurate. Old Norse (ON) and Old English (OE) married and there is some contention that OE is a creole of ON now and that the only reason we don't treat it as such is that OE and ON were so remarkably similar already the process didn't happen in the same way.   To my knowledge, no non-creole language has ever adopted so many core vocabulary items from a language.  Pronouns, for example.  Also, the reason Modern English has so few declensions is directly due to the influence of Old Norse."
AskHistorians,"That's a good question. Part of me wants to say that it helped keep France out of the Soviet sphere of influence, but then again, there's no telling if Germany would've surrendered with the fall of Berlin. Resistance cells would've likely risen up and pushed the remaining troops out of France, given that Germany would've been able to pull more troops out of France to stem the tide of the Russians.   It's also possible that there would be two separate states, the "Free France" state and the Vichy State, because said resistance cells (now turned into a formal militia) may not have been able to overtake those French troops...I'm going to just stop here because this isn't /r/HistoricalWhatIf and there's no need for further speculation."
AskHistorians,"In an ideal world, you would command a surprising number of languages.  Attic/Koine/Byzantine/Modern Greek, Latin, French, German, Russian, Ottoman/Modern Turkish, and Arabic. (maybe Persian and Coptic?)   But as /u/emilytried mentioned, all aren't of equal importance and are dependent upon what era you're choosing to focus on.   As a baseline, you need to know Greek.  But unfortunately, Greek from Attic to Modern is almost as wide a variance as from Latin to Standard Italian, especially since they roughly cover the same time frame.   Though you'd think that since you're studying the Byzantine era you'd want to learn Byzantine Greek, a lot of Byzantine documents are written with an eye on emulating either Attic or Koine Greek for prestige purposes.  Procopius is a Byzantine historian writing in Attic that comes to mind.  Also the resources for studying specifically Byzantine Greek are far less than for the other three.  For that reason alone, I would recommend learning Koine Greek, as it's a bridge between Attic and Byzantine, and given that it's the language of the church, would be helpful in reading religious texts and their particular vocabulary.   After Koine Greek, I'd recommend learning French and German.  This is in fact standard in the academic community, as most scholarship if it's not generated in english, will be in French or German, reflecting the three languages of the most prestigious and best funded universities in the world.   These three, Koine Greek, German, and French are the most essential for starting building blocks.  The other languages are for depending upon which era you want to focus on.   If you're dealing with the Early Byzantine/Late Roman era (285-630), then Latin is also required, as there was still a lot of administration done in that language, and you'd have to have a solid command of it.  Outside of Latin, maybe Coptic and Persian to deal with Byzantine Egypt and Sassanid Persia.   If you're dealing with the Middle Byzantine era (630 - 1025), then I'd recommend adding Arabic, as so much of that era is defined by Byzantine/Caliphate interactions.  And for interactions with the west, you don't need to know Latin quite as much as you can deal with secondary sources written in English, German or French on those subjects, as by then the language of Byzantine administration is all in Greek, unlike in the early era.  I'd also make a pitch for adding Russian to the mix, as the middle Byzantine era is when a lot of the Slavic polities really began to come into sharp focus in their conflict with Byzantium, however current Russian/Slavic research isn't "quite" as robust these days as English/German/French into this era.   Lastly for the late Byzantine era (1025 - 1453), Ottoman/Modern Turkish will be of a massive help to study the final fall of the empire.  There's actually a lot of good research and archaeology being generated out of Turkey on the Byzantine Empire of all eras that simply isn't being read because of the inability for most non-specialist scholars to read turkish.  If you truly want to stand out in Byzantine study, I'd recommend tackling this language.   So"
AskHistorians,"Yes and no.   The puplished plans for an attack, which where optained by Western powers after 1989, did include very specific, and agressive plans for an invasion of Western Europe. Even printed, congratulatory letters, to the Eastern European leaders, expressing the USSR's great apreciation for their victory, in their respective sectors of the European war-theatre.   The initiation of theese plans where always thought to be a, genuine, Western provocation. It is important to remember how the two sides entered the Cold War. USA entered victorius and with the A-bomb, while the USSR entered devastated and with a very real paranoia, that the Western powers would turn on the USSR at any given moment. British plans to use German POWs against the USSR where later revealed, and during the time of American, atomic hegemony, a nuclear-backed invasion was discussed among the military leadership of the USA. The Soviet anexation of Eastern Europe, as well as their paranioa-filled military planning, has to be seen in this light.   An asymetric measure of force, compared to what NATO was planning, was evident in the plans of the USSR. If a conflict erupted, NATO planned to fire a nuclear warning shot over the Atlantic, hopefully followed by negosiations.  Where as the USSR planned to nuke the Danish town of Esbjerg, followed by a full occupation of Western Europe, Yugoslavia and Sweden excluded, as their warning shot. Theese shots would have been fired two to three days into a conventional conflict on the European continent.  Both the USA and the USSR knew that an invasion of Europe was a conflict senario that might have escalated into an all out nuclear war, but didn't have to. The USSR planned on using tactical nukes on every Western European port during an invasion. In such a senario, the USA was considered, even by it's NATO allies, to be most likely to abandon Western Europe all togheter. That was one of the greatest driving factors behind Frances' and the UKs' acquisition of their own nuclear devices.   Everyone expected the Atlantic sea to be a barier that would weight stronger than NATO. If no nukes crossed it, World War III would have been short. The USA, accepting the loss of Western Europe. There where no such buffer-zone between the Eastern European SSR's and Russia. Had anyone provoced the territorial integrity of the USSR as a whole, the whole of Europe, excluding Sweden and Yugoslavia (possibly Albania to?) would have become SSRs.   My sources are primarily a lecture by a former Danish general, who was in service during the eighties and early nineties. With more information gathered at my university, since the former NATO general wasn't too keenly elaborating on anything, but the plans of the USSR."
AskHistorians,"That's a difficult question. As far as I know we don't have much to work with in terms of sources (stuff this old is way out of my league).   There's a mention of some kind of war-song in Tacitus' Germania:   > III   > They narrate of Hercules鈥?erstwhile stay With them and sing to him before the fray To him number one hero among the strong.   > They also have many a 鈥榖aritus鈥?song auguring the impending battle鈥檚 fate With notes possessing a rhythmic clout kindling their souls as they鈥檙e belted out And according as their bands resonate Scare their foes while they themselves trepidate As more than voices they have the illusion Of hearing of valour the warlike fusion Both harshness and asperity Along with a broken clamour Are sought out particularly With mouths and tongues lambent To the shields of the armour So that harder and louder may boom The reverberating voice of doom   Ammianus Marcellinus also mentions something that might have been some kind of war-song war-cry (that the Romans didn't like):   > XXXI.7.11   > Therefore when the armies on both sides, advancing more cautiously, at last halted and stood immovable, the warriors, with mutual sternness, surveying each other with fierce looks. The Romans in every part of their line sang warlike songs, with a voice rising from a lower to a higher key, which they call barritus, and so encouraged themselves to gallant exertions. But the barbarians, with dissonant clamour, shouted out the praises of their ancestors, and amid their various discordant cries, tried occasional light skirmishes.   Jordanes also talks about music (maybe about the Goths) in his Getica:   > V.43   >  They were the first race of men to string the bow with cords, as Lucan, who is more of a historian than a poet, affirms: "They string Armenian bows with Getic cords." In earliest times they sang of the deeds of their ancestors in strains of song accompanied by the cithara; chanting of Eterpamara, Hanala, Fritigern, Vidigoia and others whose fame among them is great; such heroes as admiring antiquity scarce proclaims its own to be.   I guess those are not terribly useful to really know about Germanic music...   Getting a little closer to the Holy Roman Empire, we find the so called Carolingian Renaissance. By that time, the chant of the Church in Rome was migrating north.   Charlemagne invited Albinus of York (an English scholar) around 781 to set up a cathedral school. The curriculum was that of the trivium and quadrivium, this last one including music. Now, by music I mean mostly some ancient Greek theory (which includes the maths to determine musical notes by using ratios and lengths on a taut string).   It was decided to unify the liturgy of all the realm (which was quite big). This meant the previous forms of chant (including Gallican chant) had to go. It was not an easy process, and this effort of standardization was significant for the history of music because we see the Western musical notation appearing during/after that process.   Do we have any concrete German musical examples from before the HRE? I am not sure. Well, I think it's closer to "no, not really" but "kind of" if you are not too picky.   The  Planctus (de obitu) Karoli . We have music associated with it, but the notation (which is one of the earliest kinds we have) is not from the time the text was written. I cannot tell if the music was composed much later, or if it was communicated via oral tradition and then notated. In any case, [here's a video]( Compare the previous recording to [this one]( or even to [this other](   That notation is very problematic. You see the text, and then some neumes (dots and squiggles) above it. Those are not very specific... Be very sceptic about recordings of this sort of music. Yes, a lot of knowledgeable people have worked hard to get an idea of what all that sounded like, but the information we have is very limited. Some speculation is needed to attempt to recreate pretty much all music earlier than the 19th century, attempting to recreate music from neumes obviously requires MUCH more.   We have every reason to believe there was non-liturgical, non-religious music, and that there could be music with more instruments than the voice (with more instruments playing at once, too). However, I don't know of any surviving example of such music."
AskHistorians,"Marius' reforms did do away with the original unit 'classes'. (for want of a better word)   In the Roman legions, the role of the average soldier was highly dependent upon your income, land ownership and position in society. As a citizen army, each man was responsible for equipping himself to fight, the poorest citizens, and young sons generally constituted the Velites (the most lightly equipped of soldiers, comprised mostly of the 5th social class, the proletarii) Hastati were generally slightly better off, able to afford better equipment, and so were from the higher class. Principes were a step higher, either promoted Hastati, or richer citizens who could afford better equipment. Triarii were usually veterans, who had previously served, rich with spoils from war. Cavalry were generally recruited from the young men of the knight class. (hence Equites - Equestrian order)   So in comes Marius, and the major point of his reforms. By recruiting from the 6th social order, the portion of the citizenry previously referred to as the capite censi (lit. Head Count) potential soldiers could simply not afford to buy their own equipment. Through service they could become enfranchised, Roman Citizens and gain land and spoils. Unsurprisingly many flocked to join the new legions. The state then had to supply the arms and equipment, leading to the creation of the new soldier: the legionary with equipment closely matching the pre-marian Principes. The only way for the state to easily equip and maintain the legions was through standardisation, and Marius accounted for this, his reforms changed how the legion's baggage was handled, their equipment and their organisation as a standing army. Vastly increasing the nascent empire's military effectiveness.   Of course, the reforms were instrumental in the rise of tyrants, the destruction of the republic and the creation of the Roman Empire."
AskHistorians,"In response to your first question regarding Shinto/nationalism:     See Fujitani Takashi's  Splendid Monarchy  where it lays out how the Meiji leaders shaped the nation through the manipulation of Shinto practices and superstition and tying these ideas into the created symbol of the Emperor.     Shinto before 1868 was highly merged with Buddhism, but in the Meiji period Shinto and Buddhism were separated. Shinto, as it is more a vague space of terms, became an easy vehicle to create the concept of a nation and regain public confidence since there was a regime change and the populace was not too pleased with its government's cozy tendencies with the foreigners barraging into Japan.     How was Shinto used? It gave a mythical element to the Emperor and legitimacy. It made the country "united" from a random set of villages that are mildly aware of each other. The leadership was highly involved in this process, and many aspects were manufactured. This is where some "traditional Japanese" statements get said in public discourse, when in actuality, it's made up traditional Japanese.     Yes, technically Shinto became a bit of a political ideology, generally just known as State Shinto, since it was run by the government. (It even has its own branch for a few years.)     I wouldn't say Shinto influenced the decision to participate. Japan's decisions as early as 1931 were clearly not Shinto/religious based, but more so colonial and imperial. However, sometimes it was used as part of political rhetoric to spearhead causes or excuse them.     Lastly, background speaking: for a good understanding of the Shinto/Buddhism divide that happens with the Meiji Restoration, I highly recommend  The Invention of Religion in Japan  by Jason Josephson.       So basically,"
undelete,"I thought an upvote in /r/undelete meant, "This is interesting for some reason. You should read the comments." It certainly doesn't mean, "I agree with the reasons behind this deletion." But going by what people downvote, a downvote means, "This pissed me off", so I'm not sure what an upvote means unless it's the same as a downvote."
tales,"I don't think it's necessarily the story telling aspect. Apparently games like Mass Effect, Bioshock, etc. have a great story line. I use apparently because FPS's make me physically ill so I can't speak from personal experience. Also, Metal Gear series is huge too.   When you're talking about JRPG's, I honestly think it's more of a market thing. The general US market seems to prefer quick action games without too many cinematics. Some complaints I heard about FFXIII, for example, were how long and how frequent the cinematics were. Characters and the linear passages were another huge factor, obviously. Of course, the counter argument is that MGS IV sold very well in the US and the cinematics can be an hour long. But, it has guns.   What I do know is that the US market prefers RPGs with a huge open environment like Skyrim and MMOs. JRPG's are typically linear, for the most part."
jobs,"MY cousin has had a rough time. He went out oh high school and started to work in a plant that did recycling cell phone batteries. Recession hit and the position he had had for over 10 years was downsized.   The guy had been married for a few years, has two children and a wife. On the up side she works and gets paid well.   Onto the point, He had a family to provide for, so he did not apply for EI, he got a job at KFC. The sad part is a lot of people made fun of him for it. Work is work and a dollar is a dollar. You could see it killed him to tell people where he worked as it was 1/3 the hourly rate. He took as many shifts as they would let him.   Moral of the story is everyone needs to work, a job may not be your ideal one but sometimes you need to do what you can to live."
jobs,"Some people shouldn't be an interviewer. I had an interview with a company that went south within 5 minutes of the start of it. The interviewer just got more abusive and I terminated the interview.

jobs,"I think of my "network" as the list of people I could phone today, make small talk with, and ask at least a small favour of, without feeling very awkward, or like I was reaching hugely. -  not  the list of people I'm connected to on LinkedIn.   Finding more people like that is "networking" in my mind.   A lot of this is a combination of putting yourself in situations where you're around other people, being a memorable person, being a person worth knowing and, most importantly, being likeable.   It varies from informal (E.g making an effort to eat lunch with people from the office, keeping up with people where possible) to quite formal (going to conferences, producing peer reviewed papers etc).   This is like asking "how do I manage my career?" The advice is massive, expansive, and varies based on a huge amount of factors.   Really we can only give you "next step" advice...and even then this stuff is very fluffy!   Step 1? Make an effort to get to know the people in your current job/class/peer group better.   Have you already achieved that? Not at that stag yet?   Coming back and asking a more specific question will get you best results.   Take homes:     A quickly built or artificial network probably isn't a very strong one     people who can network their way  into  entire industries usually have leverage - expertise, vast experience in another area, influence/connections in another industry, or precocious interpersonal skills. In other word, it's not the 'done' way to enter most industries.     being likeable has it's own benefits outside of explicit "networking" and is always good advice."

bisexual,"I can understand, it just takes time. For me I got it more from women that wanted a "manly" man. Just b/c I liked my hair long and generally liked more feminine stuff I couldn't get a date. Unfortunately there was not too many guys in my area that were on the market for me so I had to wait. In the end glad I did."
bisexual,"The most important thing to highlight is that you could get a lot of benefit from talking to a therapist, someone trained to work with sexual abuse, same sex attraction and post traumatic stress disorder. But apart from that, here's my personal thoughts.   You've been through a lot and your body is still holding onto some of those stresses. If things have improved (even lightly) over the months or years since the abuse happened, it's a good sign that you're on your way to mending and you should be patient with yourself. If things haven't improved, see the first point (therapist).   A certain level of trust, the ability to be vulnerable and being allowed to surrender to someone are all important with sex. A man is physically and psychologically weakest and most vulnerable at orgasm, and it's no wonder your body is short circuiting that from happening with other men. It needs to be brought up to date and realize the threat of harm is long gone.   Without going into the details of the abuse (and I don't know how to put this any other way, I'm so sorry if it is shocking), sometimes the body can physically become aroused even though it is an assault and not consensual. If this happens, it can lead to guilt or shame, making a person think they enjoyed it. This is not true. Is this the case with you? Could it be that sex with men brings up feelings of shame, either from the previous point, or even other reasons? if yes, until you address that, you won't be able to enjoy making love to men.   Was disciplinary action taken on them? Did you report it? have you spoken to anyone about it? It's possibly (and heck, there's millions of possibilities but this is just what's coming to mind) that you're stopping yourself from same-sex sex until a part of you feels it gets a chance to speak out and be heard.   The other thing is that sex is one thing, love making is another. The guys you've been with, do you have a deep emotional and/or spiritual bond with them? If you don't have that, it's fucking. maybe you need to make love to someone. maybe you need to get to know someone so well, and feel so safe with them after weeks and weeks of cuddling and being emotionally vulnerable, that only then the act of sex will happen in a way you're comfortable with, leading to orgasm.   You have to reprogram positive experiences into your mind, about physical intimacy with men. Even if that means finding a friend to just cuddle with.   Lastly, if you're having sex with people who can't understand or empathise with you that there's other stuff going on beneathe your surface, they're either not the right person for you, or, you've jumped too quickly into bed with them.   Does any of that fit with you? I'd love to hear your thoughts."
katawashoujo,"alternative existence"   Disclaimer: I assumed you were referring to your own 'existence'.   As poetic and fitting as that sounds (I'll be stealing that term from you, btw :p), I find it a little misleading, for the story of KS never depicted YOU in some other - and in ways, unfortunately - false reality. KS tells the tale of Hisao, how he deals with his recently discovered disability, his attempts to fit in his new school environment, per se, and simultaneously endure the throes of love with one of five (awesome) women. As engaging as the story may be, it was never about you (that even makes me sad).   Also, realize in each story there is a fuck load of shit that really doesn't go Hisao's nor his partner's way. I would rather not go in to detail, although one example would be  spoiler . You may claim that the love between the two had already been established, and that the travesty above simply detracted from it, but that is besides the point. These "happy" conversations you have with the girls in your class are, in fact, the first of the many stepping stones of which you must traverse to obtain your ultimate goal; love. Perhaps walking along said path with some won't end well or as you imagined (regardless how much you actually like the person), but be happy that the likelihood of  spoiler  is pretty damn low.   I do recognize the fact my logic is convoluted and a little stupid, but I felt from reading your post that you were under the impression these "happy convos" with girls is what takes away, or prohibits, from loving them - or learning to do so -  spoiler . The only way Hisao got to know, and eventually passionately love each girl in KS was through "happy talks". One's inner beauty is exactly that: inside them and, for some, hard to find. The thing about Hisao's story is that it the intrinsic beauty of some girls sort of fell right under his nose. You're going to have to do a lot more leg work.   Somewhat irrelevant"
katawashoujo,"G-Senjou no Maou (The Devil on G-String) is a great VN that I played after KS. It has... some quirks, but nothing you wouldn't expect from an eastern perspective rather than a western perspective.   There's 4 girls that you have options with, but the game has a 'true route'. Let me tell you, the ending to the true route made me curl up on my bed like a little girl. That shit twisted the knife more than Hanako's good ending.   In the beginning, it doesn't seem like much. In fact I even threw around the idea of dropping it all together. But when you get deeper into the game, the more ideas you begin to fabricate. Hell, I thought I was so smart having the ending all figured out. You wouldn't believe what I felt when the game pulled the rug out from under me so fast I never saw it coming.   As with everything, you get some shit with the plot. However, Act 4 and 5 pretty much made up for everything in the prior routes."

She interacted with them, disrobed herself, and discussed the details of her breasts with the men. Would a reasonable person believe that she was not being recorded during that? Most likely.   Then comes the issue of consent once again. She was intoxicated. Can an intoxicated person consent to expose themselves willingly? I would think so, but I admit I do not know case law history in FL related to this issue.   2d) Sexual organ- I don't think breasts would qualify.   Okay so that covers definitions. Let's look at the statute itself:   2a) intentional use- yes. videographer intentionally videotaped. Was it secret? He had it out in the open. Was she aware of it at the time? Could she prove she was not aware of it at the time? Not remembering it =/= not being aware. That'd be a tough thing to prove in court, especially considering she interacted with the videographer in the video. Additionally, it requires the lack of knowledge  and  lack of consent. Consent is muddy and knowledge is muddy also. Could honestly go either way. Regardless, it's only relevant if it happens at a time when the person is "undressing... at a time when that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy." Once again, if she voluntarily strips for them, would she have a reasonable expectation that they would not record her? My best guess is that this statute was enacted to cover issues of voyeurism where people would install cameras inside bathrooms to videotape women changing or using the restroom without their knowledge and consent, hence the wording. I doubt it was crafted with this purpose, but nevertheless could be interpreted as such.   On distribution, it would be a crime if the prior elements were satisfied to qualify as video voyeurism (which, as I said, is gray at best).  And  the distribution must be for the purpose of "amusement, entertainment, sexual arousal, gratification, or profit, or for the purpose of degrading or abusing another person." Their initial distribution would certainly qualify as one of those conditions, whether sexual arousal, entertainment, amusement, etc. However, someone leaking the video to shine light on the true incidents of the night, in order to contest the one-sided reports, along with an explicitly stated reasoning at the time of distribution that accompanies the video  may not qualify under those conditions ."
gundeals,"I own this case, bought it last year. I was pretty impressed. I can't remember what I paid for it, it was on sale at walmart and I bought it to carry my guns when I flew to my hometown for Christmas.   Foam inside is almost pre-cut into blocks that were easy to remove to fit for my guns. You don't have to use a knife like a Pelican. The latches are nice positive clamps. One problem I did have was one of the locks on the clamp wouldn't unlock. No matter how many times I tried the key I just couldn't get it. I finally said screw it and pushed the case in away from the clamp and was able to open it when it was locked. So I wouldn't rely on those keys to lock it. I used TSA locks instead anyways so it doesn't change much for me."
HeroesofNewerth,"I've got to disagree a bit on Aluna being a support. She surely can be played that way, but she's much more of a ganker than anything.   Take into account her abilities: a chain stun that increases her attack speed. a trajectory throw that does dmg/ clears trees A movement speed increase that can slow enemies. an ult that modifies/increases all these skills.   She's built to stun people, hit them quickly and, if they need to be finished, power sticked."
HeroesofNewerth,"Trees and cliffs block vision. This is a vital information you need to know before you place a ward. However, the circle will make most newbies think that they will have vision inside it, while in almost every case this is completely false. The rev wards, in the other hand, DO give vision over the invisible heroes/units even if the trees block the vision, which means that the circle around it is not causing any confusion."
HeroesofNewerth,"There was no injustice done to you.    There were some problems in the beginning (him picking pyro instead of ss), but they were resolved and he complied when you explained the rules   Him as EU player can host the match on USE for best ping, so you shouldn't bash him for that.   Eventually, you BOTH played Soulstealer, and you lost.   I decided it was a beginner's mistake that you guys chose the Round 1 hero instead of the correct Round 2, and said the score stands.   You then proceeded to take this on the Xfire channel, and tried to bash him publicly, saying he should be DQ'd for his Pyro mistake, but the game was played with BOTH players on SS. So you have no right to do this.   I said disputes should be debated in private, not public. You started to insult us, so I silenced you."
BDSMcommunity,"My sub and I are still figuring out our power exchange, but I am so happy and lucky to have her. Since this is my first  and only relationship with a strong Power Exchange dynamic, I have no one else to compare her to, but I can certainly tell what I like about her submission to me.   1) She is REALLY SMART and WISE. I know this because we talk all the time about every topic under the sun and she never ceases to amaze me with her wit, wisdom, insight and intelligence. 2) She is VERY STRONG, not a wilting wallflower. I have seen her really angry on occasion (not at me). And she doesn't hesitate to speak her mind or stand up for herself.   In spite of both of those points, her intelligence and her strength, she submits to me almost completely. In other words, I find it incredibly hot  that someone so smart, capable, competent and strong wants to submit to me and does so ao completely and willingly.   Also, COMMUNICATION. As I said above, we talk all the time. This is in spite of being in a long distance relationship. We talk about everything. There is no hesitation or fear WHATSOEVER on either of our parts to say what we're thinking or what needs to be said. There is nothing worse for a relationship than wondering if you're "allowed" to say this  or that, for fear of crossing some line or causing offense. Neither of us do that. Ever.   All that communication has resulted in a deep and profound level of TRUST. And in that trust, she submits to me (almost) completely and utterly.   I am so fucking lucky, I dont even know what to do with myself. To be submitted to and (even better) LOVED by one such as her makes me so very happy."
BDSMcommunity,"As a woman in a poly relationship, I would be offended if someone messaged my male partner instead of me if they were interested in playing with me or dating me. Perhaps these folks are trying not to be sexist and assume you control her interactions with other people. In D/s relationships, of course, it can totally be a part of your dynamic that people have to message you on fetlife, and not her. But for that to happen, you'd need to talk to her about it, she'd need to want that to be a part of your dynamic, and she'd need to have it on her profile. Because you didn't mention any sort of agreement about this issue, I really doubt these other doms are being disrespectful by messaging her. I mean, they're not asking to play with you, they're asking to play with her! And she's definitely done nothing wrong. She's not initiating these messages, she's not even responding.   You guys clearly need better communication. You're not holding her back if you let her know what makes you uncomfortable, you're just protecting her from accidentally hurting you. I'm sure she doesn't want to hurt you.   I'd say you need to fess up about the fetlife snooping, too. She wasn't the one who broke your trust in a previous relationship, so you should try to give her the benefit of the doubt. You can probably talk to her about how insecure you feel because of prior bad experiences, and work on recovering from the relationship that damaged you so badly.   It seems like your heart is in the right place, but your behavior isn't."
BDSMcommunity,"I will be working on my gag reflex, and trying the thumb trick mentioned. My problem comes from just an issue with non-edibles in general. When I was in high school drama the teacher had us practice lines with a pencil in our mouth like a bit, and even that took me a while to get comfortable with. This is why the idea of tape or the half hood appeals to me. However, I did get used to the pencil, and so I will work toward desensitizing my gag reflex thanks to the encouragement here. Up till now it had not been a huge issue. This should be an update on the post, but my app won't do that and I'm not home right now."

webdev,"Salts don't render hash tables useless, they only render "naive" hash tables useless.   Using unique salts mean that rainbow tables have to be generated for every user. Depending on the algorithms used to hash the password, this would be an unfeasible amount of time or data.   > If you choose the username as a salt, it stands to reason that many other site admins probably use that scheme too. An attacker might decide to compute hash tables offline for the million most common passwords using the million most common usernames (well within the realm of possibility). Now they have a set of hash tables they can use on anyone's database that uses the username as a salt.   While that sounds great and all, it would only work if every site is hashing the password in exactly the same way. If you throw in a large random static key into the hashing algorithm, you can make sure that your hashes are never the same as another site's hashes, even if they used the same salt and password.   Also, even if the above scenario happened, we are still talking about a massive amount of time and data storage to generate rainbow tables for every single user. If you use something like bcrypt, generating rainbow tables for every user is just not going to happen.   > Secondly, if your database is compromised, and you use the same salt scheme as someone else, the attacker can easily compare databases and see if anyone is using the same password.   Once again, this relies on the fact that other sites use the exact same hashing algorithm. And, again, a static site key thwarts this as well."
Chefit,"One of the most influential and humbling events for me as a chef was visiting a small meat processing facility in rural Vermont. I was a culinary student, and we had the opportunity to visit this facility so I eagerly signed up to go. While there we saw a couple cattle come through the process, from live animal all the way down to sub-primals and consumer cuts. The experience gave me a much deeper respect for the meat that I cook both on the line at at home. It is no longer just a cut of meat, but instead a culmination of an animal's life, as well as that of the farmer, the butcher, and the cook.   A year after my visit to the processor I had the chance to visit again. This time I was able to bring a few friends from school, which was even better because I needed to share the experience with people that share the same ideals of cooking and ethics as me. This time we saw a couple of pigs get killed and processed. This second outing was even more impactful than the first, because pigs die much more violently than their bovine bretheren. Watching the first pig flop around the killfloor like a fish out of water was one of the more difficult things I had ever sat through (I was told that it was the nervous system firing off dead signals, but that didn't make it any easier.) After watching that a couple more times I left with a deep respect for the bacon we so mindlessly throw onto dishes these days.   I think these experiences really drove home the idea of nose to tail cooking in me. I had liked the idea before visiting the slaughterhouse, but afterwards it felt to be the only right option. I feel we owe it to the animals that gave us their bodies and lives to use as much of them as possible.   Thank you for posting this. I think that it is an experience that every person who prepares meat should have. Witnessing the end of a food animal's life and seeing it go from a whole animal to in the pan will change the way you view the meat in your pan."
Chefit,"When I was still wet behind the ears I got a job washing dishes at the ritziest place in the city. Our head Chef (we'll call him Steve) studied in France and won a few awards in his career.  We also had a prestigious cooking college in town so every year we'd take a handful of culinary students for some on-the-job training so they could get their hours to graduate and out of every dozen students who came through I'd say that maybe one had what it took to survive in a kitchen. This was Steve's opinion as well. I'd catch Steve muttering or talking to the regular staff about how these kids are no damn good and don't want to work.   Fast forward a few months and I end up doing some prep work and managed to cook a few meals on the line during slow periods. No culinary student was hired.   Long story short, years later I was handpicked by Steve to work at his son's newly opened restaurant.   So yeah, any chef who's been around awhile certainly values a hard worker and a quick learner over a piece of paper. I would recommend getting a culinary text book so you have a good working knowledge of the base techniques and apply to places with a menu you're comfortable with."
hoarding,"VERSION WITH PARAGRAPHS   Ever since I can remember, my mom has had a shopping addiction.   Every day my mom would come home from work, arms full of shopping bags filled with new things. She was always getting caught up in some product. For a while she wouldn鈥檛 stop buying Beanie Babies, then it was Boyd鈥檚 Bears, then it was jewelry beads, then it was yarn, then it was Barbie Dolls. She would buy these things in excess and pile them in some room. Later in life, my dad accused her of having a hoarding problem. She refused.   About 4 years ago, my mom decided to move into her own apartment a few hours away from the house we grew up in. She moved into a fairly small one bedroom apartment, taking with her the necessities- her clothes, furniture, and basic household items. 2 years ago I decided to move in with her briefly to save some money. When I first started living with her, I noticed small piles of things had begun to build up, but nothing too terrible. However, when I looked inside her closets I found shelves full of hand soap, candles, medications, lotions, cleaning products, and paper products (10 times the amount one person needs). Her bedroom closet was over stuffed with clothing -enough for probably 5 people. Her shoes spilled out of the closet into her room. Her dressers were piled high with jewelry and clothing that couldn鈥檛 fit into her dresser drawers. And the floor was scattered with grocery bags filled with items like wrapping paper and holiday knick knacks.   A few months in, we upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment one building over. Once we were in the 2 bedroom apartment, I started noticing her shopping habits had really picked up. Every day she came home, bringing in bag after bag. I would ask her how she could afford these things but she would just change the subject and get angry.   Eventually, every nook and cranny in this new apartment was full. They were expensive items (however mostly useless in my eyes). I could not just throw these things away and not feel guilty. These were hundreds of dollars鈥?worth of items taking over the apartment.   Finally, I decided it was time to move out when she explained to me she wanted to move into a bigger apartment. The day after I moved, I came back to her apartment to get anything I may have left behind. I also thought it would be ok for me to take some things that she had duplicates of. For example, my mother had 5 serving spoons. She doesn鈥檛 have any people over and she doesn鈥檛 go to parties. There is no reason she needs 5 serving spoons. However when she saw me take one, she threw a tantrum and took it out of my moving box. She then began to search the items I had put in there and claimed items I bought were hers and that I couldn鈥檛 have them.   Over the weekend, it was time for my mom to move out of her apartment into the new one. She had asked my sister and my brother to come up (they both live a few hours away) and help her move. I called them a few days ahead and warned them that she had gathered up so much stuff as of recently that it was going to be an almost impossible task. They said they were still going to help.   Upon arrival of her apartment, hardly anything had been packed. Piles of junk had been pushed into the center of the apartment. You could barely move. We could not even move her big furniture at first because too much stuff was in the way. Bins stuffed with Barbie doll bodies, rubber maids full of holiday towels, boxes filled nail polishes, and crates filled with nothing but brand new Yankee candles. Wedged in between these items were things that could have been thrown away, like magnets, chip bag clips, pens that do not work anymore, miscellaneous stationary, old newspaper ads, rolls of broken tape dispensers, and old tubes of Vaseline. Along with that, we were moving things that had never been used, still in their original packaging with the tags attached.   Eventually we got fed up, and the moving was no longer a process of helping her get situated into a new place; it was now a mission to get her stuff from point A to point B. We were stuffing things in boxes and garbage bags, tossing them into the truck, and then tossing them into her new place.   The new place was now filled with loose crap, stuffed boxes and spilling shopping bags. It took us 14 hours of intensive labor from the 3 of us to get it done. We had to do 4 trips with the 10 foot truck and at least 9 trips with my sister鈥檚 car. My mother was a nightmare the entire time. She would throw a tantrum when we would confront her with the situation and how messed up it was. She insisted everything was normal. She never apologized or said thank you. And now she is left alone in an apartment literally piled with crap and I am worried it is going to stay that way forever.   I am posting my story here because I would appreciate some outside opinions and support. Is this still considered hoarding if the living conditions are not dirty and unsanitary? Everything she keeps originally cost money. Is it more of a shopping addiction? What can we do? Does anyone else know what it is like to be in a situation like this and how do you cope? Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated."
weightroom,"With your strength levels and goals, 5/3/1 seems like a great choice. The best part of 5/3/1 (IMO) is that there is nothing except for The Big Four that is set in stone.

Want to do conditioning? No problem either."
weightroom,"Pick a program and stick with it for ~2 months (including whatever deload scheme it uses). When you're done, ask yourself if you liked it, if you made progress, and if you still feel relatively healthy. You have to decide how you prioritize those 3 items.   If there were parts you liked and parts you didn't, try to identify a different program that emphasizes the parts you like. Do that for 8 weeks and then assess again.   One of the biggest parts of lifting as a lifelong hobby is figuring out what will make it a lifelong interest. "I want to get stronger" is a typical goal for a bunch of people, but there are a million ways to get there, and even if you use a "crappy" program that you really enjoy and get stronger with, then that's going to be better than some notionally optimal program you hate.   But if your primary goal is to compete in 6 months and that's truly what motivates you, look at weekly LPs for your strength level (e.g., Texas Method). On the other hand, if your primary goal is to compete because everyone says you should compete as quickly as possible, then is that really what motivates you, or are you just listening to what everyone who's been competing for years says is their motivation?"

WildStar,"TBH I remember playing DAoC (which had open housing) and getting my house once I hit max level and honestly is was the most dead area on the server. All you could do is manage the INSIDE. There was barely anything you could do with the "land" you were on other than foliage and decorations.   Let's take wildstar now,  you are getting a whole plot of land that you can put crafting tables, dungeon portals, training stations,  even freaking carousels on (to name but a few). That's not to mention the myriad of decorations you can add to the land alone. So there is a size/technical concern at that point.   Now let's talk about the other factor, the barrier of enter into the housing system.  That's when you say, "but Demidark33 whatever do you mean?" I'm talking about the fact that in DAoC only the Max level characters had houses mostly because they were the ones that could afford it.  Now in W* they are literally throwing the houses at people. By level 8 (I think they said) everyone will have their land.  That's a ton of people that they would have to find space for and lead to alot of people who might not be doing anything with the land getting plots. So then let's think about our cozy neighborhood, with a bunch of just empty/inactive plots, not fun...   Finally, lets touch on the dynamic events that are going to be happening at our house. I'm talking about tornado minigames, exploding mines, bandit raids and weather effects just to name a few. Now let's think about how laggy it would be to have a tornado is each of your neighbors yards, then add in a few telegragh minigames and someone is getting raided... You would never be able to move around.   All in all for what they are trying to do with housing and the ammount of customization they are giving you, instancing is the only method that makes sense to me. They are trying to cater to social people by allowing you to control what privileges people have and who you want to be able to come on your land.  I mean they are saying that your friends can come and do events for you and you both get credit, that's pretty cool."
WildStar,"In Guild Wars there were a LOT of titles, but they were tiered. An example would be gathering 'faction points' for your chosen side. If you had just started, you had the title "Luxon Supporter", but if you put the time (and I mean a lot of time) you could unlock the highest tier: "Saviour of the Luxons". These differences were most certainly noticed, and when you saw someone with a maxed out title it was definitely respected.   The number of available titles just means that people can acquire titles in many different ways. If they just want a funny title they can go out and earn that title. But if they want to show their skill, dominance or devotion to the game they can go and earn a really difficult title. In time, those titles will be known and renown and people will have that "awe" feeling when they seem them."
WildStar,"What I have seen as the general consensus is not to craft while leveling if you like money, and you can get gear just fine from questing.   However, as a tank or healer, by level 20 at the first dungeon you really want to be in full support gear, and you can't always keep up with that because not every quest reward gives you a choice, so crafting helps keeping 2 sets of gear up to date.   Also, I like to level through pvp and dungeons and find questing boring, so I won't be getting many quest rewards, see above.   If you plan on going straight dps, or not doing dungeons until later (which I don't reccommend because they help with learning mechanics) then ignoring crafting is fine."
WildStar,"I think the problem with this "soultion" would be that pug's would then only run bronze, 'cause someone will surely do the math and proclaim that doing a bronze run 3 times in the same timespan as one gold run is the most efficient way to get gear.   True, the completition rate would maybe go up, but then you'd have the same problem like in other games, where optional, good content is skipped because it's not hte best time/loot ratio.   And if you are not the tank and ask for extra bosses/objectives/what have you you get screamed at, or kicked...   People (at least pug's) will always ALWAYS go the way of least resistance   I think an option would be to, say, give the chance at epic loot on each level, and for extra objectives/bosses/better performance give more elder points or something on that line.   So the people who only want to grab the loot have a shot at it, even at bronze level, but for better performance you get more elder points.   But the greatest problem I see is the pug-community is clearly corrupted by all the easy give-aways from other games, an the time is money mentality, so you have to play for the best efficiency and not for fun."
WildStar,"I used to work at a bank, and realize sometimes charges (like gas stations, etc) will post twice to your account, (in the case of gas stations, a memo post of $1 or $75, depending on how the station is set up) will appear, then it may either drop off once the actual charge posts.  Sometimes the hold doesn't graciously drop off.  The only time to worry about it is when it is no longer a pending charge, but actually a line item on your statement.   What is unfortunate, with some of the new banking regulations in effect, is you now can't use a debit card to overdraw your account, even if you know it won't really overdraw your account because that is a errant memo post, unless you have that form on file that says "I'm aware I can overdraw my account with my debit card"   Some banks refer to the temporary hold as a "pre-authorization" or "memo post".  The actual post will be a "Debit" or "Check Card Debit" depending on which banking software they use.   Generally, a transaction won't move to a posted transaction until overnight processing, and that will generally only happen if they have settled the transaction after 3pm, unless you bank at a credit union, which doesn't believe in batch processing (from what I have experienced), those process immediately, which is great if you make deposits.   Now, if multiples hit after your next days business post, then its time to get NCSoft on the phone and asking questions."

mwo,"Contributing to the team" doesn't mean that your team is a good one. All it implies is that you act in such a manner as to help your team win. With proper explanation as to "How you would help your team win" would help much more than just throwing money at you for doing poorly.   Those "economy" fleas with 1ML teams won't be winning much, if at all. I have highly weighted "winning" over personal gain per match. Help your team win, win more often, gain much more money than "econ fleas"   Edit: Perhaps a Team Pool could solve the problem you propose. A team is given a flat rate of 160k to divvie up between its members, divided up into subgroups, including perhaps "Spotting Bonuses" totaling 20k, "Damage" bonuses totaling something like 50k, and Killing/Assisting totaling 90k, to be divided up based on how much you did with comparison to your team. For the 7 "econ flea" example, if you were to run an assault or LRM boat, the 7 "econ fleas" would divide up the 20k pretty evenly, you would get a large majority of the "Damage" pool compared to everyone else, and you would get a large portion of the Kill/Assist as well. Please note that this is a very rough example, and that numbers could be tweaked, new categories would be possible, different weighting, etc.   ;"
mwo,"While I disagree with a lot of your post (while for the most part I appreciate it's "heart"), there are only two parts that I can make a reasonable rebuttal at this time. The issue of the games instability at this time is one. To my knowledge, most people who are AFK any more are because of some sort of connection glitch/fps bug/didn't start the match with weapons/who knows what. Furthermore, I know a lot of people who this happens to more often than others. Because of this combination of factors, it seems that your manifesto would currently severely punish players who's hardware isn't playing nice with the engine. That's hardly their fault and it could cause some very soar players.   The other issue is that, while you say that the trial mechs are there specifically for no worry, I must admit that there are times when I simply am not a good pilot. And by that, I mean most of the time. I have my games, but really I am not great. Furthermore, I don't expect that I will ever be that great. I don't want to be forced into piloting only trial mechs because there is too much risk running my own to only take it out on special occasions. Just for clarification, I have been playing quite some time and at this point, I don't know how much better, I as a person can become. Maybe some of it has to do with the rather low fps and not quite high end enough computer to run it, but I think I also am just not enough of a "hardcore" player on a typical basis in order to really be awesome. Enough of the self bashing though, I know there are people worse than me, and there are people who will always be worse than me. I don't want them to feel like they shouldn't be playing the game either, just because that isn't going to change."
mwo,"It's ok so long as it's not spamming, once at start, once at end in my opinion is fine (same with streaming messages) but when the mechs are powered up and until the last mech drops I personally think it's just good manners to not post such messages as the focus should be on the action."

SimCity,"Of course it's intertwined, just not in the technical level. There're two things that've been made patently obvious so far: SimCity needs the servers for  region  play, and SimCity's gameplay was designed around  region  play.   "SimCity needs region play AND Region play needs servers => SimCity needs servers."   I bet you $10 that's the chain of logic Maxis used. From a gameplay design sense, it's quite obvious they weren't "shackled" with DRM servers by EA execs late in the development process. The game wouldn't've depended so much in intercity interaction if that'd been the case.   Note that even the article itself says it'd be a "minor engineering effort" to get an offline experience  without all the nifty region stuff . Which when you stop and think about it, includes some very fundamental things such as the ability to specialize your city.   That said they clearly failed in the execution stage. But just saying "Make it local single-player!" isn't gonna fix it, 'cause you're gonna cripple the game far more than disabling cheetah speed. (No excuses for traffic though)   The suggestions below about a loopback server could work, of course, until you stop and consider that every "server" is actually a whole cluster of EC2 nodes and stuff. 'course, you could scale down and adapt into a single-machine server, but  that  wouldn't be a minor engineering effort either."
Seattle,"the rejection of all authority seems ludicrous to me   Why?   >I feel strongly that people should be rewarded more for their contributions.   I agree. We do not need hierarchy in order to achieve this. You confuse commerce with capitalism. Owners are rewarded  more  than the workers, while workers are the ones doing the most contributing toward the success of the company. This is a backwards system in capitalist ventures.   >If you can organize and manage a gigantic corporation that ships products around the world, you should be paid more.   This is where you overestimate the value of ownership. Most owners have very little say in the success of their ventures. They merely had the capital to begin things. After that, it's up to the workers.   > Is it 'fair' that the owner gets a huge estate, vacation homes, and a corporate jet?   I'm glad you saw that it's "no". However it's not just slightly "no", it's a huge  NO FUCKING WAY .   >The service he provided by creating the company, however, far outweighs the outrage that anarchists feel when they think about how poor they are relative to him.   I find that this "service" is negligible. We don't need him at all once it is started.   >Authority, in its many forms, seems contingent to the emergence of greatness and virtue   Authority just holds us back from being able to realize our own greatness. It tricks people into thinking that they need someone else's permission to do something that they know is right. On this one can't disagree. There are those few people that are just plain dumb and can't do anything by themselves, but  more  people are far more capable of doing the right thing without being told to do it.   >States can marshall and maintain armies (...) don't get comfortable.   Just because we're anti-war does not mean we're pacifists. Some of us are, but they're the minority. Most anarchists are very pro-gun rights, are very comfortable with defending ourselves even with violence. I fail to see how armies are necessary. They only serve to further war, not prevent it.   Especially in America, we are more than capable of defending our home turf without the need of the US military. Every country in the world should be the same way.   >The modern era actually makes anarchy even harder to fathom when it comes to the latest methods of warfare. (...)warlords frequently have even less respect for human rights than states.   How is this any different than what we currently have? Please describe how George W. Bush is any different than an African Warlord... Because his military is stronger? Because his military wins? Compare everything with what these "warlords" do to each other in 3rd world countries with what the United States has just spent the past 11 years doing in the Middle East and Persia...   Same shit.   Different sounding name.   Obama isn't much better when it comes to his war record.   The existence of powerful nations make war terrible, it makes it a constant threat. Smaller nations constantly feel threatened by the larger ones. Other larger countries just escalate their armaments to compete against each other.   Look at how dangerous it became to be a human post WW2. There has never been a time in history when every single human on earth ran the risk of dying simultaneously. This happened because of two powerful nations trying to compete with each other.   Granted, now it's too late. Nuclear arms exist. But I'm actually fine with a rogue general with one or two nukes rolling around with the threat of using them over two (or the ten that we currently have) nations having thousands of nukes capable of ending all life on earth."
Seattle,"I'm not sure if revenue neutral is the right target here. I'm open to the possibility that below market rate pricing for car2go's parking permits might be reasonable. Nevertheless, something interesting is happening here.   Provided that car2go is capturing users who would otherwise drive a private vehicle (as opposed to capturing transit, bike, walk users), we're seeing a shift from one user fee to a different user fee. In other words,  something  in the price structure is resulting in people choosing to pay a la carte for the car, to avoid paying a parking fee.   EDIT:"
Seattle,"Obamacare will adjust Medicare so that more money goes to preventive care, but I don't find specific definitions for that, so I don't know if those qualify.  The medicaid changes will pay doctors more (which is good), and help more people who need it to qualify.  It is up to the states to decide if they will cover those sorts of medical expenses, and up to individual doctors to decide if they will accept it as insurance."
Seattle,"My Leroy's story I re-post every time I see a Leroy's reference or a suit buying question:   Long story.   Way back in high school in the mid 1980's someone told me an urban legend about Roger Mosley (aka TC on Magnum PI & had a bit part in McQ). The legend was that he was on the gameshow $25,000 pyramid. He and his partner got to the last stage where he would give clues and the partner/contestant would answer "Things that are  __ ." If the partner could guess enough right answers she would win the $25,000 prize.   Things are going swimmingly until they got to a clue and the conversation went like this:   Roger Mosley (calm): "Purple Suit"   Contestant: "Things that are odd?"   Roger Mosley (patient):"Purple Suit."   Contestant: "Things that are colorful."   Roger Mosley (less patient): "Purple Suit!, Purple Suit!"   Contestant: "I don't know. Ummm... Things that men wear?"   Time is now almost out.   Roger Mosley (exasperated and almost yelling): "Purple Suit!, Purple Suit! PURPLE SUIT!!"   Contestant: "I don't know, I don't know. Things that are bright?"   Buzzer sounds. The contestant doesn't win. The host comes over and decides to give the contestant a couple of clues just to see if the contestant could get the answer even though the money was lost.   Host: "A new car. A new house. A fur coat."   Contestant: "Things that are nice?"   Host: "Correct."   The host looks oddly at Roger and says: "Purple suit?"   Roger Mosley: "Where I come from there is nothing nicer than a purple suit."   Fast forward about ten years. The place that I work had a very successful year. Big year end party and it is made clear to me that I have to do "something very nice for the occasion."   So I spend about a week trying to figure out what to do. And then into my head the answer pops: "Well there is nothing nicer than a purple suit."   So off I go to find a purple suit in Seattle. I try Nordstrom, The Bon, The Men's Wearhouse. Not only does no one have a purple suit, but they all look at my like I'm an idiot for asking.   A couple nights after giving up my search and knowing that all is lost, I am rolling into the BP Gas Station right next to the Space Needle at 4AM after a Saturday night of having fun.   While I am gassing up my car a guy rolls up in a big Caddy. He is wearing a gray shiny shark skin suit and has three of his "ladies" in the car with him. He is obviously a player.   Me (Excitedly yelling like a dork at 4 in the morning): "Oh man I love that suit!"   Player (Jazz cool): "Thanks man."   Me: "You wouldn't happen to know where I could get a purple suit? I've been looking all over the city and all the shops just laugh at me when I ask them."   Player (Still Jazz Cool): "Oh yeah man. Go over to Lee-Roy Menswear over on Pike and 2nd."   Me: (Way too excited by the good news): "Oh hey thanks man. I really appreciate it."   That next Monday I go down to Leroy's (La-Roy's) Menswear. I walk in and look at the guy behind the counter and say: Me (very cautiously): "Would you happen to have a purple suit?"   Leroy (looking at me like it is a silly question. The exact same look as the other stores): "Well of course. We have several. And you have a body like a black guy. They will fit you great."   I then tell the story of the guy in the Caddy and the shiny sharkskin suit. Leroy says: "Oh yeah that is Willy T. Good customer. Big player."   The other thing I remember when trying on my grimace colored Nehru cut purple suit, was when I asked if should have purple shoes.   Leroy: "No way. That would make you look gaudy."   The suit was a huge hit. I was walking down the street in it and a lady slammed on her brakes, rolled down her window and yelled: "Damn white boy! You look great!" Without another word she drove off.   I went back and bought another one two years later. I'm still looking for that elusive shark skin dark purple suit.   My friends would invite me to their weddings with the stipulation that I could only show up if I wore one of my purple suits."
Seattle,"Ok, then the question remains.  Why charge 2x+ SeaTac commuters than the Tukwila commuters one station down?   Why change a system that, by and large, works?   You aren't going to find any allies here for raising the cost of public transportation.  Seattlites use the train a lot and what you are suggesting is helpful to nobody other than SoundTransit.  Honestly, I think this would just increase people's use of alternate transportation, which, in fact, would make it helpful to nobody at all."
Seattle,"The seattle freeze. Ah yes.   First, I don't think Seattleites are socially backward, that's just rude, I just think the makeup of the people who can survive in this city make for a strange confluence of social interaction.   Seattle, until the late eighties and early nineties, was a very blue collar city. With fishing, shipping, aerospace, and logging being the major industries in the area. The city was actually dying, there used to be a sign on 5 south that said "if you're last to leave seattle, please turn the lights off." Due to many circumstances (the ability to chave cheap energy due to hydro being one of them) the technology industries began to come to the city, bringing with them people relocating from the likes of southern california.   People who have spent their lives in southern california are uniquely unequiped to deal with living in the PNW. Used to sun and comfortable temperatures year round they discovered the need for flannel and discovered the pitfalls of Seasonal Affective Dissorder. There is a reason Grunge came from Seattle.   When grunge hit it big suddenly people from all over the country were looking to Seattle as the place to live. The dream of the 90's was born here, coffee culture, and academia took strong hold.   As the 90's progressed and the world woke up from it's heroin induced grunge phase the focus of the cultural zietgeist shifted, jumping from place to place for a while, and the non-committed seattleites left.   Meanwhile, the tech companies grow more and more bringing in people from overseas (generally east Indian) who move into the 'burbs adding yet another layer of culture to our fair corner of the country.   All this time those of us born and raised in Washington were raised in the manner expected in a place so close to Canada. As people moved into the area, meating locals, they realize that people are polite here, and adopt the same social norms.   Now we have a confluence of the old timers who worked in factories or other blue collar jobs, those southern californians who moved here and promptly holed themselves into their homes to avoid rain and tend to their SAD, aged hipsters who still atend live shows but didn't want to leave seattle for whatever reason, those local kids who were raised by locals and the above turning us into one of the fiercest hipster youths in the country, recent immigrants, and those people who have moved here because they like rain and clouds and natural beauty with their urban experience.   All of these people have one reason or another to not be friendly, they'll be polite to no end, but friendly does not come easily.   However, the youngin's are a whole new generation that's willing to be friendly, but you need to ptu yourself out there, make the first move. We're a different and quirky people, so go out, grab a micro, and plant yourself somewhere social."
Seattle,"As a native to the great state of Washington here is why we hate  outsiders.   1)  You have umbrellas, they look silly, they don't work well in the wind, they take up precious sidewalk space, and in 21 years of existence I have been hit by at least 4 flying umbrellas that I remember. Theres this thing called wind and it likes to ruin your shit, get a water proof jacket, or a set of testicles and flannel shirt.   2)  You bitch about the rain on days when I would say "Oh hey lets walk to  wherever  it's not really raining". Seriously. It gets on my fucking nerves. I can always tell you aren't from around here when you say "Is it raining?" and I say "No, not really anyway" and you respond "What does that mean? is it raining or not?" then I say "A light mist is falling from the sky" to which you say "Maybe we should wait for it to stop"   Guess what imaginary person!? I have places to be before 3 days from now when the sun will come out for five minutes. Shut the fuck up and lets roll you aren't the wicked witch, you aren't the alien from that god awful Shyamalan film where mel gibson plays a preacher turned atheist who gets his faith back! you're gonna get slightly damp, too bad we never invented indoor heating or laundry up in the pacific north west.   Understand that we native Seattlites have skin too. We can tell water is falling from the sky, oh well it's gonna be that way for a while. You bitching about it annoys us in the same way a repost of an image macro bitching about all the reposts annoys redditors.   3)  You bitch about the "Seattle Freeze" you can often get away with it because a lot of people are also non-natives like yourself. However imagine if I went to your hometown (I will be calling it amiseville) and kept saying "Man it's hard to make friends here everyone is so cold, they won't make eye contact, sometimes they act like they aren't even aware of me. Guess what they call them 'Amiseville Autistics'"   It's generally good taste to avoid stereotypes of the people who live in the area where you are trying to make new friends.  I wouldn't go to Texas and ask why everyone there was a racist fuck who was pro death penalty, and wanted to fuck their siblings (because it's not true and while douchebags would agree with me and think I was funny many people would realize that Texas like every other place on earth has dumb asses and smart people.)   Now, any fucking questions? Something other than "WHY ARE SEATTLE PEOPLE SO HARD TO BEFRIEND?" unless you are going to provide specific fucking examples."
Seattle,"personally, i think that as a city, Seattle is:     tech heavy and therefore less face-to-face   in a wetter and chillier region therefore more inside living   more left-y and so therefore less IN YO FACE   has crappy traffic and parking, so people stay put more     but thats just me.  and im also a transplant who never had problems meeting people once i stopped trying to meet people the same as when i lived elsewhere."
Seattle,"Woah yea I went to this place Pizza Margherita because I had like a $15 for $30 worth of food Groupon and I realized after growing up on sloppy ass pizzas I didn't like their dainty Neopolitan style.   Nevertheless, the Tutta Bella menu says that their pizzas are like 10-13$ so for two people going out to eat even if the food is bad that's only like 5-6 bucks a person so who cares."
TalesFromThePizzaGuy,"I'd say that being a regularly good tipper is the key to making sure you get your food first. The drivers that I work with will often double or triple orders if the run they are up for is a stiff, and then will either take that (their first delivery) last or just go in order if that first stiff is just a block away. Never tell the person on the phone that you have a "Big tip" because of two reasons: the insider taking the order might tell the driver, or the driver might be the one taking the order. The reason not to do this is because we've all heard this lame line before and it is almost never true. Oh, and if you order online and pay by credit card, don't think that a big tip on the card will make us rush any faster while in the store. Depending on the setup, we might not even see that tip until we're about to leave, which means that a driver might have looked at the run he was up for and thought "Eh, I'll just wait for another order to take with it." Reputation is the only way to ensure the best service, especially if it seems to be happening "far more often than it used to." I'd also say that maybe there was just something that changed at the store. We just got a new computer system that times us more accurately based on the suggested route. If we deviate from that route and the trip takes longer, the managers will know something is up. Just an FYI."
educationalgifs,"The relation is explained in this diagram](     A cos(蠅t) = blue   B sin(蠅t) = red   C cos(蠅t - 蠁) = green     A is the length of the blue segment, and B the length of the red segment. Therefore: C^2 = A^2 + B^2   The phase angle 蠁 is the angle shown in yellow, which is 蠁 = arctan(B / A) = ["atan2"](   This relation, which isn't always obvious to a lot of students, is useful when dealing with [phasors]( and it explains why you need both sines and cosines in a [Fourier series]( to specify an arbitrary wave form, since for that you need to encode the phase of each frequency component as well, in order to properly describe the total waveform.   So, for simplicity, complex numbers are used along with Euler's formula: e^(i&theta;) = cos(&theta;) + i sin(&theta;). With complex numbers, you can just wrap phase and amplitude of each component in a single number, Z = ( Ce^(-i蠁) ), and use e^(i蠅t) for the varying oscillation part: Ze^(i蠅t) = ( Ce^(-i蠁) )e^(i蠅t) = Ce^i(蠅t-蠁)   EDIT :  HERE'S A 3D VERSION! . Well,  not quite  3D, as I didn't add any z-sort to the lines. But you get the idea.   (I hate to watermark stuff I make, but I'm kinda making a living off donations at the moment, so forgive me for that. I just know this will go around. I'll probably make a proper post about this on my tumblr blog anyway.)   EDIT 2 / caveat : The 3D version works because we fix a value of C and change only the phase, so we get A = C cos(蠁) and B = C sen(蠁). This traces a circle in that static diagram I posted above, or an helix with increasing 蠁 on another axis (the 3D animation).   In this scenario, translation along the x axis (2D case) is equivalent to rotation along the 蠁 axis (3D case). This is what makes the animation work.   If you pick A and B arbitrarily and trace an elliptical helix in 3D, rotating it won't produce the same effect, because the helix looks like a wave with varying amplitude as it rotates. So it's not the same thing."
Metal,"Does anyone else think that a lot of nu-metal existed basically because it was the only "heavy" genera that played on the radio at the time?   I read a lot of these "getting into metal" stories, and I think of my own and it just seems back in the late 90s, a young lad seeking something heavy will only find bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc, because that's all that's on the radio, in the movies, and what his friends listen to as well. Magazines like Pit existed, but how is an 11 year old to find something like that if none of his friends know about it either? There was no downloading or metal forums to let me research heavy bands and introduce me to a wider variety of music. You know what took me from metallica an nu metal to the more extreme stuff when I was 13? Cannibal Corpse's appearance in Ace Ventura. Once I found out who they were and where to find them, it was the seed I needed to dive into heavy music that basically couldn't be found anywhere in a jr high schooler's life. From there the freedom of the internet pretty much helped me discover most of the rest... and is still doing so today."
Metal,"Maximum upvotes for the earplugs (1). The most underrated piece of concert gear. Screw any haters, if you wear them you are not a dweeb, you are being smart.   The volume at ANY rock concert is "too damn high". I don't know about the venue, but if it's like any metal concert I've been to, it's probably the loudest sustained noise you will ever experience, unless you work in an industrial environment.   The "dampening" or tinnitus you may experience after the show is temporary. Your hearing adapts to the sound levels. However, abuse of your ears causes permanent hearing damage which initially may be imperceptible but will gradually pile up over the years. You will start losing frequencies and you may get annoying permanent tinnitus - medicine can't do anything about it.   Everyone working there, unless already deaf (that includes technicians, musicians, etc) wears plugs because it saves their valuable sense of hearing and helps them hear the music instead of a jumbled wall of sound.   Musician's earplugs do not attenuate the high frequencies as much as regular foam plugs thus they are better for listening to music. May be slightly more expensive, but they can be cleaned and last a long time."
Metal,"Nu and core are part of metal, by definition. They evolved from it. You may not like it, but if you start saying they're not metal, you'll have to exclude Folk metal, Symphonic metal, SID metal, etc.... Basically anything that mixes it with another genre. Hell, there's an acapella band in Germany covering metal songs, they don't even have guitars and you would still consider them metal because of their sound.  Hard Rock on the other hand is part of rock, somewhere between Rock and classic Heavy Metal. The new wave of british heavy metal evolved from it, but it is generally seen as Rock."
Metal,"Metal is a type of heavy modern rock music derived from blues rock. It's primary instruments are electric guitars, drums and vocals. The guitars are drop and/or downtuned, and the drums and vocals tuned to match. The primary type of distortion used is overdrive, although further distortion effects can be used.   Tritones are common, as is atonality and dissonance.   The beat is not like those used in rock, or the suffled beats of jazz and blues. Blastbeats and similar complicated drumming is common, but not essential.   There is no specified rhythm, melody or tempo. Other instruments may be used.   Unlike in rock, there is a constant sonic assault. This combined with the beat, tuning distortion and type of chords used gives the unique heaviness.   Genres that only have only some of these characteristics are subject to extensive internet arguments; how many of these characteristics are required for a genre to be metal? Genres such as nu metal and -core and bands such as Tool and Karnivool do not have all of these characteristics. IMO, all of the above characteristics are necessary for a band to be metal."
Metal,"You can ask a dozen different metalheads that and get a dozen different answers, for all it's camaraderie metal is a very divisive genre. Perhaps that's because metal actually isn't that well defined.   As with most things in life there is black, there is white and then there is grey, it obviously very easy to distinguish between, say, Pink Floyd and Metallica as to which one is metal but the thing about music is it's ever changing, ever evolving and it has a tendency to cross genre borders. I guess a simple answer, though, would be aggression. Arguably that is metal's signature, it tends to be loud, fast, heavy and (on the odd occasion) dark but I don't think you can get much more specific than that, and this isn't unique to metal either this is the case with most genres (try having this discussion about prog rock etc.), but to try and define metal any further is to likely fall prey to a number of fallacies.   One notion I particularly dislike is that of "true" metal. I won't go into huge detail here but I would urge you, anytime you hear someone use that term (and not just for metal either), to view their arguments with suspicion. To say that any form of music is the "true" representation of any genre is both ignorance and arrogance of the highest order, there is no true representation of any form of music. All music, all genres have a genesis and then they evolve, they take influences from other genres, other styles and they adapt them (to varying degrees of success).   Metal's roots, as with rock, lie in blues. If you really wanted to you could argue that Robert Johnson is the godfather of metal, indeed, back in his day he was reported to have made a deal with the devil in order to get his guitar playing skills (how metal is that?) but I would be wary. In summary, metal is many things, different styles with different inspirations and no real clear definition. Just the way it should be."
Metal,"I see that most people are talking about the technical musical aspect of the genre here (And quite honestly I have no fucking idea what most of it means! :P)   Let me go on a different tack here and say that "heavy" is a FEELING, a quality that happens use the techniques, chords, song structure etc mentioned to get that FEELING across.   Lets take black sabbath, the band and song. That song is heavy as fuck, ozzy's wail, the sludgy guitars, the drumming, all add up to convey a sense of dread and forlornness. Me personally, I really lock onto that. It moves me. I find it heavy. It has a "metallic" sound. Heavy metal.   By the same token, let's look at Anthrax. Happy cheerful songs, but still aggressive. The riffs, drumming, joeys soaring vocals, frank's bass..gets me so fucking pumped. Once again, It moves me, it's heavy. Once again, Heavy metal.   Now we'll use the oft cited example in this discussion, Slipknot. Loud distorted guitars, thumping bass, fast drumming, harsh vocals..but they leave me flat. They may have a "metallic" sound, they may be hard, but they don't move me at all. I just don't find them heavy.  I can't really go into more depth about what I dislike about them, not least because i avoid listening to them but because I don't have the musical knowledge to properly analyse it. I don't know art but I know what I like I suppose.   Now I'll throw a curveball.   Go listen to pornography by the cure. It's a heavy album. I'd say it's equal to My Dying Brides as the flower withers. It's not a "metal" album by any stretch of the imagination, but fuck it's heavy. Gets me going where sipknot or pantera leave me totally flat."
Metal,"Speaking of Piece of Mind, To Tame a Land has such a great intro. I despise the verses though. Then when it transitions to the second section about 3 minutes in, it's better again, the guitar solos are pretty sweet. But that first section it like the Invaders Chorus to me."
Metal,"My, my. Someone got butthurt lol. That paragraph make you feel better? I'm the furthest thing from an elitist Lmao. But you wouldn't know that. You're just some idiot on reddit, who feels that he should be able to run his mouth and anyone who says anything in response that doesn't agree with what you had to say is a loser/faggot/insert insult here. You need to get over yourself, and remember that you're in a forum dedicated to metal. People are going to respond to your comments, and not all of them are going to agree with you."
realdubstep,"Just realized I posted this in the /r/dubstep thread but here is my response.   I don't think there is one person you can really point to. There's lots of big names who carved out individual styles. One of the biggest hallmarks of dubstep early on was that it could be almost anything you wanted it to be within a few guidelines half step about 140 emphasis on bass etc. So really I think it's a fools errand to try to anoint one person as the most influential.   Kode9 is obviously a big one, lots of vocals on tracks and done in a way I've never heard anyone else do.   Mala and Shackleton have both got insane percussion, although their music is very different.   Distance brought a lot of metal influences to the genre.   Coki showed just how ridiculous you can go while still being deep.   Vex'd brought breaks and dubstep together, keeping it very hard but still deep.   Then there's people like Neil Landstrum and Milanese who are often overlooked but really opened my eyes to what dubstep could sound like or indeed cannot sound like.   Then you can talk about Headhunter, Pinch, Appleblim, Plastician, Ramadanman, Untold, Joker, Randomer, Sukh Knight, The Widdler, El-B, Tes La Rok, Ital Tek, The Bug, DZ, Matty G, Kryptic Minds etc who all had major influences on the landscape.   There are some big names I've left out here on purpose to illustrate my point. Dubstep was/is a melting pot, there's no originator just a big movement of people exploring a new flavour of music that you can come at from many different backgrounds (reggae, jungle, garage etc). As such there is no most influential producer.   Even with Skrillex would he ever have started making what he did had it not been for people like Excision and Datsik (sorry I don't like this sound very much so they may not be as important in this sound as I believe) showing that there was a dirty side to be looked at with tunes like Swagger and Havoc?"
SuggestALaptop,"There are plenty of options :D   If you want something ultra portable for at school you can consider the 11" sager which has a 650m 2gb gpu by nvidia. It can play sc2 on ultra which is kinda beast for its size. [Check it out here](   HP has the dv6t and dv7t (15.6" and 17.3" perspectively) but to really get a whallop out of it, it'll be around ~1100-1200 with their 33% off coupon. Personally, they treated me like garbage so I won't ever go there, nor do I ever really feel whole hearted in the recommendation.   Again, I'm not too sure what your needs are to be honest, but [here is a good place to look](   There are plenty of resellers and custom builders, you can kinda figure out who works best for you by contacting them individually. I went with LPC due to them having the best communication to me and well, the best discount too :P   Only thing about a custom builder is they usually only do really expensive builds, just a heads up.   Hope this was helpful!"
Gunners,"Like others have mentioned, growing up in America means soccer takes a back seat to other sports like NFL, basketball, and Baseball. I was one of those kids who played soccer until 12 and just quit because I was more interested in traditional American sports like Baseball and especially Basketball because I was always one of the taller kids (6'5 as of now).   I've always considered myself one of the most knowledgeable about sports among my friends because everyday I was reading articles, watching highlights or games on tv. Well my Senior year of high school is when I started noticing soccer a bit. I made some friends who played soccer and watched it religiously. So I started to play pick up games with them, even though I wasn't good (still not) and was just the dorky tall token gringo with all the Mexican kids.   I've always been patriotic when the US national team plays regardless of the sport. So when the 2010 WC came around, I bled Red White and Blue. I'm certain that I'm not the only American here that can thank Landon Donovan with his [late game heroics.]( I was hooked after that. I went out and bought the Fifa 2010 WC game and played it non stop with my friends and online until I finally won it all.   Well the WC had passed, I was going away to college, and I thought I was coming down off my soccer fever. Well, luck be it, my half my hall were soccer fanatics. Mostly Barcelona (yuck!) fans. Well, I've always liked going against the grain (LA dodger and Laker fan living in San Diego), so I knew I had to pick a different team. Well my friends who I played pick up with back home were Man U and Chelsea fans.   And let me tell you this, I was DEAD CLOSE TO BECOMING A RED DEVIL! Scary right? I however, didn't want to be a front runner and decided to get fifa 11 for my PS3 and see what team I liked playing with. Well... I liked chelsea a lot, also Real Madrid because of how awesome CR7 was in that game, but my favorite team was Arsenal by far. They passed the ball beautifully and just had a great flow to them. I talked to my friends back home and they said Arsenal was their favorite team to watch aside from "Their team" because they had just a beautiful offense. So midway through the season I started waking up to catch Arsenal on some live streams.   And let me tell you, I was not disappointed. Arsenal was just damn exciting. RVP, Fabregas, and Wilshere just were phenomenal. I hadn't seen football  played that pretty ever. What put me over the edge though was the Champions league game 1 vs Barcelona. From that day on, I knew I was a Gooner for life.   Ever since then, I've been waking up at 5 AM to watch our Gooners play live. I have never regretted choosing this team, and as the more I learn about the club, its history, its players, and just the way they run things, I can say that I'm proud I fell in love with an organization that does things the right way, The Arsenal Way."
Gunners,"I seriously dont know, i wasnt really a football fan as a kid. But all of my friends were and they were all babling about Henry, Bergkamp etc and i had no idea what they were really talking about. So bought Fifa 05 and played it to get a better insight on football, players etc. Since then always sympathised with Arsenal but didnt really follow their games. Then when all these football streams started around the web, i first followed Lazio because of my national hero Goran Pandev :D. Whelp, came back to my sympathy Arsenal and havent really missed a game since the 09/10 season.   edit: Funny how football games are involved in this :D"
Gunners,"I'm just going to copy and paste a response I typed up in a past thread since it's easier.   > How can I think that?  Because I've seen Stan do this all before.  Stan is making a profit.  Whether he is maximizing his return on investment is another thing.  He is conservatively investing, ensuring some profit, albeit like you said not as much as he could be profiting if Arsenal were winning trophies.  That would require him to take a risk and invest more in order to receive a higher return.  But Stan doesn't do that.  He manages his portfolio conservatively.   > I'm only critical because I'm American and I've seen this all before.  I'm a huge sports fanatic and follow other American sports more than soccer/football.  I've watched him take over the Colorado Rapids in 04 (whose business relationships with Arsenal eventually got Stan's foot in the door to buy them also), the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche in 2000, making marginal investments in the St. Louis Rams in 95 and gaining full control in 2010.   > Growing up, the Colorado Avalanche were one of the most feared hockey teams (after moving from Quebec) constantly keeping and attracting top tier talent (who here remembers Sakic, Forseberg, Roy?).  They were always competing for Stanley Cups (equiv to the EPL Title) and often division champs.  They won the Cup twice, in '96 and '01.  Stan acquired them the season they won the Stanley Cup, but he had 0 influence on operations and players at that time, since all the foundation for winning was there already.  Since he's owned the team they've been in a gradual decline each season and now they're bottom feeders of the league, not even making it to the playoffs consistently.  They keep tinkering with youth development (sound familiar?) since it's a low cost option, but won't make the plunge to sign proven talent.   > The Nuggets have always been somewhat mediocre, even when Stan bought them in 2000.  They were fortunate enough to see a rise in success around '08 after they drafted one of the premiere players in the game, Carmelo Anthony, and matching it with a veteran, previous champion, Billups.  Anthony is an all star talent, constantly playing on the US team, and is an irreplaceable talent.  So what does management and ownership do when he asks for a longterm contract and expresses his frustrations about ownership not investing in a little extra talent to help push them over the top?  They trade Anthony away ALONG with their second best player, Billups, for cheap nobody players and draft picks.  The whole NBA world was shocked.  Now the Nuggets are mediocre again, coasting by and winning enough to be relevant but with no shot of ever winning an NBA title (never even in the conversation).  They even have a genius coach, George Karl, who has been coaching since the 80s and is always getting the most out of his team, but can't compete since ownership refuses to invest.   > The St. Louis Rams came together around '99 with stud talent like Warner and Faulk.  This is the year that they won the Superbowl.  Stan had little to do with the success of this team, as he was just a partial owner, but the former owner Georgia Frontiere did.  It's a similar story to the Colorado Avalanche.  He gradually invested and came to own the team, with fuller ownership being reached in 2010.  And how has this team gone over the years?  Just like the Avalanche, gradually downward, from constant contenders to laughing stocks.  This team also mimics some of the troubles the Nuggets saw in not being able to appease their star talent.  Steven Jackson has been the premiere running back/player for the St. Louis Rams for years.  Arguably one of the best running backs in the NFL for years.  So how does ownership treat him this year?  They cut his playing time and toss him to the side for literally a first year rookie, Darryl Richardson.  They can't take care of Jackson either and negotiate a contract extension, even though Jackson has pledged his loyalty to the club, even through the dark years when he carried their franchise.  Instead, Jackson, who was suppose to have a year left with the Rams, is now let go going into next season and has to find a new club.  Rams haven't made the playoffs since 2004 btw..   > This is why I'm critical of Stan.  I've seen him do enough to take profit from all his clubs, but never make the big/risky moves to either attempt to win it all or maximize his profits.  He'd rather always take the sure thing then go for more.  I've watched this guy ruin every sports club he's touched (besides the Colorado Rapid winning the League Cup in 2010).  So excuse me if I'm a little fearful of what is going on with Arsenal.  I don't want to see this beautiful club meet a gradual decline over the years.   >"
Gunners,"I've watched every game he has played since the World Cup. Since the transfer he has played better than I expected. He has integrated more of the way he plays for the German NT and is  trying  to figure out how to play more defensively, which has always been his greatest weakness. He hasn't had a dip in form from my perspective. I'll quote myself from 2 months ago...   >And I'll just go ahead and predict that someone will say he has 'disappeared' in 90% of the games he plays for the rest of the season.   All the complaints about him in here mirror the exact complaints about him at Madrid. It's unsurprising when many were expecting a highlight reel spectacle in every game. That was never going to happen. And it won't even happen once he 'settles in'. He already looks way more comfortable than I thought he would. He's a team-player and won't thrill you guys the way you want him to without the rest of the team being on the same page.   I've been spoiled, as I expected far more immediate frustration with the PL (which I'm new to watching because of 脰zil). I still don't think things will truly take shape for a season or two with money available and potential future signings. I don't think you guys should worry that 脰zil regrets his move. I haven't seen him play with this much enthusiasm in years. He's happy."
fantasyfootball,"Right but realize you have the same medium reward of both players in this matchup. If they both perform up to their respective optimistic projections they will basically be even. However the risk associated with each player is drastically different. If you get a bad performance out of Freeman it's decidedly mediocre whereas when Sanchez does poorly it turns into a "when it rains it pours"."
fantasyfootball,"40 Minutes til kickoff and I'm freaking out.   Standard Scoring, 2WR 1 Flex   Wes Welker @Jax Roddy White @ Det Lance Moore @ Dal Stevan Ridley @ Jax   I have Sid Rice, Greg Jennings and Kenny Britt on the bench but I don't think they can fit into my lineup.   Roddy's hurt, but not injured. Does he pull off a big TD or do JJ and Gonzalez see all the action? Welkers hurt...but not injured. Does he see the bulk of Brady's TD passes when they beat jacksonville 7834 to 3 or does Lloyd and Hernandez steal the spotlight? Is it inevitable that Ridley gets to run the ball up and down the field once NE is up by 7831 after the first quarter or will Bellicheck not trust him on the field quite yet? Lance Moore has been my BOY all year long, secret weapon all the way. Looks like Romo and Brees are gonna have a good old fashioned shoot out show down, think my main man Moore will explode?"
fantasyfootball,"Megatron & Jones are just no brainers. Both easily top-5 WRs (although too bad this isn't PPR).   Given that it's 6pt passing TDs, QB makes a little more difference than a standard 4PT passing TD league. I'd def keep RG3.   With 12 teams each keeping 5 players, a lot of RBs are going to be gone. And WR is super deep this year. I'd keep Ridley over CJ.   One spot left, hard to go wrong picking between Bryant & Thomas. I'd lean Bryant, because Welker should eat a little bit into Thomas' numbers this year.   Alternatively, you could throw Bryant back (again, since it's not PPR), and keep Kaep. In a 12-team league w/ 6 pt Passing TDs you might be able to trade him to another team for a good RB.   Draft a RB w/ your first pick!"
fantasyfootball,"Honestly, I like the way you're thinking, but the team you've drafted is probably not very good.  I tried doing Calvin/Jimmy for my first 2 picks in a mock the other day, and I got a similar result.  You can get away with getting someone like Calvin or Jimmy, but take both and you're in a bad spot.  In rounds 3 and 4, you'll be stuck staring and tier 3 running backs (Wilson, Ball, etc), and you'll also be seeing extremely solid wideouts like Andre Johnson and Roddy White, which you can't take because you need to reach for a risky running back."
fantasyfootball,"As a skins fan, I hope he comes back as good as ever. As a realist, I'm pretty skeptical about his ability to perform as both a runner and a passer. That being said, week 1 vs the Eagles is as good a time as any to start the entire redskins offense. With what you have, I like B Marshall over AJ Green, THIS WEEK. V Jax will most certainly beat decker. J Charles and AP could easily be a wash, this week. And I'm pretty certain you'll have a good week at TE. So, it comes down to your points from gar莽on and Morris being significantly higher than your opponent gets from roddy white and Daryl Richardson, which isn't impossible. Don't count yourself out just yet. I hope you make it... Skins winning week one will make me happier than winning any of my fantasy leagues lol."
fantasyfootball,"That's kind of fucked up. You shouldve counter offered something fair and explained using the past 4 weeks points as references why it was imbalanced and why this is a better deal.   Like just done forte for Lynch.   You are risking just turning them off of the whole thing forever. Which I know would've happened to me if I had an asshole uncle.   Chess as an example : is it a better way to teach someone to play by explaining moves and strategies carefully, giving them chances to capitalize, or by just running the foolsmate(2 move checkmate) on them for 4 straight months.   Exactly"
fantasyfootball,"No. Naw man. Nawwwwwwwww man. Not a chance.   Why? The split will probably end up more like 225/150/50 in rushes, but Gio is probably going to get 70-100 targets in the passing game to go with it where I would be surprised if Hill gets 10."
fantasyfootball,"You know, I'd be willing to bet that a large number of the huge guys in the NFL have used HGH to recover from injuries faster. That's typically what it's been used for in the past, and its effects aren't as blatant physically as other types of steroids. Big guys with a lot of pressure on their ligaments and joints can definitely benefit largely from having a bit of extra lean muscle surrounding those joints and ligaments to aid them in returning."
fantasyfootball,"Russ Willy   Haha, it reminds me of the two valet guys in Key & Peele who have their own nick names for movie stars, like Melly Gibsons.   But yes, Tony Romo,  ON PAPER , has an outstanding match-up and chance to put up 20+ points:     The Saints defense:   The Saints are allowing 278 yards/game, putting them 29th out of 32 teams.  They're allowing 7.5 yards/attempt, ranking 21st.  They're 23rd in QB-rating allowed at 97.7 -- and that's only because they've only allowed 4 passing TDs against zero INTs.   Again, the Saints are allowing close to 280 yards per game through the air.     Saints' Competition:  Yes, Matt Ryan torched New Orleans in Week 1.  In Week 2, the Saints faced the "mighty" Browns, who had Brian Hoyer and Johnny Manziel combining for 24/41, 202 yards, 1 TD and 0 INTs.  But last week the Saints faced rookie Teddy Bridgewater for 2/3 of the game, and he finished 12/20 for 150 yards and 0/0 TD/INT.     Shootout Potential:  As we know, if there's a SHOOTOUT, the QBs and WRs are the big winners.  Saints vs. Cowboys?  All indications are that it will be an absolute shootout, in which case Romo would be airing it out 35-40 times.  Assuming a modest 7.5 yards/attempt -- which also happens to be the Saints' YPA -- that's  at least  about 260-300 yards on 35-40 attempts.     Romo's Competition: First of all, Romo has arguably had the toughest schedule so far for QBs, since TEN, STL, and SF are ranked 2nd, 5th, and 13th, respectively, in pass yardage allowed.  Ironically, he has actually performed  better  against the top defenses.   You would think that Romo would struggle against the first two but perform well against SF.  NOPE!  Against #2 Tennessee, Romo went 19/29 with 1 TD, 0 INTs, 176 yards.   Against #5 St. Louis, he went 18/23, 217 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT.       So,  against the two top-5 pass defenses , Romo has combined for 37/52 (an amazing  71.2% completion percentage ), 393 yards, 3 TDs, 1 INT for a  104.08 QB rating  -- and these his two most recent games, showing momentum.   Bottom line/"
fantasyfootball,"Seriously, I am on your bandwagon sir.  He had an absolutely shit night, I started him and literally got ZERO points for his stats, but he will be back next week and I assume he will be back to his numbers of last week.  Guy is amazing, he is just freaking out over all the media hype.  Redskins play the Seahawks next week, Seahawks will now be favored by 37 points and Cousins will play to his opponents level.  Give it a week, all the media outlets will be back on the Cousins bandwagon...   PS: I have ZERO faith in the Giants being "back"...  Eagles are amazing and BARELY beat the skins, Giants suck a turd and Eli looked like last years Peyton.  First three weeks of football have been a clusterfuck, I do not expect that to change anytime soon...   EDIT:  Forgot a word"

You clearly aren't a Patriots fan, or don't watch a lot of Pats games. This couldn't be further from the truth. BB couldn't care less about a "hot hand" approach. He gameplans every week for the opponent. If he thinks a defense has a good front and a weak secondary, he'll have Brady throw 50+ times (See: denver). If it's a good secondary and a weak front, he'll run 40+ times (See: Indianapolis)."

fantasyfootball,"If A. Johnson is out, I think DeAndre has a chance to put up some good numbers again. Benjamin should be fine so go with him. For me it comes down to Gordon vs Matthews. I'd say go with Gordon since he's the clear cut uncontested no 1. Maclin could come back to elite status any game. I haven't closely followed Lafell in recent weeks but it's a tough matchup and he's competing with Gronk for TD targets."

AndroidQuestions,"If IT is reimbursing you for your phone, and you will be storing corporate data on it, they have a stake in it's security.   Any web app or application can have it's transmissions snooped on, and it gets easier depending on how you connect your phone to the internet (cafe wifi, for example, will be much easier to snoop on than 4g).  Because you are potentially storing sensitive corporate data, and they are paying for part of it, they should have a reasonable ability to control it's operations in the event that it gets lost or stolen.   For a web app, like owa, you are authenticating in one of three ways.     typing username and password   cookie from recently entered UN/PW   using your browser to save credentials.     because these 3 methods don't have access to your device IDs, your device IDs cannot be used to salt the password before hashed and transmitted.  (Read: easier to impersonate you in the event you lose your phone).  Method 1 also opens you up to a phishing site.   On the other hand, an app that uses activesync like GOOD will encrypt and store your password, and then use your device IDs to salt the password before sending.  This makes the transmission more secure (because they cannot intercept the data and figure out what your password is without the salt) and also leaves a single point of stored data, that IT is capable of remotely destroying in the event that you lost your device.   A saved password in chrome, however, they may not be able to destroy."
AndroidQuestions,"The difference between 5 and 5.3 V won't make any difference.   The current supplied, as listed on the charger, is the maximum the charger can provide. The phone determines how much current it wants to pull, but it expects at least 0.5 A (500 mA) to be available. All USB chargers will provide at least 500 mA.   In other words, if it is USB you don't need to worry about volts or amps.   The quality of the charger is a different issue. The two main issues are safety and noise. A good charger has safety features to prevent the charger and/or your phone from blowing up. SOME cheap chargers skimp on the safety features. A good charger also has filtering to eliminate noise. MANY cheap chargers skimp on the filtering. Without filtering, noise gets through and interferes with the touch screen as you have experienced. The battery will still charge, but touchscreens are very sensitive to noise and may not work right."

These are in addition to/start before the buzzing/wave occurs."
LucidDreaming,"I agree completely. I just started documenting my dreams a little over a month ago and within the first week of documentation my dream recall had noticeably improved.

gardening,"Not necessarily...  Plants are finicky organisms that can't talk and tell you what's wrong.  Depending the book you look at and the person you talk to, there are anywhere between something like 13 and 18 essential plant nutrients.  Within the plant, nutrients can be either mobile or non-mobile.  Nitrogen is a mobile plant element, being used in amino acid biosynthesis and essential to the chlorophyll molecule.  Magnesium is also a critical element in chlorophyll.  These both are mobile.  When the plant is lacking mobile nutrients, they take them from the older tissues and put them where they are needed.   On the other hand, the non-mobile nutrients show signs in the new growth, as the plant cannot move these elements around.  Many elements become bound in cell membranes, and cannot be transported.   Many times when lots of leaf tips are burnt, this could also be a nutrient toxicity, too hot of fertilizer, or too much fertilizer.   It is always a good idea to consult a deficiency manual or guide to help diagnose a particular issue.  A lot of the time though, pH is the number one thing that is off that causes deficiencies.  Unfortunately, a lot of the time when you want an answer for a cause in plant sciences, you get a 'Well, it depends...' and it does, on many variables."
gardening,"That's not entirely true. Only wood sold recently, and directly through consumer-based stores like Home Depot and Lowes, sell non-arsenic preserved wood. Chromated Copper Arsenate (CCA) treated lumber can still be purchased at lumber yards. They are exempt because they primarily sell to contractors who are supposed to know where CCA lumber can and can not be used, according to EPA rules set forth in 2004.   Identifying non-CCA lumber is fairly easy; it "shall be brown in color so as to distinguish it from current or previous manufacturing and preservation methods", according to the same rule. If you've been to Home Depot in the last few years, you've seen the dark-brown pressure-treated wood. It's usually marked "CA-C"   The dark brown lumber is treated with copper ethanolamine, and a small amount of formaldehyde. You decide if you want to eat it, but I can at least give you this:   The copper is not bound as strongly in CA-C lumber as it is with CCA, especially in the presence of acidic soil. This means not only does the copper dissociate into cupric oxides, it also leaves ethanolamine to leach into the soil. Here's some fun reading about it:   My concern is that the wood the OP used does not appear to be dark brown. Perhaps it once was, but if so, that just further demonstrates that the preservative is decomposing.   I'm sure the guy at Home Depot told him it was safe. I mean, what do I know? My degree in chemical engineering pales in comparison to the 10-minute pep talk the guy at Home Depot got from a lumber company rep.   Conclusion? Use redwood. The cost is the same as pressure-treated wood, and it's grown right here in the US. It's sustainable, supports jobs here in the US."
surfing,"Are their board rentals nearby?   I have no idea about that area specifically, but I would take boards. From my experience, it's too hard to find a good board when you travel, and you will want a good board if the waves are good (which they probably will be).

It's basically a hill on top of a hill, so you can choose to either go from the top of either depending on how fast you want to go. I only started going from the very top a few weeks ago, and by the time you hit the bottom of the actual hill itself, you're going anywhere from 60-70 kph. It was probably around 10 or 11 o'clock at night (which is necessary to minimise the amount of traffic on the roads) and after a quick warm up bail, I decide to start going from the very top. Between the first few runs, some locals had shown up and created a temporary blockade at the bottom of the hill as it ends at a t-junction. We didn't know them and they wholly did it of their own accord. Shortly afterwards, more people had shown up to the point where I had a miniature crowd watching me throw myself down this hill - hoping that I didn't get hit by a car. A method we came up with for riding the hill safely was to yell to a spotter as you hit the bottom of the first hill and for them to do either one of two hand signals to let you know if it was safe to pass or not. If a car was coming, he'd let me know and I'd slide to stop. I tried to keep my voice as quiet as possible when yelling to the spotter so that we didn't disturb or wake any of the residents. Around an hour and 4 runs later (it's a pain to walk up), I decided that I wanted one last run. As I was walking to the top of the hill, I had an elderly gentleman walk up to me and asked politely to finish up due to the noise. I apologised respectfully and asked if he would allow me to do one more run. He agreed, and left me to walk up the hill. Not more than a few houses later, somebody walked up to me and shined a torch in my face. I figured it was one of the kids who had been watching me and faffing about. Here's roughly how the conversation went: Guy: "Right m8. You better fucken' stop this skateboarding shit right now cos me fucken' dogs are barking. You may think you're not causing any trouble, but you are." Me: "Sorry for being loud. This was actually going to be my last run. Would you mind if I did it?" Guy: "No! You can go from here... and if I fucken' catch you out here again, I'll give you a taste of this proceeds to pull out a taser and sparks it for my benefit" In retrospect, I guess I should've been shocked. The one thing I found difficult was just to contain my laughter. I don't know whether it was his voice, appearance, or just the fact that I'd been threatened with a fucking taser, but it was absolutely hilarious. I chuckled and said "Alright. Calm down, dude. I'll finish up." There were so many things I wanted to say to the guy, but I suppose I didn't really want the situation to escalate to the point where I'd have to use my longboard as a bogan basher. Unfortunately I had left my GoPro at the bottom of the hill to get some footage of my coming through the intersection when this happened. I would've loved to have gotten it on film."
longboarding,"My town was actually featured in an SNL segment because of this. St George, Utah.   I went to the city hall and people were dancing out in front of it, it was great. City hall changed it IIRC because 2 people were break dancing outside of a building, and the police came and ticketed them. They went to city hall to argue over the fine."
GolfGTI,"Maybe not exactly an answer to your question but something worth considering:  The tough thing, in my mind, about that sale is finding reasonable comparisons to set your price.  I'd guess that's more than double the miles of the average 2010.  I'd also say, intuitively (and downvote me to hell if you must), a GTI should take a heavier depreciation hit for high mileage than the average car."
engineering,"I'd disagree (in part). This post seems to me to be rife with condescension. Paraphrasing, by saying "occupy the lab; occupy the library", lmc6d9 is saying that OWS protesters wouldn't be struggling or have issues to protest if they had made the same decisions he did.  And, to an extent, he's right....or at least, I can identify. I did the same thing. I went to a school I could afford. I worked at least part-time every semester. If I wasn't at work or asleep, I was at school. But, not everyone has the abilities and good fortune necessary to complete a technical degree. And OWS isn't directly protesting unemployment.   For as smart as this guy  probably is, he's not seeing the whole picture....which I believe is what Thereminz was trying to point out. Just because lmc6d9 is succeeding more than most doesn't mean there aren't very real problems of corruption, injustice, and inequity.   Hard work and good fortune are great and all but they won't keep people from abusing their power and taking advantage of others."
engineering,"It's not a matter of "can't" it's a matter of "wouldn't". I can almost guarantee that if, hypothetically, building another pyramid were to come up in a serious conversation with an engineering team, the question of "why" would be a tough one to answer compared to a lot of other design solutions. "Because it looks cool" doesn't carry a lot of weight, especially when you factor in the cost, time, and use of resources."
engineering,"The beauty of science is you can learn a lot without even going to an institute. As an example, most of the content at MIT undergrad is publicly available (helped me through my math courses for Chemical Engineering when your profs aren't all invested in the students).   Do you actually want to do this as an occupation or do you just want to know about it? If its the latter just start taking courses (coursera.org is a good location to start for free ones) and you can build your knowledge that way.   However, if you want to do engineering as an occupation you'll need to go to a university of some sort. Maybe consider doing it in another country so you can get your travelling thirst quenched at the same time (and maybe save a bit of money depending on where you would otherwise go to school)."
engineering,"Then you should know you won't be doing any engineering in the classical sense of design or planning. I'm speaking specifically about the army, but other branches will be structured similarly. (Maybe not the Navy, they are a more technical bunch, but in general)   If you enlist, you could learn a particular trade related to mechE such as welding, buuuuut, you won't learn much engineering past the basics to do that task.   If you get commissioned as an officer in the engineer branch, instead you MAY do some project management such as resourcing and coordinating for the unit to build something. Again though, no mechanical engineering specific stuff. Some officers down the line will get a chance to practice their engineering skills, but it's so far down the career path, that you don't want to join just for that. And it's also possible to be on that career path and still not get to that position.   It might seem odd, but for as much technical work the military does sometimes, the guys in the military don't ever see any of the engineering behind it. Joining military service is HUGE commitment and it WILL change your life. You should not join unless you've given it a lot of thought and talked to a LOT of people.   I remember being a high school senior and being both gung ho about joining the military as well as studying engineering. Looking back now I realize that I didn't know all that much about either. It's good that you have an idea what you want to do, but being 17-18 it's hard to grasp in your head what either profession does because you simply haven't had that exposure or experience to see it. I'd be happy to explain more in detail if you'd like."
engineering,"Military and civilian engineer here, I'm in the Army Reserve, I'm actually on a special team, called a FEST-A, that develops, plans, manages, and controls construction projects for an engineering battalion.  If you are in college I'd wait til you finish graduation and look into OCS/Direct Commission.  But right now, there's too many LT's out there it seems.   If you just straight join the military, your chances of doing anything engineering related is slim.  MOS 12T is about the closest to actual civilian engineering-wise, but it's more civil engineering and surveying.  There's a few MOS's (jobs) in 92-series that are maintenance and shop managers, but as an officer, you won't have much hands-on time."
engineering,"As for my official job title I am still a Technician Level 1, so yea I am not a manager at least on paper. So about 4 month after I started as tech I was tasked with handling anything quality control related. There are only 7 people in the company at that point so I was really the only person in Quality Control. My job was to try and get our contract manufacture, at the time, to stop sucking and make sure we did not ship their mistakes on to customers. Then a nice flood took out their building with a nice chunk of our part and hardware for our product they were building. The CEO/owner said screw lets just do everything ourselves. So we moved to a bigger building hired some more people and I was told hey you are now the manager for our part production. So I spend my time trying to schedule our techs to run 24hours a day 5 days a week, figure out where the hell is our raw material, why assembly is apparently having so much trouble with our parts and demanding we re-manufacturer all half of the part we gave them when it was them doing it wrong. (Those parts are press fit for a reason and not meant to just go on by hand....hence the press that is sitting right there for you to use). So I have the responsibility of a manager and all of the blame get passed to me if our parts production falls behind or whatever the problem of the day might be, yet no job title to go with it. Also since I originally comment it is now up to 5 people that I have to manage and the reason I used the word coworker is that we all have the exact same job title, still."
startrek,"Let me tell you about the Borg. No-one knows where they come from, what their origin is. Any trace of their history beyond a few thousand years in the past is completely inaccessible.   They're probably native to the Delta Quadrant, but no-one knows for sure. They might even be extragalactic in origin, or come from a different timeline or universe entirely.   We  think  that they organize themselves under Queens, but the details are not well known. For all we know the hive-mind could have been fucking with Picard and Data throughout First Contact. They are a truly inhuman intellect, with a "body" spread across thousands of star systems and millions of worlds.   No-one knows just how many Borg drones there are, but their absolute lower limit numbers in the trillions - probably many, many times that.   The only thing we know for certain is that their stated goal is to assimilate the biological and technological progress of other species to theirs.   Despite their undeniably powerful ships, they have never sent more than a few ships at a time to attack the Federation. A single Borg cube devastated the Federation fleet at Wolf 359, and another very nearly broke through the best defenses the Federation could muster to defend Earth.   In either case, had the Borg sent two cubes, or a dozen, or a hundred, humanity would have been overcome and assimilated. No question about it. In fact, the only species we've seen pose a significant threat to the Borg was the Undine - and they are the dominant race of what is essentially a pocket universe.   In short, if the Borg wanted to destroy the Federation, the KDF, every dominant race in the Alpha Quadrant, they could. If they wanted to assimilate every sentient being from Earth to Qonos, it would take them a matter of years on the outside, maybe as little as months or weeks if things went well.   This leads to the conclusion that the Borg do not  want  to destroy the Federation or its neighbors. They attack worlds and assimilate ships or colonies, but never seriously press an attack against Earth.   The Borg are not an implacable enemy, a foe reaching inward to snuff out the heart of Starfleet. They are a farmer harvesting a ripened crop. They "threaten" humanity, spurring cultural and technological development, and then reap the rewards every time they assimilate a Federation ship or acquire new drones.   Perhaps they've done this many times in the past, sending out a token force; if the force is not repelled, then the culture was obviously not strong enough to be worth nurturing, and will provide a useful source of drones. But if that expedition is forced back, token as it may be, then the Borg know that they have found a source of possible value, a seed that can grow into a worthy source of innovation."
startrek,"Personally, I think one of the main reasons that this is occurring is because long-time fans of the franchise and new fans of the franchise have a difference in their collective knowledge regarding the various series.   Speaking as a relatively new fan of the franchise (I was introduced to TNG as a kid, but I didn't become a big fan until recently), I feel intimidated freely discussing my thoughts on this subreddit because I assume that most of the people here have been fans of the franchise for quite some time. I figure that most people here already know far more about the franchise than I do, and if I were to bring up a question or make a comment, it would either be an idea which has already been expressed before, or it would be quickly dismissed by someone more knowledgeable than I am on the subject. I feel stupid looking at the weekly episode discussion even if I have seen the episode (I've only finished TOS, TNG, and the first three seasons of DS9) because on the occasions when I have read that thread, others have already made far more interesting comments about the episode than I could have ever thought of.   While I used to just pass this off as me being insecure about coming off as stupid in front of strangers, I can't help but think that other new fans feel similarly. I've seen a lot of "where should I start?" threads on this subreddit recently, and I think it's because a lot of people are like me and are trying to get into Star Trek either because of the reboot or because of the availability of all the series on Netflix. Regardless of the reason, there are a lot of fans who I think would like to participate in discussions, but they either feel intimidated by the thought of expressing their ideas in front of people who they feel are undoubtedly more knowledgeable, or they are afraid of having something spoiled that they haven't seen yet. For example, I found out about the death of at least one or two characters on threads that I figured would be spoiler-free. Obviously, that's the risk you're taking when you read a thread, I realize, and I can't expect everyone to not spoil anything (how could you have a discussion about certain topics without any spoilers?). Nevertheless, it does make me not want to read the threads regarding actual episodes/characters/series/etc.   Which brings me to the point you've made; many of the most-upvoted posts end up being Star Trek merchandise of some sort. I think this is because this is something that regardless of our involvement with the franchise, we can all agree on. If we like somebody cosplaying as one of our favorite characters, it doesn't matter if we've been a fan for a year, or for fifteen years, because we can upvote it and like it all the same. I think that's also why the reboot has been talked about so much in recent posts. "Into Darkness" is coming out relatively soon, and it will put us all on a level playing field again. Because this is new canon for all of us, we can all make our own decisions about what is good and what is not and what statements they're trying to make in the film and so forth. I realize that people who have seen TOS will have a slight advantage over those who have not in these discussions, but with as much as Abrams has changed in the reboot (and with as much as he likely will continue to change) I don't think most people will had to have seen TOS to make interesting points and observations about "Into Darkness".   Of course I realize this is all my take on things, and I could be completely misrepresenting new fans. I'm also not saying that there shouldn't be discussion of episodes/ideas/etc. in this subreddit. On the contrary, I'd love to see more of them. I've just tried to explain why I think many people aren't getting more involved in the discussions. If the problem really is that new fans aren't stating their opinions because they are intimidated or worried about spoilers, perhaps there is something we could do to ease their minds about those things. I think that new fans could really offer a different perspective on some things and could potentially generate a lot more discussion if they felt comfortable doing so. I'd really like to feel like a more productive member of this subreddit, but I'm usually too nervous to do so."
startrek,"Be warned with respect to TNG - the first season is nearly unwatchable.  I was a friggin'  hardcore  trek fan long before TNG ever hit the airwaves and it was so disappointing I didn't watch again until season three.   Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised by the turnaround in quality.  Season one isn't all bad, there are (maybe) half a dozen semi-watchable episodes but things get better in season two (The Measure Of A Man, for example)"
breastfeeding,"Thanks! It's really hard when you feel people are against you, we had just come home and he still had high jaundice, they had strong armed me in the hospital to add formula after nursing because my milk hadn't come in yet. I refused to give him more than 10-15ml of formula because I knew it would compromise my breastfeeding. He spit most of the formula up anyway so I don't even think he got much of it at all. My milk came in on day 3 so I promptly hid the formula and refused to use it. Bought a nipple shield to dull the pain because he was lip tied(didn't know it yet, but he tore me up). I'll never forget those words that made me shut everyone out that day "you should give him formula, he's not being satisfied by you". From my own mother. She was here to support me, even was able to make it to the birth because her plan landed the day I was induced. I just felt so betrayed. (Dramatic I know, but after the nurse in the hospital not being sympathetic about taking my son to the UV box I was on edge already). She just kept talking about how he shouldn't be wanting to nurse so much and he's not satisfied and eventually convinced my husband of it. She had no idea how breastfeeding really is because she was from the formula era, and the hospital told her I was "allergic to breastmilk" as a baby. It's not the worst thing that could happen to a mom that wants to Ebf but it was pretty disheartening to me at the time.   Lol sorry, it's still something that gets under my skin because now she asks if "you  still  breastfeeding that baby?" Yes. Yes I am.   Bahaha sorry, it always makes me rant when I go back and think about it. I'm done I swear!"
Animewallpaper,"Yeah, but there are few anime that actually achieve what the manga did. Mysterious Girlfriend X is another good example.  The short 12 episodes totally skipped all but the most important chapters, and the connection with the characters is no where close to the manga. Well, I need to stop my rant. thanks for listening haha"
ar15,"LOL Your time in the Army?  You must be like a fresh out of boot because everyone rocks an Aimpont of EOtech/ACOG.  A red dot it always going to be faster/more accurate than irons.  Just get magpul MBUIS and lay them down.  In the event of your tactical operations as an operator and your strike fire dies, just take it off and flip up the irons."
TheWarZ,"we followed this guy who looked like he had nothing. he went around a tree, when we walked up he unloaded with an m4. his hands were literally empty until that point, small backpack. fucker was packing 3 rifles, 3 pistols and a shotty, lots of ammo."
TheWarZ,"We shot this with a guy with nothing, didn't know he had nothing and if we could see we wouldn't trust them not to be hiding it, over local he talked nicely after his death.   We said come back and we'll guard you until you get enough loot for the road, he was back a few minutes late and started looting food and water.   I saw a guy approaching the airfield from the north and our friend was in the second small hangar, I decided to go save him because he had nothing and I could see the other guy had a gun because I'd found some binocs.   Killed the guy with my mossberg picked up his gun and told the guy to come collect the rest of his loot (which included a hammer)   We exchanged our good licks and he went on his merry way."
TheWarZ,"I do not think its aimbot, all aimbots I've seen are very visible and not hidden from screen grabs so they can be seen in videos. Also, players who use them dont tend to line up there shot before popping out like he did.   However, he is clearly hacking. There is a hack called "no spread" a which eliminates all recoil and the accuracy reduction of your weapon when firing. when you fire your gun the crosshairs spread to show that it's becoming less accurate but here as was pointed out in the vid its not happening. Basically, with this hack his gun has 100% accuracy, he still has to aim but he can fire as fast as he wants and it will always hit in the middle of the crosshairs, it is definitely a hack just not aimbot imo."
psbattleroyale,"It's not a matter of dethroning them. It's just that for some of us like Ryko and myself, that amount of money is a lot to throw down to take a gamble on.   So think about it this way: Winter Brawl is going to run you like... $30 by train to get from New York to Philly, both ways in the best case. The Venue fee is $40. The entrance fee is $10. Then you have to consider housing/hotels and what not. That's going to run you about $20~30 to buy into someone's room if you're lucky.   So in the BEST case you're out $110 just to play in the PSABR tournament at Winter Brawl. And the payout will not in any sort of way cover your cost of travel unless you take first with at least like 24 teams playing in it...and the profit line then is very minimal.   It's not like Marvel where winning is a few hundred/thousand dollars and you get all the swag prizing on top of it like a stick/headphones. This is basically a side tournament for a game that isn't going to have a lot of entrants.   You basically are by default a pot monster unless you know for sure a large amount of people are going and you are fairly sure you can beat every last one of them. That's fine. Whatever... just for two working adults, the time and effort isn't compensated enough."
Robocraft,"Legs for sure. I used to play a rail walker in my early days of T10 and even when I got level 100. Keep in mind that this was before the rail buff from DOTM, so I have plenty of railing experience :) Although legs are definitely not the best movement type in the game, they're best for rails because they can get virtually everywhere and stay still when you stop. Wheels and tank treads slide a little now, but they do stay relatively still. However, they are much more prone to tesla attacks which rails have very little defense against. Hovers wobble too much and Fliers are out of the question, so the only other alternative is a sled. I have recently gotten a lot into sleds, and it takes a little getting used to. A proper sled can get anywhere on the map go faster than anything else on your team except UWDd or thruster sticks, and cling to walls. The only problem is that rails are so big that it requires a big bot, and sleds should be nimble and lightweight so they can climb up everything and go fast."
Cartalk,"I'm just gonna throw this non-answer out.  How are you going to deal with the people who get annoyed with you multiple times every day because they have to wait longer for you to restart and accelerate away from traffic lights."
fireemblem,"It is different for genealogy. For one thing, every character has a cannon pair, which generally yields the best or close to the best children. Also, inheritance is wayyy more important in genealogy than awakening. In awakening, pretty much any parent will work for any child, but in genealogy, certain children are almost unusable with the wrong parents. Also, there are certain pairings which are objectively far superior to others, and you would be crazy not to use them. The holy weapons in genealogy are easily 4 or 5 times as strong as any other weapon in any other game, and any character with one is almost instantly god tier. Therefore, it is absurd to pair people in ways that don't pass down holy weapons."
fireemblem,"Aside from me personally disliking that recipe, it factually creates the slowest character in game. Donny who is considered to have one of the worst  final  stats among the 1st gen has 41 max speed as a hero and Morgan in that recipe has  39  max speed in the same class. As a General, Morgan has  32  max speed which is even slower than Frederick or Kellam in the same class. That's very problematic and a major flaw for a character in a game where one considers a unit good when they double hit and the game is balanced assuming that characters double hit in the end levels, or at least that they don't get double hit by most enemies.   It's also worth noting that not being able to double attack equates to all proc skills getting their effectiveness cut by half in essence, which means there's more to the problem than just not attacking one more time. For manaketes with no access to brave weapons, are naturally slow, and have a rather clear limit to the damage they do without proc skills, the above problem also leads to their kill-based(Lifetaker) or damaged-based(Sol) self heals not being effective which in turn hurts their sustainability, especially on enemy turns. Moreover, it also negates the effectiveness of dual attacks, a major firepower booster in FE:A along with proc skills, as well for the same reason.   What also compounds in damaging their sustainability is that enemies with skills will double on them. Double the chance of lethality for example is not fun at all when there's already so many freak incidents of Jaffar killing off units in impossible situations when given even one shot at it. With no finishing power on Morgan(Or Nah)'s side, Sorcerers and Sages with Vengeance are a clear threat because this Morgan's Res is vulnerable. Getting doubled with a moderately procced Vengeance will hurt a LOT and this build assimilates moderately procced Vengeances. Luna is also a threat because of how common they are and that one can consider it to proc at almost 100% chance given the two or four attacks that Morgan and Nah will have to endure.   And then there's the problem of Nah being even more problematic than this Morgan because she inherits the same demerit of having the lowest speed in game while getting fewer class pools with questionable effectiveness and lower defense bonus while having to play the same role as Morgan's.   All in all I think it's only a numerically interesting build at best that only aims for one specific map with debatable actual effectiveness."
fireemblem,"You're forgetting that Dragonstone+ also gives +4 speed, which will mean that her max speed is 36, enough to counter the speed difference for Sorcerers. Not to mention Pair Up! Pairing up Morgan with her husband Berserker will increase her speed to 7, putting her up to 43, enough to eliminate the speed-worry for all the classes, while increasing her damage while at it.   Manakete Morgan shouldn't carry Lifetaker or Sol if you spotpass. She should have Luna, as it increases the damage more than Sol does, she should instead have Renewal.   Morgan will have a Res of  +3 , which combined with the Dragonstone+, will bring her Res up to 52. Enough to block off a large amount of the damage dealt. Vengeance will still be a problem, but if the Sorcerer attacks first or Morgan has Adept, then she'll be able to 3-shot it, or maybe even 2-shot it if Luna pops.   Lethality is a rare beast, only normally found on characters specialized on it, like a Lon'qu!Yarne!Morgan Taguel with Speed MU, but those things will double almost everyone, and a Manakete's range will sometimes be enough to take advantage. The only problem is Luna, but even that is only somewhat problematic. After all, it only has 50% chance of proccing, and even if it does proc, there will still be 5 damage less than what a normal character would take.   At the end of the day, it's all about opinions. This child might fall short for some people, but it might be one of the best for others. Awakening will be faceroll no matter what you do, anyway. When it comes to streetpass, her only stat in the red is actually Speed. Everything else is at 0 or above, so she's good statwise as well.   Nah however, should be discarded the instant Morgan's made. You will never need 2 Manaketes, no matter how different her stats are. She's easily replaced by any other child that isn't gimped."
fireemblem,"Nah however, should be discarded the instant Morgan's made. You will never need 2 Manaketes, no matter how different her stats are. She's easily replaced by any other child that isn't gimped.   Which is why I don't use that build. There's more stable builds that lets you use both Nah and Morgan without such stark problems and Nah happens to be my favorite child along with Morgan so I keep her on my team whatever I'm doing. Also, I think Avatar!Nah&Morgan or just any twin sibling recipe trumps single focused Morgan's usefulness simply because a difference of +3 in defense(That's all this 3rd gen Morgan basically is) is never going to match up to the versatility of having a twin unit with access to all skills in your arsenal.   Also, speed happens to be one of the more important stats with more implications on the game mechanics than most other stats so that being red and at the lowest possible value has more problems than other stats being red imo.   It's one build that has a big number in one stat, but in the end it's just one build among many with comparable effectiveness as you say. It doesn't deserve the misled perception that it's the best for either Nah or Morgan, especially for Nah at the point that Nah is discarded."
fireemblem,"I haven't played many of the Japanese-only games so admittedly maybe my opinion is a bit narrow, but out of the ones I've played so far the Tellius games are probably my favorite.   Basically I would say the best aspects are:     The story (connecting between both games) - which at least out of the ones I've played is the most interesting and well-developed in my opinion     The music - which again is in my opinion some of the best out of all the FE games I've played     The characters - There weren't really any characters that I particularly disliked, and in PoR mainly, many of them were incredibly well developed with their support conversations     Maps/Victory Conditions - Some of my favorite maps come from PoR  and (especially) RD and, other than the desert chapters, Chapter 19 of PoR, and the bridge map they thought would be a good idea to include in both games, there aren't too many that I can think of off the top of my head that I didn't really care for. Also I really enjoyed having a variety of different victory conditions such as defend, escape, arrive, etc. which forced you to strategize a little differently than just run around and kill all the units or the boss     Various other minor things - for instance: the skill system, choosing colored weapons when forging (ok really minor detail), PoR's support system, third tier units in RD (Reaver, Gold/Silver Knight, Trueblade, Sentinel, etc.), and probably quite a few other things I'm currently forgetting"
fireemblem,"Robin is one of three S-ranked units in my completely arbitrary Awakening character tier system.   Classic run wise: GOAT availability. You can design their caps and growths whichever way you want (though I am in agreement that Luck is Fire Emblem's dump stat). Access to any class that isn't unique like Lord/Taguel/Manakete/Villager. Gets two great abilities as a Tier 1 unit, and same upon promotion. Starting off as a Tactician ensures balanced growths.   Min max run: Robin's utility can be split into being a Galeforce master as a female version, or as a father that passes great stats down to potentially two kids."
gorillaz,"Okay, let's look at it logically.   2D: A mentally and physically worn down young man who has had the piss beaten out of him by Murdoc almost constantly. He got kidnapped for the Plastic Beach record and just wants to no longer be part of Gorillaz in general.   Yet people ship him with Murdoc.   Noodle: She's often shipped with 2D. however Noodle and 2D relationship is more of a brother-sister thing, not in anyways a sexual or physical relationship (infact, Noodle and anyone from the band have a brother-sister relationship, although in Russel's case, it's more father-daughter).   Murdoc: a person who encompasses everything wrong in humanity and yet shippers force sexual connotations with him and 2D just "for shipping becuz tehry sooo cute!!!!<3"   I mean, sure, there has been hints that Murdoc and 2D have had sex before, but if those hints are to be believed, that implies Murdoc basically raped 2D.   Russel: I haven't seen Russel being shipped with anyone but Noodle. And the only thing I can say about that is: No, stop, please, no."
chemistry,"This is a great question. When someone asks you "is this molecule stable?" your first response should be "what do you mean by stability?"   Thermodynamic stability refers to a compound's enthalpic energy. This can be thought of as the energy released or added when constructing a compound from its elements, but also takes into account more subtle things, like orbital interactions. If you use computational software, you can get these values, or if you're good with your hands and your math, you can get them from careful calorimetry.   Kinetic stability is a compound's resistance to react. This can be measured by the difference in thermodynamic energies between the compound in question and the lowest transition state leading to a product. Getting a transition state's energy is tough without computational methods, but those are usually close enough to draw conclusions from. The higher the difference between a compound and the transition state, the higher the barrier to reaction is--and therefore, the reaction proceeds at a lower rate.   Usually, when you talk about stability in introductory organic chemistry classes, you're talking about thermodynamic stability (for instance, a chair conformation of cyclohexane has a lower energy than the boat conformation). Under thermodynamic conditions, two compounds in equilibrium will tend to favor the more thermodynamically stable one.   Kinetic stability tells a different story. It deals with the relative rates of reaction (for instance, how fast does a boat conformer switch to a chair conformer?)."
religion,"Did you even bother reading the first paragraph of the article I linked you?  The declaration sets the role, the constitution delivers.   and yes, you did say that they aren't connected.   >  like saying that the declaration and the constitution aren't connected   >They aren't, deal with it.   dude, if you want to see a straw man, look at yourself.  You keep using the words [Organic Law]( like they are helping your argument.  When you can read about organic law and see this right in the first paragraph.   >The Organic Laws of the United States of America can be found in Volume One of the United States Code which contains the General and Permanent Laws of the United States. U.S. Code (2007)[1] defines the organic laws of the United States of America to include the Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776, the Articles of Confederation of November 15, 1777, the Northwest Ordinance of July 13, 1787, and the Constitution of September 17, 1787   and that is just from looking at wikipedia for five seconds.  [Here you can  read  the actual organic laws of the united states of america](   So, again, please don't use words that you don't know what they mean.   >This entire ploy by you has been a strawman because you can't deal with the argument   What argument?  That the declaration of independence isn't a founding document of our system of government or that it isn't a part  of organic law?  Because I'm pretty sure I've linked to several sources showing you that they are connected.  And I know that I've put your organic law argument to rest, seeing how the declaration is right in the organic laws of the USA."

UofT,"TTC in Toronto is pretty functional most of the time albeit nearing capacity in the downtown subway lines. But realize that in comparison to many north american cities its more than decent since a lot of NA cities prioritize cars over public transit.   Europe, Asia, other developing countries, actually do have far more developed transit because of different priorities in infrastructure. A lot of people will come back from another country trying out their transit. If it is better than the TO system will look duller in comparison.   Theres also people who just see the flaws everyday, and are fed up with promises of improvements that never come, so thats why people complain."
UofT,"well... most professional schools do require more than grades.  i've said this so many times but the downtown campus offers a crap load of opportunities right next to where you go to classes, it's just up to students to take advantage of them.   and if a student thinks u of t is hurting his/her chances at professional school, it's a free world - switch to another school.  i hear way too many people bitching and moaning about how much torture u of t is but isn't proactive about making any changes at all.  maybe it's you (using 'you' in a general sense, not aiming at /u/SgtSmackdaddy or anyone else in particular) that's the problem rather than the school?  some people just need to take a deep, hard look at their studying habits and see that whatever worked for them in high school likely isn't what's going to work at u of t.   personally, i can't speak to whether or not u of t is harder than other schools, as i've been here for all of my 7 years of university education... so i think it's unfair for me to comment whether or not ryerson/york/<other school> is supposed to be cruise control vs u of t.  but i can say in most cases that each grade i've got is the grade i've earned (and i deserved many of my low 60s in my first 2 years of undergrad, as much as i hate to admit it), instead of "X prof/TA/program is so fucking hard and unfair!!!""

sanfrancisco,"You have a few options to deal with that, one being fairly cheap but politically difficult and the other being expensive with varying degrees of political difficulty:     Wider stop spacing. This can help reduce overall trip time by reducing load and dwell times. This is relatively cheap but keep in mind that each stop will have a very vocal constituency that will undoubtedly turn each proposed stop removal into a battle citing an agenda against the poor, elderly, etc.     Signalize intersections. I seem to remember the cost of this being well into the six figure range per intersection. This could improve service if transit signal priority was implemented (at additional cost). This may be more politically palatable, though there will undoubtedly be battles about the traffic signal cabinet placements, but the cost of signalizing a corridor like Noriega is something that have to be seriously prioritized because of the cost.       Suffice it to say that the best bang for your buck option is killed at the community level and the "throw money at the problem" solution is off the table because it's lack of value (a slight increase in reliability for a $20+ million dollar project)."
sanfrancisco,"You couldn't be more wrong about your #3. It's not the land lords fault at all. It's all these people who desperately want to live here throwing their cash around bidding on places that drive the rent higher. Once one person starts paying more than the average price in an area, all the other places around it go up because now there are people willing to shell out the cash. It is at no fault to the land lord for doing what they sought out to do in the first place which is make a profit.   Our middle class has seen a decline ever since Ed Lee started gentrifying more lower income/middle income areas and attracting people willing to pay ridiculous ass prices for rent.   If you think redevelopment is going to bring rent prices down, you are incorrect. I have not seen that ONCE in any of the areas being redone. Turning single family homes into mid rise apartments would only mean more people paying a ridiculous rent rate because that much more space is available now. The idea that if SF built more rooms that there would be more space than there are people wanting to live within the city makes no sense. A bunch of people already live outside of San Francisco because they can't afford to live in. Do you really think those people would stay out if they had a chance to move in? I think not. I think the opposite happens and rent prices continue to go up.   I've lived in Ingleside my whole life. It wasn't the best area to grow up for a nice part of my life. Ed Lee has wanted to build up the area since he got into office. While initially it seemed pretty cool, the result has been terrible. Ocean used to be nothing but mom and pop type places. Though a nice amount still exist (mostly coffee shops) a nice amount are being phased out. Lee wants big names in the area and started with Whole Foods on the bottom of the Avalon Apartments. The apartments sit right on Ocean across from the McDonalds. I live literally 4 blocks up the hill. Rent there starts at $2280 for a studio. Are you fucking kidding me? That's double the amount of my house. Now that people are openly willing to live there, the rest of the area is starting to face an increase in rent. You have people moving in following the boom and a number of college students (multiple ones) moving into homes here while they attend school that is jacking up the prices like crazy. And it all started because of ONE apartment complex on Ocean.   Some people will disagree because that side of Ocean behind the Walgreens/24 has been nicer and paid more rent, but that's never effected the other side of the hill off of Ocean like it does now. If not for the rent protection, I'm pretty sure non of my neighbors would be here still. I see college students rent out the house across the street every year paying ridiculous rent with like 6 people in the place to try and balance it out. Had the area not started this redevelopment process that is always apartments + commercial business, it would not be the case.   Hell, it's not even safer. Cars still get broken into on the regular, people still get harassed  walking the streets at night. There are less gun shots, but the rent still isn't justified."

hordeguild,"Granted, you've played with me so you already know if you want me or not for this one; regardless, here's my life history for review anyway:   -Balance Druid, will someday hit #1 spot on dps, even if I have to form my own guild to do so.  Everything went according to plan with achievement points.  I'm willing to swap to resto if needed, which would be an easy move since all my gear overlaps except for trinkets.   - ninja edit: 367 average, but I'm logged in on my pvp gear so it says 365 equipped.  wtf.  Dammit Niwa.   -I've been in every raid except Ruby Sanctum and the first Naxx (not necessarily completed them, oh well).  I'm talking about running them during max level during their times, and not 85 run-throughs.  I learn mechanics quickly, which I consider my strength.  My goal for wipes is to be the last person alive haha.  Let's see, oh yeah, I've played resto for all Wrath content, so I'm not too rusty doing that, otherwise I've been dps.  I'm not too fond of the idea of tanking as a bear, since pally tanking = the bomb.   Other notes:  I won't get butthurt if I'm not accepted into this first raid, as long as it's for a good reason haha.  If I suck, tell me, and I'll improve.  If that fails, I'll gladly bow out.  Most importantly, I bring an easy-going attitude - the game is about fun.  I do not do good in "hardcore" raiding due to the angry nerd rage over vent; I'd rather be in the fail-raid that's having fun (although I would like to see some progression haha).  If I can't play Pink Fluffy Unicorn videos over mumble, then there's a problem lol."
entwives,"Hey so... I just did a little research on this.  I'm very interested, because I'm going to be a family medicine doctor in May and I want to know the answer to this question (also because I have a vagina and I smoke weed).   Essentially, when these ladies say that there is no research on this, they are right.  It sucks, but it's impossible to say for SURE whether smoking weed will increase your clot risk.   On the other hand (here's the part where I give unlicensed advice against my better judgment), I think it's probably a lot less risky than cigarettes because of:   Nicotine-- constricts blood vessels, which can increase clot risk and stroke risk (both because of its blood pressure effects, and independently).  This is probably the main mechanism of cigarettes causing increased clots in women on OCPs.   I do think that there is still an effect of inhaling combustion products-- there will always be toxins in smoke, which is bad for your lungs, which can in turn be bad for your heart, and your blood vessels, and your clot risk.... so vaporizing is indeed better for you (I just invested in a "fragrance machine" for Christmas).   Also, Nuvaring does give you fewer systemic hormones than oral contraceptives (more of it stays locally) but you still have higher clot risk with it than without it."

TheLastAirbender,"I'm Fairly neutral on LoK. I didn't like it as much as TLA but that is more or less to be expected right? The sequel is never as good as the first. I feel Like LoK gets a lot of flak because of the pacing. They tried to fit way too much into 13 episodes. It's not something people would necessarily recognize right away as a source of a problem. If the season had been 20-23 episodes long a lot of people's complaints would probably disappear, because the crew would have had longer to develop the characters, to work on plot points, etc. There is the pacing issue but there's also Korra herself. Korra is great, she's a great character and has a lot of great qualities, but, at the end of the day, She isn't Aang. A major thing I hear is "ugh, how could such a violent and unrefinded girl have been the avatar after Aang. She's so different." Well yeah, compare Aang to Roku, Kuruk or Kiyoshi. Aang was an exception to the rule. If anything, Korra is more like her predecessors than Aang was, and people weren't expecting it."
TheLastAirbender,"I don't think that a lot of classes would be the best way to handle things.  It should be more about what items you get in the game and how you use them.  For example, a bender from the air nomad race would start out with their bare hands and some basic airbending moves.  As they progress, they would find scrolls and level up to learn new airbending moves.  This would make their character unique.  They could also find different types of airbending staffs to be able to travel faster and get up to high places.   The main thing about MMORPGs in my opinion is the ability to explore the open world and customize your character.  Learning new bending moves would definitely help to customize your character.  If you were a warrior who is a non-bender, you could still have different types of attacks and weapons to make yourself unique.   Anyway, my input."
TheLastAirbender,"That's definitely a strong possibility, as I don't think she thought of URN as a superpower, considering how rashly she approached attacking it.   On a similar note, I actually think the Fire Nation military is still as strong, relatively, in the present as it was during the 100 year war. A lot of people on this sub seem to think that the FN went pacifist post war like Japan, but they tend to forget that really the only reason for Japanese pacification was that they were forced to do it. While the FN technically "lost" the war, they did so without losing any home industrial capacity and kept a very large part of their military strength, something that Japan and Germany couldn't say post WW2. In addition, the early troubles with the Harmony Restoration movement and just his personality in general, tells me that Zuko wasn't so quick to demilitarize after the war.   I just realized I kinda trailed off haha, but"
TheLastAirbender,"Yeah. Japan could've probably taken Vladivostok without much trouble, but there's no way they could've feasibly crossed Siberia to help the Germany take Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Moscow. Additionally, even if Germany had managed to take Moscow (through the added force they would have by only needing to fight on a single front), Soviet forces most likely would have retreated further east (similarly to how Mao retreated inland during the great march) whilst arming guerrilla forces around Moscow to harrass the German occupation."
TheLastAirbender,"Yeah I think tenzin can be a bit underestimated by viewers because he's made out to be such a pansy with his overprotective nature.

ModernMagic,"I'm really glad you put the donations poll up. I think it can certainly ruin the legitimacy of the project, but at the same time it seems hard to turn it down... My greatest concern if you allow it and other donations is that eventually it  could  catch on enough that people will gather together and donate all the cards you could need for the deck. However, I think a compromise could be reached. Perhaps instead of just accepting it, you could still use your budget but get a discount price on it. So instead of spending $18 of your budget on Thoughtseize, you could take out just $9 instead. This keeps some legitimacy to the project, while also kind of factoring in for things like friends giving you a good trade deal to help you start out or similar things of that nature.   Also, I'm wondering about the replacing of Elspeth from the deck... Can't we factor that into our cost as well? If you take out an expensive card, can we assume you could trade that for value or trade it into the store and get some additional money back for our budget? IRL if you were to buy this deck and swap out the Elspeth, it's not like the card just vanishes, but instead likely goes into a trade binder or something similar which can be used toward acquiring Thoughtseize."
ModernMagic,"Monastery Mentor is bad in Delver, and I'll tell you why.   Delver decks want to run a low land count, 18-20, since they also want to be full of cheap cantrips.   Everyone and their brother played against Delver in the past three months.  Everyone knows how the deck works.  That means that everyone knows that as soon as you see a Young Pyromancer, you kill it.  Like Young Pyromancer, Monastery Mentor dies to all the common Modern removal--Path to Exile, Abrupt Decay, and Lightning Bolt.  Delver players know that that Pyro and Mentor are both very vulnerable to removal, so the smart play is usually to slow-roll a Pyromancer until you have 3 mana, guaranteeing that you can at the very least play something in response to their immediate kill spell and get value.  So, that means waiting until you have 3 land, in a deck that's only running 18-20.   That's totally doable.  But let's look at Mentor.  Now you're running a 3 color deck, instead of a 2 color deck.  You don't want to add more land, because your namesake card is still dependent on there being lots of Instants and Sorceries in your deck so that he turns into the fly from hell.  So your mana, and your deck in general, becomes less consistent purely by putting Monastery Mentor in your deck.  Low consistency is always bad, but it's doubly bad in a tempo deck that's relying on slipping through cantrips.   On top of that, if you want to make sure that you actually get some value out of your Mentor, you have to wait until turn 4, minimum.  Since  you only have 18-20 lands, it's probably closer to turn 6.  A tempo deck doesn't want to be making tokens on turn 6.  It wants to be firing it's last bolt into the opponent's face for lethal."

This is a misconception as an atheist, from his/her lack of afterlife, values the current life and thus will avoid any damage to their life. Turning it around, a theist who believes in afterlife will fear no consequences in afterlife as long as they believe they are doing the right thing, no matter of what their perception is right or not.

The counterargument is structurally valid, so the only thing left to talk about is the truth value of the premises.  Premise 1 is unmodified and thus uncontroversial.  Therefore, the source of your objection must be premise 2; but, if god is neither abstract nor physical, then we both acknowledge that there is at least one additional category in which to place things.  If that is correct, then you cannot claim that the laws of logic are abstract simply by observing that they are not physical, since they might fall into the third category (or even some other)."
DebateAnAtheist,"Can a logically consistent atheist believe that life on other planets exists?   Let's ignore for the moment the fact that you're going to get a bunch of statements to the effect that "atheizm is just a lack of believes in gods!!1!" There's nothing inconsistent about recognizing that the conditions for the formation of life on our planet are probably not unique to this planet, and indeed all indications are that they are ubiquitous. If anything, it would be foolish to suggest that life on other planets was  impossible . While it may be improper to form a belief that there  is  life on other planets, there is nothing at all wrong with believing that life on other planets is  likely .   Your question conflates the probability that there is life elsewhere in the universe with the probability that there is a single eternally existent entity with magical powers. I have no positive evidence that there is a fire burning anywhere within ten blocks of my house, but to form a belief to that effect is hardly a great offense -- it's nothing like forming a belief that there might be gods.   Indeed, if the atheist notes that she  shouldn't  form a belief that gods exist specifically because there is no evidence, she might yet be vindicated with respect to forming beliefs that life exists on other planets -- there  is  evidence that life exists elsewhere. Well, specifically, there is evidence that the  conditions  for life are elsewhere met.   You see, life is  contingent . There are conditions which must be met if life is even to have a  possibility  of existing. Like the fire I may or may not believe is presently burning within a ten-block radius of my house, the  conditions  for life are surely somewhere met -- the question becomes one of whether or not there has been a spark. Since gods are [presumably]  necessary  (if they exist at all), there cannot be any special conditions which might count as [inductive] evidence -- so these two (gods and alien life) are not commensurate."
DebateAnAtheist,"There is a certain likelihood that aliens may exist. However, this likelihood is based on a few assumptions about things we don't know enough about  yet . Such as:     How common are planets? (we're making a lot of progress on this one)   How common are planets capable of supporting life? (also making a little progress on this one)   How likely is it that life will form in such an environment (we really can't know this one, until we actually visit other planets and check)     So as a logically consistent atheist, I'd believe alien life is possible, but we don't even know yet how likely it is. If I had to guess, I'd say about a 10% chance of life existing elsewhere in the universe.   Remember that one galaxy alone has about 300 billion stars, and there are many galaxies. We currently know of 849 extra-solar planets just in our neighbourhood.   That is a different argument, though, to my atheism . I believe there cannot be a god because the concept is logically inconsistent. Aliens  might  exist logically. We know life forms can exist because we  are  life forms. The same argument couldn't be used for gods, because we've never discovered any of them."

Frat,"Chapters with a commitment to productive, meaningful pledging have most, if not all, of these things in place. University offices that deal with Greek life know they exist, but typically turn a bling eye unless the chapter is found in violation of something that could be bad PR. If they wanted to, most universities could call for an end to Greek life and would have the support of a majority of the faculty and student body. However, these schools won't shut down Greek life for various reasons. Instead, chapters only go down if their "hazing" is exposed to the public, in which case they use literally every violation as evidence against the chapter, perpetuating this whole "greek life is terrible" BS simply because its easier to have a group of 20-somethings take the fall, instead of the university properly addressing larger problems with the campus (but I digress)."

Buying this game from Amazon can return to you as a benefit like a $5 coupon when the Summer Sale hits."
GameDeals,"I found Guerrilla to be pretty much Just Cause 2 done right. Both games are very much about creating as much chaos as possible, but whereas Just Cause 2 fell very flat on its face in providing raw fun, Guerrilla manages to do it right. Not only are the game's environment destruction mechanics innately enjoyable by themselves, the game takes it a step further and constantly gives new bigger and better toys to play with, ensuring that you never get bored from doing the same activity repeatedly. Whether you're toppling 5 story buildings with your trusty sledgehammer or slapping structures around with a construction robot, Guerrilla manages to provide a sense of satisfaction that is not present in many games."

GameDeals,"I've had this on my wishlist for a bit - is this worth $18? I have reasonable, but not overly abundant, tolerance for games still in development if they're compelling enough as is. How does it compare in terms of playability/fun to something like a Kerbal Space Program  - which I find to be remarkably solid for an Alpha? (understanding that they're completely different games)."
GameDeals,"Ultimate edition was blocked on my country, too. So I found a brazilian and bought from him. (in brazil games are cheaper) it wasn't a %75 off deal, so i gave more than this price, it was around $12 and it's one of the most expensive games i've ever bought. But worth it.   Now, my humble opinions about the game.   *story: definitely one of the best game stories. It's not the best but hey, a branching, decent story. It's impossible to find that this days. Also i sensed some Wheel of Time. (blight, darkspawn, aes sedai (reverend mother) and lots more.. )   *graphics: not the best side of the game, but it's good in general. But, character models are more than well-made. There are some good scenery, too.     gameplay: if you play it as an arpg, you'll suffer in pain. I might say it's a tactical rpg. You can pause the battle, give commands, and then continue the fight by commanding all characters from top, or select one and play as him/her. I loved it.     The only bad thing about the game is, it doesn't let me get involved in romance with both morrigan and leliana. I love both of them, but they  don't like each other :("
GameDeals,"The only one I can talk about is Breach and Clear. Picked it up in a bundle a while back, it's sort of like X-Com lite.   Not much of a tech tree, but you can customize weapons each team member has, equipment like armour and grenades, and each guy has a class with certain abilities.   Plays like X-Com,the pseudo real-time thing where you give orders to your team and hit the Go button to watch it all play out. Take advantage of cover and line of sight to take out your enemies.   I played it on Android, and it's a little hard to get used to control wise in my opinion. Nothing game breaking, but it's a little hair pulling to think a gesture does one thing but it does another. I think it was easier to play on my Nexus 10 than my HTC One (M7)."
GameDeals,"Honestly, I'd just go with the era you like the look of the most.   If you want Medieval then go for Medieval 2. It's probably my favourite game in the series and it's got a pretty active and fantastic modding community. As with the original Rome you'd think they're pretty dated but they're still both very playable and you'd hardly notice their age when you get into it. However neither of these seem to be in the sale.   Shogun 2 is arguably the most solid in the series and has a very good multiplayer community. There isn't much in terms of unit variety though and the campaign map is pretty small. Definitely the best if you want to zoom in on the battlefield, you see lots of action going on between the units. It's a pretty good game to enter the series in personally.   If you want an early modern period then your best bet is either Empire, Napoleon or Fall of the Samurai. Empire is pretty buggy and glitchy but has the largest campaign map of all of the Total War games. Napoleon is a smaller scale version of Empire but is a much more refined and solid game than Empire. Fall of the Samurai is the only in the series I haven't played, if somebody could shed some light on this one, please tell me.   Rome 2 and Attila are the newest in the series. Rome 2 had a rocky release but is a very solid game. They play a little bit differently to the earlier games in the series but are still incredibly fun to play, I would say Attila is the most difficult in the series and definitely keeps you on edge through the whole campaign."
shutupandtakemymoney,"This is a current issue that may see no end (also closures such as corks/fake corks/[zorks](   First some background:   "High end" wine, which is defined by anything over $25 strangely enough, will almost never be in a box. The biggest reasoning is that some gas exchange is good. A well made bottle of wine (of the right varietals) needs a good cork to cellar and age. When stored properly the cork will allow a very minute amount of gases to go back and forth. This aids in the chemical changes that take place in a good bottle over time. When an artificial closure or a bag is used, it is too air tight for long term storage and maturation. All the hard work that went into making a wine of high enough quality to age will be lost. As for mid-tier wines, the story is different. These wines can have some age, maybe up to 5 years, but isn't required. A lot of wine these days is being made to be drunk immediately, and not age, which makes it perfectly suitable for other packing and closures.   So about the boxes:   If there is such a large percentage of wine that falls into the mid-tier category, that doesn't require aging, then why isn't it in boxes? Some are.  Clif  can be found in a box, and are quite good for the price. There are also some eco-minded small producers (both old and new world) that use [tetra packs]( For the most part, most still aren't because of the stigma surrounding it. People see a box, they think of Fred Franzia's swill in-o-box, and turn their nose up to it. Wine is  incredibly  psychological to sell, and a bad package can turn people off to it regardless of the quality of what's in it."
shutupandtakemymoney,"Regardless of if it's a wine I represent or not, I will still point someone to good wine. I don't get people who don't do that. It would help break the pretentious stigma.   Anyway: this could take a bit of explaining. A lot of wine is aged in barrels (others in stainless steel or cement tanks). Quality wines always are if they desire that kind of treatment (some types of wine taste better unoaked [barrels are various types of oak]). One a side note, cheaper wines typically don't use barrels, but instead use staves, chips, or even essence to add the flavor and effect. Good wine that is meant to be aged, needs proper conditions and a real cork for proper gas exchange through the bottle.   I'm giving you this background so you can fully understand why you both can and can't. Yes you can, because a lot of wine is already. At the same time you can't (or won't), because if you are investing the money into aging a wine in a nice french oak barrel, you're not going to want to package it in something that won't let it age more. The barrel will add and change the wine, and then the process will continue in a neutral glass bottle (but without the oak adding to it). As the wine ages, it chemically changes, and proper barrel aging is one of the many parts that lets you do that. If you took that wine, put it in a bag (bladder), and then drank it down the road, it would be rough, tannic, and for lack of a better word, tight."

gamegrumps,"His reference back to Sonic 06 made me start wondering again whether or not Sonic Boom is a worse game. So rather than just agreeing with each other about how bad Boom is, how about we have a discussion about which is the shittier?   Personally, I think Boom is the worse title. 06 is still enjoyable in a surreal way, mostly because you can see some fun mechanics and parts through the obfuscation of glitches and bugs. Plus, the glitches happen naturally rather than having to be sought out. This combination of weird shit happening at random and that you can easily see how a finished version of 06 would be fun make 06 what it is.   Boom, while not as broken or unfinished (though certainly unfinished to some degree), usual requires players to seek out its glitches rather than have them naturally happen. On top of that, the game just has worse design choices. The game puts rings everywhere, and often has rings as a reward for completing extra challenges...but rings are littered everywhere and the fights are never challenging enough that you're below 100 rings. Combat is boring, as you can't string combos and none of the attacks feel remotely good or have any impact, platforming is a tedious quest for green buttons, running sections get fucked up by the bad framerate, and the plot is awful."

gamegrumps,"I haven't seen the episodes with holly, but from her content I've seen she's a great person. Unfortunately people shit on the women in let's plays because they're new and they're girls. If you look at roosterteeth, everybody was bitching about the new people, but more so Lindsay calling her fat ugly and not funny, which isn't true and very uncalled for and completely unrelated. Many guys, and some women don't think women should be or can be funny. Not to mention 80% of the time they go into it expecting to hate the new person, so they convince themselves they do. They hold new things and people to a standard, and the grump women more so seeing as they are married to the grumps and some people dislike them because they're being "forced on us"."
gamegrumps,"This is hands down the thing that makes me the angriest. I personally don't like Suzy (although she has gotten better) because she cried sexism when people didnt like her on game grumps. I had no problem with her before that, but c'mon act like an adult and take criticism. People loved holly, just because someone doesn't like you doesn't mean it's because you're a girl. Game Grumps has always been about personality and comedy, and Suzy I guess just has a different approach than the other grumps."
doctorwho,"Thinking about it, when Rose left and the Doctor met Donna for the first time, he saw two people dancing and they reminded him of him and Rose. Most people can relate to seeing strangers and being reminded of a lost love. When he meets Martha, he meets a woman who is so much like Rose. A strong, beautiful woman capable of keeping up with him. She can do almost anything Rose could. She can keep up with the doctor, help in her own special, human way, and keep the Doctor in check. It hurts being reminded of lost love when you see strangers, but knowing someone who is so much like Rose is even worst. He tries to fool himself, when Martha tries to help, and the Doctor knows she can, he tries to pretend that Martha isn't as good as Rose because he doesn't want her to be. He says, "Rose would know what to do," because he knows Rose would and he doesn't want to believe that Martha is just as capable as Rose. I feel that if the roles were switched, he would be in love with Martha and when he met Rose, he would act like she isn't as good. When Martha leaves, she tells him that she can't waste her life on someone who won't be with her. This makes the Doctor realize that, because Rose is gone, he needs to get over her, or at least stop dwelling on her parting because he knows she can't come back. He'll stop comparing others to Rose. When he meets Donna a second time, he's done dwelling on Rose, and Donna notices that he's better. He thinks to himself "I have met you twice, in all of space and time (21st Century London) I have met you twice." Donna has proven herself a capable companion and the Doctor doesn't believe in coincidences. I feel that's why he was rude to Martha, but seemed to instantly get over everything and be happy with Donna."
doctorwho,"I do hate to be a naysayer here, but seeing as what you're looking to use it for it's going to be quite difficult to find someone completely willing to do that for free.  It's custom artwork. Used for a tattoo. Doesn't matter if it's just a few lines in a general box shape or not. Tattoos are personal.   Tattoo art is very customized to you, and odds are it's going to require revision to make it exactly what you want. And then it's going to go to the tattoo artist who is going to say the same thing and revise a little more so it works on your skin. I would advise talking to a tattoo artist. They may not be Whovian, but if you show them a picture of the TARDIS and a general idea, they can probably get you what you want. They're artists after all, it's in the name. It's what they do. And as you know, tattoos (good ones) aren't cheap. They're well worth it in quality, despite me having none, you can tell when something's been done meticulously. A tattoo artist uses skin and ink as their mediums of choice, whereas most artists you will find on reddit will be exclusively sticking with paper or a computer screen-an entirely different beast.   Had you left out the tattoo bit, I'm sure you would have had some more people pouncing on it to draw it. I certainly would have. But any time I've drawn flash art, it's not cheap for me (I'm not a digital artist), and even then it's probably got to be retooled by the tattoo artist because of sizing issues with what part of your body you want it on, and your own skin and what they feel will look best as it ages and heals. Especially with you wanting something minimalistic, not that line art tattoos aren't popular by any means, but nuances that happen with hand drawn, or even digital art, aren't going to be entirely possible with a tattoo and you'll still need to talk with them anyway to get it just right for you.   I didn't mean to turn this into a long post-just kind of happened. I'm sorry!"
doctorwho,"I liked her. I never really hate a companion unless they hate The Doctor, complain, or yell too much. Since Rose, I got used to "Oh Doctor, you're such a hottie. Can I kiss you? I want your body."   Though, Martha was a pretty strongwilled woman without The Doctor. She was not willing to leave her family for The Doctor (because he really ignored her) and it wasn't fair. I hope to see her again for the 50th. I want to explore her story a bit more."
doctorwho,"Word of warning a couple are a little bit hit and miss but keep watching.   With Ecclestone it takes about 6 episodes until he clicks, for the first half it's mainly about introducing the audience to the idea of Doctor Who and time and space travel. Episode 6, Dalek, introduces The Doctors greatest enemy back into the show (Daleks are now a bit of a laughing stock, but that episode made me scared of them). It's also the episode where Christopher gets really into the role.   With Tennant, his first episode didn't have much of him except for the last ten minutes where he just instantly clicks into place as The Doctor. Tenants first series does have one of the worst episodes of the show ever made though, Fear Her, which was literally written at the last minute because of budget problems with the episode originally planned to be in its place. The rest of his series though is fantastic, including the series 3 episode Blink which was thought by many to be the best episode of New Who ever written (Written by the great Steven Moffat no less).   Then you get Matt Smith, when he came on the showrunner, Russell T Davies had left, and Steven Moffat had taken his place, the shows budget got better, it was made in HD, good CGI and absolutely stellar acting. Even if an episode with Smith isn't that good you'll enjoy it simply because he offer the best portrayal of The Doctor I have ever experienced, especially in the newest episode Nightmare In Silver, where he plays two versions of The Doctor. Like Tennant, Smith really came into the role in his first episode, Eleventh Hour, which ended with me completely forgetting how great David was."
doctorwho,"I actually like her as an actress, I just think that she was given sort of the worst plot line and writing for most of her time on the show. I haven't rewatched her season recently so I'm probably leaving out stuff and I may be wrong on some of the details.   For example, I loved her in Smith and Jones, the Family of Blood episodes, the season 3 finale (although I have problems with that finale itself but not her performance) and in her appearances after season 3. In those episodes she was allowed to be her own person, and she had a really strong, cool personality. In a lot of the other episodes in season 3, her defining characteristic was that she was quietly pining over the doctor. For me, that's just not interesting to watch and, frankly, having unrequited love as the defining aspect is going to make almost any character look at least a little pathetic.   I loved her first episode because she was smart and capable. I really liked her in Family of Blood because she was on her own for a lot of it and I feel like we got to see more of her character and how resourceful she could be. Most of all,  I loved her exit because  I also really liked the moments in her season when she would call the doctor out on stuff.   In her appearances after season 3 (when she's gotten over her crush) I think she's a pretty cool character because she took her time with the doctor to make a new life for herself and do her part to protect the world."
doctorwho,"I loved Clara from the beginning and still do, but they fucked up her entire arc. I mean, we started the season knowing she was the Impossible Girl, and they didn't do anything to advance that, merely kept reminding us over and over that she was impossible.   The most excited I was during this last season was during the commercial break after the second Clara appeared at the haunted house. I was thrilled to finally be seeing yet another Impossible Girl.  And the biggest disappointment of the season was about 3 seconds back from the break when she revealed herself to be the Tardis."
doctorwho,"Only been a fan for about a year. My sister was going through an "All things British" phase and she watched Doctor Who and forced me to watch it with her. She's moved on and I have been hooked ever since. I've watched the reboot through twice now, and have watched the first four seasons (the classic episodes). Doctor Who just has elements of everything that I like: history, time travel, space travel, moral conflict, and, usually, great storytelling.   I can't wait for Capaldi's hopefully more sinister take on the Doctor, which would be an interesting departure from the mostly fun-loving Tennant and Smith doctors."

exmormon,"names have been changed to protect the innocent)   I've shared this before, so apologies if some have read it. Mom committed suicide in August 2003. In the days/ weeks/ months that followed, this happened:   As a temple recommend holder, I was asked to help dress her body in her temple clothes for the funeral. I tried to refuse and was guilt-tripped into it. I pretty much stopped trying to be temple worthy after that, because I never wanted to have to dress another deceased loved one for their grave.   My dad met a woman 3 or 4 months after mom died (in Nov/Dec 2003) through an lds dating site. They were engaged soon after, and married by May 1, 2004. I call her Connie 2 because she has the same name as my mom. During their dating/ engagement/ newlywed phase, dad and Connie often spoke of my mom. Apparently mom had a habit of dropping by to reassure Dad, Connie, my active siblings, and various ward members that she'd been close to that she was happy/ content in heaven, and that she was preparing mansions for them. Also she told dad and Connie that she blessed their marriage.   Meanwhile , I, her daughter who had always struggled with religious doubts, was struggling with nightmares where my zombie mom reached to me with gravedirt fingers and begged me to explain why I'd let everyone forget her, why we had abandoned her in the cold earth, why a new Connie had moved into her house and bed.   For me, it came down to two questions:  One  Why would mom comfort those who had testimonies, but not the doubting daughter who she loved just as much?  Answer : God must be preventing her. That makes no sense. Why would God prevent that? If God was so cruel as to prevent that, why would mom put up with it? Mom always put her family first and loved all her children equally -- mom would burn down heaven itself if she had to in order to get to me and comfort me in my grief, and I know that in a way I have never known God.   Which led to  question two : Whose love do I trust more, God's or moms?  Answer  Well, I have a lifetime of evidence for my mom's love, and for God's love . . . just the assurance that he gives us nothing we cannot handle. Logically, that means moms suicide was in God's plan, because he had to know she could not in fact handle the depression. Suicide is like the antithesis of "handling" it. Unless God's mysterious plan means "handling it" is actually just removing herself from the situation . . . regardless, one way or another, God was either cool with mom's death, or mom was being punished for time and all eternity for a moment's weakness, and neither of those possibilities jived with the loving God I'd been taught about.   There was also Connie 2 herself. She has serious issues with the whole heavenly polygamy thing.  Serious  issues. She's actually a pretty cool lady -- nothing like my mom, but cool in her own right. Unfortunately, she's  completely  thrown for a loop by my deceased mom who she never met.   See, apparently dad's patriarchal blessing said something about knowing his eternal wife in the pre-existence and that he knew her name. Dad's always told that story in relation to Connie 1, my mom. But then he meets Connie 2, who has the same name and is also (now) an eternal wife. Suddenly what was once a sweet/ romantic story turns into a test for Connie 2 -- was she or my mom the intended wife from the pre-existence?   Connie 2 often ruminates on these things. She ricochets from faux respect for my mom to hoping my dad is righteous enough for two mansions so she doesn't have to share a household with a sister wife. She has actually told me that if my dad gets two mansions, then one will be like a place of learning/ university/ book club (that would be my college graduate mother) while the other would be like the playboy mansion (that would be Connie 2's perception of her worth).   I'd always had doubts before 2003. I'd always been the black sheep of the family, always asking uncomfortable questions and doing things that seemed rational to me, but irrational to my family. When I was a teenager, my mom once caught me smoking pot. She went into this whole ranty guilt-trip thing with "where did I go wrong," and "what did I do wrong," regarding her parenting. I told her she'd done everything right, and I just couldn't help my personality -- I had to  know , not just accept someone else's word/ experience.   She kept bewailing the situation, and I grabbed her arm and said (paraphrasing, but this is the gist of it), "Mom. We were given free will. God doesn't want us to blindly obey orders; he wants us to build faith. I can't do that without experience -- how is it building faith if I'm just shutting my eyes and ears to the world around me and following the rules exactly? That's just leaning on your testimony, and you always tell me not to do that. I'm making my mistakes my way, and you just have to trust that God has a plan for me."   That was the kind of convoluted logic that always had my parents shutting up and sitting back, kind of shaking their heads and letting my blaze my own path, even if it lead away from the church. But I always meandered my way back.   In the back of my mind, I always figured once I got married, had babies, was sealed in the temple -- once I did everything right, it would all just fall into place and stop being so damned hard.   Instead, it got harder, and I hated being a mom and the temple ceremony was creepy and my doubts just got stronger and stronger. I kept praying and studying the scriptures and trying  so. damn. hard . I kept trying to make it all fit. And then mom killed herself, and it was just like the need to try just disappeared.   Then, on top of that, the wtf'ery of Connie 2's issues and jealousies -- especially when juxtaposed against her actually very nice, if a little too over-sharey personality -- it just highlighted the church crazy and how it can fuck with otherwise decent people's heads.   Connie 2 has no reason to be jealous of my mom, or to try and devalue my mom's marriage to my dad (she's said at various times that dad stayed with my bipolar (in treatment) mom out of "duty", that dad didn't really have a sex life with my mom, that dad was "so relieved" that Connie 2 loves sex in a way Connie 1 never did (I know, the woman needs boundaries. Believe me,  I KNOW . She has told me stories that scarred my poor brain. I kept yelling,  "I'm his daughter , don't  tell  me that," but she kept talking.).   She's told me ward members said my mom was "kind of a bitch" (the alleged ward member moved in after my mom fell into her final depression, and never actually knew my mom in health and joy), she tried to throw away my mom's wedding china, she did throw away my mom's funeral flower petals and wedding ring, and she refuses to use my mom's sewing machine or KitchenAid because "they're haunted."   Yet despite all this insanity and insecurity, Connie 2 is a great woman. She's loves my dad completely and makes him happy, she's completely different in personality from my mom; more outspoken and adventurous. She's got a bit of a sailor mouth on her and is more relaxed about mormon conventions -- like, she says prayer by holding hands around the table instead of folding arms and bowing head. She's completely and 100% accepted the grandkids as "hers", and she's a fantastic grandmother. She has them come visit, makes great hand-made birthday and Christmas gifts, and has somehow managed to never once let her insecurities and jealousies regarding my mother slip to the kids. She's actually a really good person, it's just that since she can't actually be our stepmom (we were all grown and out of the house when mom died), she tries to be our friend . . . and with her personality, that results in some boundaries being crossed and conversations happening that just shouldn't. They just shouldn't.   Sorry, I got off tangent. Anyway, the point is"
exmormon,"Basically cut corners when ever possible. Say a Scout Leader is doing some kind of mutual activity for the deacons/teachers. He's got 5 guys there doing the mutual activity. There is probably only 1 or 2 guys into it. They all do varying levels of said prerequisites for the actual merit badge. Maybe one go getter has actually done everything there is but most have half ass-ed the whole thing and are going to forget everything the next day just like school. The hour and a half are done and everyone gets signed off regardless of their level of participation. Then you have the BSA savvy ladies who can basically just call people drive over papers and you get your award to be handed out at the next court of honor. There were so many court of honors for eagle scouts at my ward that we were doubling and even tripling up for the awards. Pretty sure mine was with 2 other guys. Its frustrating for guys like me who go on 50 mile hikes and do more proactive things beyond simple church activities to get the special award. It doesn't feel very special or important when you and 3 other guys got it and you know at least one of them half assed it. I'm just a little bit bitter. If I want that on my resume, how do I know the boss looking it over is a sensible person aware of this fiasco or just another mormon who would appreciate it or anywhere in between."
exmormon,"Well, there are four (two for the Aaronic Priesthood and two for the Melchizedek Priesthood). The first one is mostly a normal handshake with the thumb over the knuckle of the pointer finger. It's name is whatever your name is (or the name of the dead person if you're not there for the first time).The second "token" is similar, with the thumb in between the pointer and middle fingers. Its name is the "new name" you get in the temple (supposedly your super secret name from the preexistence, but really just whatever name happened to be on the list that day; its the same name for everyone there).   The third one has you hand fully extended and perpendicular to the floor. The temple worker comes and puts his or her thumb and index finger on the middle of each side of your hand. It is called the sign of the nail, and its name is the Son. The final handshake is Patriarchal Grip, or Sure Sign of the Nail. It has interlocking pinkie fingers, with the pointer finger extended to the wrist. Its name is ridiculously long and bizarre. If I remember correctly it is "Health in the navel, marrow in the bones, strength in the loins and in the sinews, power in the priesthood be upon me and my posterity throughout all generations of time and through all eternity." You supposedly have to give all of those handshakes and names to an angel to get into heaven.   You learn them at various parts of the temple "ceremony" and then at the end you go to the veil, which is basically just a curtain with holes in it. A guy sticks his hands through the holes and pretends to be an angel. You have to show him the handahakes and tell him the names, and then he will let you in. And if all this sounds super cultish and creepy, well, you're right."
exmormon,"Okay, I'm going to take a shot at this one:   Kolob is described in the Book of Abraham as being the creation nearest to God. This is confusing and deserves a little explanation.   A big theme of the Book of Abraham is classifying creations according to their status. It starts early in the book with God telling Abraham that he (A) was among the "noble and great ones" chosen before they were born to lead and direct His (G) creations.   This plays nicely into several Mormon doctrines: pre-mortal existence, possibility of pre-ordination, calling and authority as eternal, etc.   God then says everything has "intelligence" and can be classed accordingly:   >These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all.   Intelligence doesn't refer to actual intelligence. It's been described as the eternal "you." The part that directs your spirit, the part of you that is co-eternal with God. But I digress.   So, you as a human are more "intelligent" than a rock or bird, and God is more intelligent than you. Humans can increase until they become like Gods, inherit everything he has, etc.   Now, Kolob is ALWAYS talked about as if it was an actual, physical planet. As though God dwells in a specific place in the universe. Mormons say he has a corporeal, so He would have to BE somewhere, but this is another tangent.   So, Kolob is the "greatest" of His creations, but this doesn't really make sense. It's called the "governing" body, being the head of all the planetary creations in its same "species" of creation.   This has led to some interesting conclusions and idiotic statements by LDS prophets. For example, Joseph Fielding Smith Jr. said humans would never walk on the moon because it was a "higher" body than us. B Young said people lived on the sun because that was the purpose of governing bodies, blah blah blah.   Now, this probably sounds ridiculous now. Planets don't govern each other, and the entire thing sound like terrible astronomy.   However, you can look at it another way:   Kolob is symbolic of Jesus Christ. He is the nearest to God, his Firstborn, the one through whom humans must go to get to God, and the one most like God.   This explanation clears up the stupid facsimile "borrowing light" as well. Christ is the fountain of all truth and light, the conduit through which the Father pours out His Holy Spirit to humans.   Now, I have never heard the alt. explanation once, ever. Not in any book, class, or conference, so it's not by any means doctrinal. However, I think it's a better reading and interpretation of a particularly stupid piece of Mormon theology that has been treated as literal for far too long."
exmormon,"I believe this happened to you, I also believe it happens regularly to millions of other people in the world of all different faiths. What you felt was either indigestion, the timing sounds dead on after laying down, or most likely the endorphins resulting from the come down after a stressful event. There are explanations for your physical symptoms, odd that you would quickly attribute them to a supernatural source and presume that somehow means it is a message about mormonism. Maybe it was a message telling you your wife is an emotional maniplator and that you got played, hard."
exmormon,"Be proud of yourself. I'm 50 and it took that long to figure out that"
exmormon,"The mission in which my sister serves was just told by their mission president to "stay in your apartment until you know Joseph Smith was a prophet  as if you had lived when he had lived and had literarily seen him. "   Ok, lets pause here. You can believe that spiritual "knowledge" is superior to  actual  physical knowledge. Fine. I think that's ill-conceived, but whatever, you can make whatever value judgements you want. It's simply tautologically incorrect to say that you could get the experience of living around smith by doing anything but, you know, living around smith."
exmormon,"Yep.  And next time you're asked, maybe instead of saying something insulting or embarrassing (like another reply suggested), you could so everyone to kneel in a circle and hold hands.  Then follow that up with a sincere sounding prayer that starts with,   "Our most kind and gracious beloved Heavenly Father, we come before thee at this time with gratefulness in our hearts for all of the things which Thou has blessed us with, even our trials which make us stronger, because we know that Thou art nigh..."   You know when you start it like that that it's going to be really really long.  And when it ends with,   "In the name of Thy Son, who suffered for our abhorrent sins, whom we sacrifice afresh, and died on the cross that we may live with Thee for all eternity, even our dear Savior, the creator of this world and all things that in them are, all things bright and beautiful, all creatures great and small, even Jesus the Christ; Amen,"   that final Amen will be so firm and unshakeable that you will never be again asked to give the blessing on the food."
buildapcforme,"Honestly I can't really see the difference between a 120hz monitor and a monitor with a lesser refresh rate, The Asus has a refresh rate of 56-76 Hz but honestly I have 3 of them and I personally find them amazing for gaming etc... Increasing your refresh rate allows more states (of color) to be on the screen each second.

bapcsalescanada,"Getting real tired of not having a GPU. I had a Visiontek 6950, worked great except it had a weird, and very loud grinding noise. Performance was unaffected, but since I had lifetime warranty I figured I'd RMA it and get rid of the horrible sound. After $35 shipping and a week, I get a card back. Plop it in my machine, boot it up, performance isn't nearly close to my original card. Weird. Then full screen corruption. Over time it got to the point where it won't even boot anymore, and my motherboard spits out errors referring to the GPU   Went to RMA again, was told by Visiontek support they would pay for shipping this time. Then when it came to actually RMAing, I was told they wont pay for shipping from Canada. At the same time I'm hit with a $15 import fee from Fedex.   So, another $50 to RMA and potentially get another broken card? Yeah, no. So i've been sitting here without a GPU, waiting for the 390x. No point in investing in a 970, 980 or 290x right now I suspect.   Frustrated. Rant."
Autoflowers,"I want to share a story of frustration, confusion, disgust, stupidity and finally hope!   A little while ago I noticed the beginnings of a cal mag deficiency and upped my dose of cal mag accordingly. Instead of getting better, it got worse and worse, starting on 1 plant and soon showing on 7 more. So I upped the dose again to no effect.   Then I noticed some fungus gnats, and on closer inspection I found a load more. How did I miss em? No idea, but at least I had an answer (or so I thought) to the problem.   Then it occurred to me that there was way too much damage to have been caused by these gnats - an infestation that caused damage like I was finding would have had clouds of them flying all round my tent and although they were plentiful, they weren麓t that bad.   So I did what I should have done from the start and started trouble shooting all parts of my set up. Now I have always had very hard tap water with a pH up to 10 (usually around 8-9 though) but I hadn麓t checked what it was coming out of the tap at for a while - I would just pH my water after mixing my nutes, and as I use pH Perfect nutes, my pH was always bang on the money.   I checked my tap water and it is now coming out of the tap at a steady pH 7, so my thoughts are that my normal dose of cal mag used to be fine because of the high mineral content of my water, but as my water quality changed, the minerals were much reduced, and so the deficiency grew quickly, and was made worse by the fungus gnats.   I waged war on the gnats. It was quick, bloody and left many casualties. The girls got a much increased doses of cal mag, and the damage seemed to slow down.   I think its finally under control and the damage, while bad, isn麓t catastrophic, I麓ve certainly lost some yield, and they aren麓t gonna win any beauty contests, but I am confident that they will limp over the finish line in a couple of weeks.   So my stupidity, coupled with a blase attitude almost cost me a tent full of buds. From now on I will be checking every aspect of my grow weekly and I have learned a big lesson!"

Philippines,"Hello! :) last month ko lang ito na-discover :)   I've been looking for bar stools for almost 5 months but they've always seemed unreasonably priced at P3K to P4K. I've checked literally everywhere and it's priced similarly be it Wilcon, SM, Home Depot, specialty stores, etc. So I found this place alongside Aurora blvd. They have bar stools that are EXACTLY the ones they sell in Dimensione at P3,800++ but they sell at JUST P1,800!! So of course I bought two.   I saw desks, closets, bookshelves, side tables, office tables, etc. there as well. In fact, I purchased the exact same office chair as my boyfriend but LESS P1,600.   You can check their online store (the name of the place is Nemie Furniture) to know first what piece you are actually interested in. But the whopping discounts are given in store. They drop prices at the THOUSANDS.   Medjo rock and roll yung place kasi dusty and bodega-ish. But that's it. Yung sa Aurora friendly yung staff and the owners are there conducting the business themselves. Meron din silang bigger selection sa kanilang mga binders. You can be assured of product because they have to call sa factory to have it delivered. Trade-off is you wait 3-days. But that's it: Super awesome discounts, same product, also they deliver. :)"
Philippines,"It's training but it also goes deeper, the people working in the stores that you as a foreigner shop in are likely to be earning a wage with which they will never be able to afford the items you are purchasing from them. They have no reference, I worked in retail and hospitality during most of my adolescent years, and i come from what i consider to be an upper middle class western european family. I was accustomed to the products and services I was supplying and therefore had atleast some background knowledge about what was and was not expected from me. This problem is not just something that happens in the Philippines but something i ran into in a lot of developing countries. stores and restaurants are staffed by inexperienced and untrained people all over the world but in more developed countries the staff has some sort of reference of what is expected of them.   edit: also i have the impression that children from a middle/upper class family in the Philipines have 0 incentive to work these jobs and thus are not able to help train their less fortunate peers.   edit2: the"
Philippines,"Besides the fact that workers who arent used to dealing with foreigners may be intimidated/uncomfortable dealing with you, most of the problem is cultural.  In the Philippines workers arent as proactive as those in the US/Europe.  They are given very little control at work so they dont expect/aren't expected to go out of their way to do more than what they are paid to do (stand there, watch for shoplifters, give a marginal amount of help to customers).  There are other cultural norms such as indirect speech, more reliance on body language for communication, the avoidance of embarrassment and a collective instead of individual approach to problem solving that also come into play."

Hope your building code's up to scratch because shit's gonna liquefact.   Frankly, people (and you OP) should be asking: IS MY HOUSE ON A STURDY FOUNDATION, and more importantly, IS MY BUILDING SAFE/FOLLOWING BUILDING CODE?   Also, that line should be seen as a ZONE, an APPROXIMATION, where several SMALLER FAULTS could lie underneath and could move as well. You could actually see it in some parts of the map where there are several ones that are parallel each other.

My dog was about 10 yards off my property into the street and a family living 1/2 mile down the street called in a complaint. I had never met the family before. Everyone in the neighborhood loved my dog. The dog is a collie, and the most mild mannered loving dog on the planet. The officer who responded to the complaint was baffled that anyone would call in a complaint on the dog. But he was bound by procedures to write the ticket. I had an appearance date to plead non-guilty or guilty, I plead guilty in front of a judge (ticketing officer told me it was just a $100 fine!!!), met with a sentencing interviewer, and then was sentenced to a 90 day suspended jail time and $500 fine."

Winnipeg,"Sad fact is giving the homeless housing won't work or solve anything more then feeding them does, it serves the short term Soultion of putting food in there bellies and a safe place to stay the night- which is great but don't expect that person to all the sudden wake up and become a productive citizen, the next sad fact is they never ever will regardless of what ANYONE does for them- they will generally return to that life style. We should support places like siolam mission where they feed the homeless, give them a safe place to sleep for the night and offer some medical services, but support them with the understand we are providing basic needs and not solutions, don't expect a solution from that it is an unrealistic expectation to have and you will just be disappointed. If people really want to "solve" this it's time to get real and have realistic solutions, the adults are generally past the point of return, we should keep providing those basic needs as listed before (because we are caring humans, never lose/forget that) but start switching the main focus to youth so they don't grow up like that in the first place. There is many reasons someone might be homeless but there is demographics in Winnipeg we can identify where the majority of those homeless come from."

Winnipeg,"Thanks fo that info. It sounds like some interesting research.   Since you asked, a bit more detail about some of the main problems I see...   I don't think the website is doing a good job at communicating anything. Case in point, the fact that the website has an extensive "about" page. A good website is self explanatory. When I initially clicked around the website, I really had no clue what it was about, period. Now that you've explained a little about the background, I am still lost. The overall information architecture and content strategy is very top down, it seems to targeting an audience that's already familiar with the subject.   The most important technical problem with the site would be it's overal decency on flash. The swf load up times are way too slow, the use of flash is needlessly weighing down the site. More specifically though, the "explorer" you linked is a terrible navigation device. Here are some of the problems with it:     The browser back button is disabled on this page   None of the sub-sections are linkable and therefore do not create a browser history. Not only is this bad for usability, it's bad SEO.    For topics with a lot of sub-topics (ex. "poverty") there isn't enough space to show all the subtopics, so the designer has chosen to hide some topics behind others. This forces the user to hunt and peck to discover all of the topics. Site navigation is not a game, it needs to be extremely straightforward.     The inter-connecting lines between the topics muck up the whitespace and confuse me.     Some topics (ex. "market basket") are buried 3 or more levels deep, users do not have the patience for that much clicking.   The fact that you're able to get to the same topic via multiple parent topics makes it more difficult for a returning visitor to duplicate their actions, in turn making finding content a potentially frustrating experience."

magicTCG,"I've been running this deck with doomed travelers instead of delvers for the past couple days. They seem to work well, but the opponents don't really care too much if they're getting pinged for one a turn, so they don't kill them. So I looked for an alternative, and delvers were a strong choice. I wasn't too convinced they were better, so i asked Reddit, hence le thread. I wanted to eventually get some Snapcasters in for more control.   I will probably take out the Looters when i get snaps and ponders in, but for now they are working extremely well at getting the flashback of Unburial Rites going turn 4 for the Reavers. I've also had ridiculous success with the Kindred, as it potentially brings out a Dungeon geist for more lockdown, a captain for buffs, a geist of saint traft for the trickery itself provides, as well as the Reavers, which give ridiculous draw power and board control when hexproof and buffed to 6/8 double strike.   I will definitely try out the Midnight Hauntings, but I'm unsure of what to take out exactly.   I have had problems with board wipes, but that can always be sideboard hated against.   And if reanimator becomes a problem, a couple Nihil Spellbombs / Extractions can always be sided in."

magicTCG,"When an ability like "regenerate this creature" resolves, all it does is wait until the creature would die that turn.   THEN, if it would die, at the that time, it prevents that. In order for that to matter, it does a few extra things.   First, it removes all damage. That's important, otherwise a creature regenerating from lethal damage would immediately die again.   Then, it does two other things which basically allow a player to remove the creature for a turn even if it does regenerate. Those two things are: tap the creature (if it has not yet attacked at the time it would die, it can't normally attack after regenerating) and remove it from combat (if it hasn't already done combat damage, that would keep it from dealing combat damage). These other two effects aren't things it needs to do, they're just effects that balance regeneration, and perhaps add a little flavor."
magicTCG,"I just want to say a few things here. SCG has handled each of the issues you've highlighted almost exactly as you would expect a business to handle them:   "Banning other vendors from their event to corner the market."   I don't understand how you could consider this them banning other vendors from their personal events. They put out all of the money for things such as venues, prizes, and staffing. Why are they under some mandate to allow other vendors at their events? The other large-market retailers could run their own tournament series and be the only vendor. SCG is just the only site whose decided to do it (TCGPlayer hosts a collection of vendors much like their website's model).   "Rampant cheating among their top players."   The most notorious of these issues have been events surrounding Alex Bertoncini, Edgar Flores, and that guy who drew the batterskull from the bottom of his deck. Bertoncini is still serving the remainder of his 18-month ban. Elden (Batterskull man) is still serving his 18-month suspension. Flores served a 6 month suspension in 2012 and has come back recently to T4 a Grand Prix. What more do you want from them other than to catch the cheaters that they can and punish them accordingly? Actually, how can you even fault SCG for people cheating in their events? That isn't in their control and it is going to happen in every facet of competitive play.   "Canceling people's orders when prices go up."   Do you have some hard proof of this happening to you? Because I have proof of the opposite. Back when Valakut was unbanned in Modern I ordered 8 copies of each Prismatic Omen @ 3.49 each and Wargate @ 0.75 each. I attempted to use Paypal to finalize the payment, but after an error in paypal processing, the cards we're removed from their inventory and I thought I was just boned. I received a call 3 days later while in Atlanta for the SCG Invitational (I live in Philadelphia) from their customer service department asking if i still wanted the cards at the price they had been advertised at. I gave them a CC over the phone and got my cards within a week.   I will say a friend of mine did have an order canceled for Second Sunrise after PT RTR. Ben Bleiweiss (Basically SCGs #2) came out and said that the order was mishandled from how they normally treat things like this. My friend received his cards shortly afterwards. Read it all here:   "Shady judge calls at their events."   I've been playing competitively for about 7-8 years now. After playing in about 10 SCG Open events over the past few years, I have noticed nothing "shady" about rulings given during these events. Sure, every once in a while, judges get things wrong. I've seen bad rulings happen at all levels of the game, and it is just a part of the game when it comes down to it. I can't say for certain whether "shady" stuff goes down or not, but I know I haven't seen it. I would also believe the onus is on the accuser to cite specific examples when throwing around accusations like this."
magicTCG,"Unless your creatures are going to directly impact combat somehow.  (Haste, pumping your guys, etc.), by attacking first you may force your opponent to make a decision.  For example, the defending player has 3 mana up and both an Azorius charm in hand and a dissipate.  If he uses his mana in combat to bounce your guy, perhaps you can cast a creature without it being countered.   The reverse is true as well; maybe we'll hold off on using that Azorius charm, just in case you cast a nasty spell in Main Phase 2.  If you always wait, your opp doesn't know if you are planning to just pass the turn or do something else."
magicTCG,"It's not a hard and fast rule, there are some creatures you might want to play before combat (ex. Goblin Warchief, Hellrider, etc). Those creatures tend to have haste and/or affect combat.   One reason could be playing around your opponents combat tricks like Wing Shards or Peel from Reality. Let's say you have a grizzly bears in your hand, and 3 creatures on the board. Playing it before combat has no real impact. If you enter your combat phase and your opponent has a Blustersquall (which she casts with overload) will leave you with no blockers for the next turn. If you cast it after combat you can at least block with a Grizzly Bears.   Another reason could be to play a combat trick or pretend that you have combat trick in your hand. This could be a Giant Growth, Restoration Angel, or Necrobite, etc. The more cards you have in your hand the more likely your opponent would have to assume you have something to affect combat, but it also ensures that you can play your trick when you need to as well.   It can also play around Counterspell. It forces your opponent to make a decision to make a play now or take damage to make a play later in the turn. If your opponent is playing some sort of UW control deck with Counterspells and flash creatures and combat instants, then attacking first is forcing your opponent to let you know whether he or she has a counterspell or not. If your opponent just takes the damage with a fistful of cards, then you can be fairly certain that they have a counterspell (or at least really bluffing it). This is valuable information in a game.   So, those a few reasons. But ultimately it comes down to the fact that if it won't make an impact at that point, you should limit the information you give to your opponent until you have to. As you can see playing or not playing creature before combat reveals a lot. At the very least, you have one less card in your hand, and a little less mana available to you."
magicTCG,"These feel like they all relate to a certain "archetype" of player, alas:   1) Stop loudly fiddling with your cards in hand during my turn, you wretch. Put them down on the table and let me think in peace. I get that you do that because it's your way of directing "thinking stress" and/or you are emulating some "pros" you saw on a stream, but please have the self awareness to stop doing that during my turn. It's annoying and unnecessary. In before: "Nurhurhur! That's why we do it, psychological warfare! :B"   2) Verbal declarations of self perceived advantages or "dominance." Every case I've seen this happen tends to be meshed with childish butt hurt when the delusions are torn down. Guy won't stop jerking himself off about his "crazy board position" and that "it's good game for somebody on my next turn." Mood shifts from "I'm extremely cocky" to "you killed my dog" when that sweet board state is swept off the table.   The best example of this happening was during a local legacy tournament. I had been on hiatus due to work for a month or two, where new guy decided to start showing up to the shop. He is relatively new to legacy, but has already picked up something of a name for himself in cocksure attitude. I dragged out a combo elves list I've had rotting on a shelf for a long while, showed up, and got paired with him.   He was playing some iteration of The Rock or Junk (Goofies, confidants, removal, yadda yadda). First game I don't do much but fart out 1/1 elves and get dumpster banged. "Elves doesn't have a good match up versus me!" Second game I have another horrendous slow start, but sandbag a hand of elves and glimpse until I can explode off three lands into a hard cast Emrakul.   Suddenly -silence- and -everything is on the line- as if I am witnessing a man defusing a bomb and any mistake will cost him his life. I get a "regular" turn 3 blow out and summon the Kooldrazi. Wouldn't shake my hand, instead indignantly digging out three engineered plague from his deck and throwing them down on the table in front of me as a visual aid to himself explaining I "should not win because I have these in my deck, you got lucky." Give me a break, guy (I run a wishboard for that kind of thing! :3).   3) Honestly going to extend the first belly ache with this: I -really- loathe the habits "pro scenes" have invoked in local players. Stop diddling with your cards loudly, you look like you are on meth.  Stop mechanically drawing and moving your cards around as if you are invoking the sacred rites of the .1% efficiency Goddess, you just look like a tool.  Also, get your grubby mitts off my deck! I shuffled it a crap load, right in front of you, using a variety of methods, and all you need to do is cut it. You don't need to cut it four times, shuffle it, and randomize it again as if I'm some sort of MTG card shark that has spent my incredible gift on durdling with cards at a local tournament.  No, I don't know about so and so player or why he thinks the card I am killing you with is a suboptimal choice. No, please don't explain it to me."
magicTCG,"Probably a bit late for this, and I'm getting better at it, but I'm still not even perfect. It's just something you notice when you are trying not to do it yourself. Can we please set the record straight that it is Play, then pay? As I recall, and was taught by a friend of mine, the proper process is to play then pay.   The worst bit about it is someone seeing you do it the correct way and then saying you're doing it wrong. Or, someone trying to tell you how to play the game and not knowing themselves."
magicTCG,"WG travel preps. Try to get like 16+ creatures with as many 2 drops as possible. Getting 3 travel preps isn't out of the question, but 2 is still great. my favourite sequence in the set is turn 3 end step Midnight Haunting into travel preps. Your opponent won't see it coming.   I'm also very fond of the UG self mill deck. Start working on drafting a decent blue deck by taking silent departures, stitched drakes or whatever, then dive in if you see any of the finishers. The deck's strategy is made up of two parts. Enablers and finishers. The enablers are cards like Deranged Assistant, Armored Skaab, Dream Twist, Mulch and Ghoulcaller's Bell pretty much in that order (dropping the bell is pretty understandable, but I like it more than most people seem to). The big finisher is Spider Spawning. It's an uncommon, and most of the others are rares. You want to hold off on this as long as you can without dying. I like using gnaw to the bone to help me survive. The deck has a hump of sorts, where it starts off somewhat slow before picking up steam. The other potential finishers are Kessig Cagebreakers, and Boneyard Wurm. If you see Splinterfright, you're laughing. I'd take this above almost anything, because it's both an enabler as well as a finisher. The biggest advantage to this deck is that most of the cards you need are unplayable or borderline unplayable in other decks. You can really work this to your advantage though, by taking cards that aren't as good for you earlier because the better card for you isn't as great for everyone else. For example, Deranged Assistant is pretty good in other decks, but spider spawning is pretty mediocre, despite being more integral to our strategy. There's actually a combo you can draft. Memory's Journey, and Runic Repetition work so that you can deck yourself and survive. This is good because it means you can just mill yourself as fast as possible without worrying about losing, but also because it means you can load up on enablers and you only need very few finishers. Since Memory's Journey can be flashed back, you don't even need to worry about drawing the combo. Oh yeah, don't forget to draft plenty of creatures. It doesnt matter too too much what they are, but it doesn't work that well if you're struggling for bodies in the yard.   wow long."
magicTCG,"In regards to Sorin, he was and never will be truly good. He is Lawful Evil. He won't think twice about killing anyone foolish enough to get in his way, and sangromancy in general is pretty brutal. He does however have the multiverses best interest at heart - just because your evil as shit doesn't mean you can't care the world(s) ending.   Take Zendikar for example. First, Sorin, Ugin and another planeswalker sealed them away. Then, he came back with Nissa Ravine and Anowan to keep them contained. But you have you delve deep into that story to truly understand Sorin's motivations."
magicTCG,"I discovered Magic back in the Future Sight days and I loved it. As we all know, FS set was not a very good set for a newcomer (I was also just starting my graduation). I restarted playing mtg about six months ago and I'm trying MTGO now, bought it this weekend (it took almost three days, since, for some ridiculous reason, they have problems with paypal). So, I'll say my impressions about MTGO beta version; the only experience I have with the Current version is because some videos I watch.   I don't know how Wizards is doing such a clunky old-fashioned program in 2013. Not only their online program, but their whole approach towards marketing seems old. Their client has absolute no community integration (twitter, facebook, google+, icq, orkut, whatever); I can not see spells' targets without having to navigate the mouse over the stack; I can not put my hand (my cards rectangle) wherever I want, same with pretty much everything. I can not have the cards in the board in the size I want without having to make the cards in my hand minuscle. I can not choose a place in the board to be my 'enchantments place' or my 'planeswalkers place', they will always be together. I mean, the whole space in my screen does not look very well optimized and I can't change the configuration of anything. Please, make a graveyard (or exiled cards, reavealed cards, etc) hotkey, so I can just get rid of that lost space and open the graveyard with the hotkey when I need; it would be so much cleaner!...   I have a lot more complainments to make, not only about mtgo, but about wizards approach to their community. Concerning mtgo, I realize the number of features I'm asking for is big, but none of them should be too hard for a good computer games company to make (specially for the price we pay in this thing: $10 just for the account + a lot to be able to play even any of the worse formats (10 for momir lol). I know the basics of Magic, but any new person to it would just throw it away in the first 15 mins of staring at the client).   About Wizards: I come from the Dota2 community. Maybe that is too much to ask for, but Valve does A LOT to make their community happy with the game. I mean, things we say in reddit about how this or that feature would be good for the game or for the viewers in twitch streams, for example, are implemented in the next Thursday! I am not asking for a weekly update like that, I know things can take more time, but look at the the Magic coverage in the streams: it is terrible. The mtgo client is terrible. I am sorry to say this, but for the PRICE and time put into MTG to get such a ridiculous game is laughable. I also completely agree with this video   I really want to love this game, but Wizards some times makes it difficult."
magicTCG,"He didnt misunderstand after you showed him you were right and that is how it worked. he just didnt realize he was playing agianst something he felt was cheap and felt cheated.   There are always combos that people get frustrated with to great extremes and your going to run into them. Everyone has a flavor of deck that they find they hate going against.   All that i can advise you do is either tell them before hand or during their confusion.   If you are going to play a deck of the extreme types try to give a fair warning without giving any tactical details away. ( im not sure how, be creative, maybe tell them its a more serious deck is it ok that you use it )   or when they start to question let them know that you will answer them with sources to enlighten them and if they desire to drop the match thats ok with you. you want to show them that you can understand and relate to the ill feelings that arise towards our individual discomforts when facing a different style but also that your deck is fully functional, within the rules, and you would like to play with it if that's alright.   My brother uses a pretty broken deck called his white artifact deck. It uses wall of glare for its defenses, and some other broken white creatures that help abuse some equipment to make it flying, unblockable, shroud, double strike, trample, paired with inquisitor flail. if its blocked its attack gets massive and steam rolls you. he can do this in a few turns. the amount of damage he is able to do was questioned so many times and everyone hates that deck. i take every game light hearted but i can say ive been annoyed with how broken it is so i made my own broken deck suited for the purpose of smashing that deck into the ground faster than it could ramp up. we both enjoy fighting these two decks against each other every once in a while."
magicTCG,"Judges live chat has informed my playgroup before that, AFTER I DECLARED A BLOCKER, using Isochron Scepter imprinted with Blustersquall in response was legal in order to prevent it from blocking. I argued that no, the block is declared, but now the creature is tapped. They threw a fit and went to judge's live chat, and got that answer.   They're not always right, I pulled out the comprehensive rules and showed them the relevant sections, and to this day they don't believe me. "Judge said so."   I don't play with that group anymore."
magicTCG,"Subjective.     Standard and rotating sets out has made the game a paper-chase where expensive cards can be de-valued overnight and useless(The 'strictly better' phenomenon).     Subjective, again. The Vorthos angle of telling a story dominates the game in so that for example, In NP it's stupid to play anything BUT Phyrexians.     Blue is the worst, even though they re-printed JTMS and a bunch of other crap in FTV. Standard isn't the end-all-be-all.     The game's not just about competition. It's majority of players are casual, even those competitive types play casually also.     'New' cards tend to be re-named cards. Abilities also. Witness Chroma and the new Theros mechanic.     [There are 27 cards that allow you to take an extra turn.](     The obvious solution is to print a equivalent JTMS in other  colors. WoTC profit is irrelevant here.     Ignorance = bliss.     Like I said, Punk kids.     Subjective...again."
magicTCG,"By the numbers:     Yes the rules have changed, no they haven't made the game worse.     It's always been expensive to play competitively. It's still expensive to play competitively. You cannot "buy wins" any more than you could  before.     Storyline is a part of most sets, it doesn't dominate nor do "wotc chosen colors" dominate standard. This standard season has seen literally every colour in a tier one deck. Literally every single colour at some point.     Blue is the worst it's been since I started playing this standard season. Compared to caw-blade or delver this has been positively blue light.     Yes, there's will be about 15 good playable standard cards in any set. That's how competition works, you want to find the best cards, not play all the cards.     Most cards, outside of core sets are new and even in core sets there are a good number of new cards.     There are very few cards that say "take another turn" and most of them are unplayable.     Some cards are banned in modern and legacy mostly because they break the format/ force everyone to play the same deck if they want any hope of winning. Wotc would likely profit more in the short term by unbanning jtms ... Long term? No.     The game has more players than ever before, that doesn't sound like the hallmark of a ruined game     ... Punk kids? Really? 'cause magic's still mostly a game for people in their late twenties.     I've found people to be generally very friendly and helpful to new players, you mileage may vary and there are always dicks but for the most part, mtg players are decent human beings sharing a hobby."
magicTCG,"I think it would hinder a lot of professional and competitive players not knowing the whole set before anyone gets their hands on the cards.   Now I'm not talking about the guy at FNM that's playing UWR Control with a full set of foil Snapcaster Mages. I'm talking about actual pro players such as Brian Kibler, Tomoharu Saito, LSV, Sam Black among a few. I'm talking about the grinders like Jeff Hoogland, Gerry Thompson, Brad Nelson. These players test and brew extensively to find the best combination of cards to play in their next Open or GP. Part of testing is figuring out what cards and interactions to be wary of and watch out for.   Let's go back to M14 and imagine Burning Earth wasn't spoiled. Day of the prerelease, Tommy Lucksack opens one in his prerelease packs, and 2 more in his prize packs. Fast forward a week, and he's brewed up a monored deck featuring his 3 Burning Earths and takes it to an GP in your home town featuring the new Standard environment. He takes the top tables, on a rampage, because no one was expecting Burning Earth, while everyone was playing UWR control, Jund Midrange and Junk Rites. He takes the whole Open down because no one else knew about Burning Earth. Including you, who he beat with his 3 Burning Earths because you were playing Junk Tokens and couldn't cast Lingering Souls without taking a 3 damage.   It would be amazing for a surprise like opening a Stormbreath Dragon at the event. But if you're one of the lucky ones to know about it, everyone else is at a great disadvantage."
magicTCG,"Phylatery Lich - Yes, T1 dark ritual into Phylacery Lich and Relic is definitely the best card for the job.   Moot point, because it also has the upside of not eating a car slot in the decklist.     Not banned in modern, no, but modern's a competitive format which means you have to have quite a very good reason to play a card.   Being indestructible and being used as sacrifice fodder aren't exactly synergistic, and it's no better at this job than, say, Mox Opal which can be used to cast said spells.   Affinity has Ornithopter and Memnite, which are both better in that deck.  Not to mention older stuff like Mox Opal or Shield Sphere or Phyrexial Walker.     This synergizes with Darksteel Juggernaut no more than any other artifact.   See the affinity comment.   See affinity and metalcraft.   Yes, though the artifact lands were common, and there are plenty of uncommon 0-drops.     >Well, it is both of those.     Exactly.       The only thing it has going for it is that it's the intersection of these two traits.  If there's an application that requires a 0-drop artifact AND where indestructibility is more relevant than a body or mana AND where using an extra card is better than having it be Darksteel Citadel, then Darksteel Relic is definitely the card for the job.  As I stated at the start, the turn one lich is the only situation that comes to mind where Relic is the best option.  But if you're not dropping him turn one, he'd much rather have a Darksteel Axe.   As for EDH, there are no shenanigans in the format that would benefit from Darksteel Relic other than what you've listed above.  I play a ton of commander (and actually ran a 0-color deck at one point), so that's coming from experience.  A lot of people like to assume that the format has weird obnoxious interactions you can't see anywhere else, but that's not really the case.  It's an interesting cross between the power of Legacy and the shenanigans of kitchen table magic, but anything you can do in commander you can do in a casual deck.   It's definitely a Johnny card, no question there.  And a top-notch vorthos card as well.  Timmy is kind of a stretch, since Timmy looks to make big splashy plays with beaststicks and X spells and token swarms, but I don't see the "big awesome effect" appeal of Relic."
magicTCG,"I remember my first FNM back in Feburary. Went 2-2. Dimir Mill homebrew with Consuming abberation, rouge's passage, Essence Harvest, & Jace's Phantasms.   Swept by Jund Goodstuff R1 by one of the regulars. Huntmaster, Liliana, Oliva, Thrasktusk, etc. Yep, wasn't too graceful about it but whatever.   1-1 draw with Esper Control. Game 1 got milled with Nephalia, G2 beat him down with Abberation, couldn't finish G3 so he gave me the win and told me to have fun (and I've always remembered this gesture)   Lost to Golgari Beatdown with Lotleth troll, Deadbridge and Garruk. Ended up beating my friend (Rakdos Aggro) in the last round on the backs of two Jace's Phantasms."
magicTCG,"If you are new to Magic, /r/cockatrice is a helpful program to try out decks and get used to playing magic. It really helped me get from a novice to intermediate almost overnight! I practiced drafting on cockatrice about 30 times before going to my FNM for draft. My 2nd time drafting in real life and I won! I did split the prize pool but played for the promo card (sin collector) which I won. I did get very lucky but if you want some practice for FNMs or Mtg in general, cockatrice is a free mtg online program for those that don't know already!"
magicTCG,"I know i didn't have to, i just wanted to. Not so much for me, but to explain the other side to the players. I think if everyone knows all the information we can all be better consumers and create a better economy for the game.   We do make money from sheer volume of sales like you suggest, and the higher than MSRP products that I am talking about are the ones of limited quantity, where volume cannot make up more profit simply because there is no more volume to had.   I literally can only sell 2 blue decks a week because that is all I can order. I'll sell those for what i need too and make my profit on the back end selling the unwanted decks for their MSRP at $30. Eventually all of those decks will sell, and if they are already paid for, than I can let them sit and it wont cost me anything. Meanwhile all the stores that sold theirs cheaper, or gave them away, basically just gave up on that profit. Which is absolutely fine, perhaps that giveaway helped their event turnout or whatever, it's all cool."
magicTCG,"The thing that basic supply and demand leaves out is dead inventory.   I run the books for a small business, and dead inventory is the bane of my existence.  Say I've got 6 sets of Commander 2013.  The Mind Seize and Eternal Bargain decks are going to fly off the shelves.  I'm reasonably certain that I can move Evasive Maneuvers, and maybe Nature of the Beast.   But fucking Power Hungry.  It's gonna take a long, long time for me to move Power Hungry.   That means that the shelf space that 6 Power Hungry decks are taking up can't be used for anything else.  That's terrible.  That shelf space isn't free.  Even usable piece of the shop has expenses to cover--rent, utilities, staff wage/benefits, insurance, everything that's required just to keep a business open.  That's what it costs to have  an empty shelf .  To put a product on it costs whatever the Vendor price is.  With an MSRP of $30 a piece, those six Power Hungry decks have cost me $90 on top of the shelf space.  The longer they sit there, the more they cost me.  Those Mind Seize and Eternal Bargain decks?  They were there for three days.  They cost me three days worth of shelf maintenance money.  The Power Hungrys cost months and months worth.  Months that could have gone to high value, high mobility merchandise like miniatures or other Magic cards.   But wait, there's more!  Commander 2013 came out at the end of the year, which means that those Power Hungrys are still in the store on December 31st.  That means that, as liquidatable, active inventory (I'm in manufacturing, and I know that our inventory no longer counts as "active" if it hasn't been sold in four years; I don't know the exact timeframe for retail), meaning that they count towards the total value of my business  and I have to pay taxes on them.   Those Mind Seize and Eternal Bargains decks?  I didn't have to include them in my yearly statement because they were  fucking gone.   Sure, I have to charge sales tax, but I'm gonna do the same to those Power Hungrys if they ever sell."
magicTCG,"That's cute. I live in Cleveland, I have 8-9 card shops I can go here to play magic. If I wanted to, I could play standard and limited competitively every single day of the week, and still not visit half the stores around me.   None of the stores here sell packs for below $4. There's the rare "3 for 11" deal sometimes, but that's it. There's only one store in this area that sells booster boxes for under $100 now. Only TWO of the stores even employ people (by that I mean almost all of the stores are literally ran by the owner alone), so that expense is non-existent. Most of them have shitty prize support, and if their prize support is decent the store itself either has a crappy player base or the owners will try and fuck you over a different way, like preying on new players or gullible people."
magicTCG,"One special item isnt paying their bills. Its a one time money grab that is disgusting to me as a consumer.   Whoa. "Disgusting"? FTV is an  extremely  limited edition product with extremely valuable cards inside, generally worth more for the buyer to pull apart and immediately sell as singles than the inflated price that it was sold at in most stores that have it. Why would anyone sell anything for $40 when it is worth at least $120?   The point of FTV and its low MSRP is to give stores a profit bump, thereby keeping them happy, trading and providing their service to magic players. The purpose is not to give loads of players a foil Jace the Mind Sculptor at 1/4 of its market value, it's just a treat for the store and the handful of per store who might be able to afford it. My local actually gave out one of their FTV:20's as top prize of Theros Pre-Release but they didn't have to, they used it as a way to draw in more customers."
magicTCG,"Hi, glad to see more people joining the hobby.  So, everything said so far is true, deckbuilders toolkit good, fat packs good, prereleases good.  If you don't have a local game store yet then look [here]( The LGS is where you can go to buy mtg product, meet new players, play with others, and maybe, eventually, play in tournaments.  If you don't have an LGS close to you then send me a PM, I can give you some tips on buying Magic stuff without a game store nearby.   As soon as you can, start transitioning to [booster boxes]( for getting new packs.  This is the most cost effective way to open packs.  If you can't afford it right away try to find a friend to split a box with you, make sure you split the  packs  not the  cards .   When you buy packs always buy from the newest block, which is to say the cards released this year.  These cards will spend the longest time in [Standard]( which is the format with the most players.  Right now the Newest Sets are Theros and Born of the Gods FYI.   Avoid buying individual cards if at all possible.  Instead trade the ones you have either to the store or better yet to other players.  This will keep your actual money free for more booster boxes.  Get a binder that can hold your valuable cards that are for trade, take it with you if you go to the game store so you can trade.   When trading always remember to check whatever anyone says about card prices online, you can do that [here](  Only trade if you want to, and don't  ever  feel pressured to do a trade you don't like.  You are in control of your cards until you shake hands, no one else has a claim to them.   I would suggest learning to [draft]( because this is a way to both play the game and open more packs for value. If you want to learn to draft I would suggest using [Magic the Gathering Online]( for $10 you can do a bunch of really cheap drafts to get used to how drafting works.   As far as playing goes, I would suggest playing [Commander]( to start.  Commander is about big explosive multiplayer games and it is the  cheapest format for new players .  All you need to play Commander is a deck designed built for the format, and Magic just happens to sell really good prebuilt [decks]( for around [$20]( ready to play.   This hobby can be overwhelming to take in at first, but the main reason I see people quit playing magic is that they get screwed out of all their cards in trades or they get convinced to spend way too much money before they even learn what everything is worth.  I started playing only about a year ago and today magic is my favorite hobby.  Have fun and end wisely.  Find videos and articles online that explain the different aspects of the hobby and find some friends who like to play.  Soon you will be established in Magic and you can help other new players get started in magic.   Waaaaaaaay"
magicTCG,"On the other side of this coin, those stores who are unwelcoming to the new guy can be a huge turn-off.  I had a friend who was in the process of learning, had played maybe four games and had an intro pack as his first deck.  He asked the sales associate for advice on what to buy for his "swamps and mountains deck", and was answered with a blank, sardonic stare.  I now cannot convince this guy to buy singles because he thinks he'll get made fun of for not knowing stuff, and he ends up wasting money buying boosters.  Instead of jumping on the double-opportunity to help a new player and create a lasting customer relationship, this person chose to be insular and unhelpful.  While this is the most vivid example of shoddy customer service from that store in my experience, there were several incidents preceding it of similarly inattentive and   apathetic staff behavior.  This runs 100% against the atmosphere average customers expect from an LGS.  The thought process is something like "I don't know what to do.  I'll go to the store and ask them; they'll know!".  The stores that do well are the ones that play into this.  "Yes, come to us, ask us your questions, let us sell you everything you need :)".   This has become a ramble - the first LGS I ever frequented was a neighborhood store in my hometown.  My experiences at that store still define what I think an LGS should be.  The store owner is an incredibly amiable fellow who would teach anyone who asked to play Magic.  If you had money to spend, but no idea what to spend it on, you could give him some themes and a budget and he would build a deck for you.  It was clear that he was an active part of the store's Magic community, but he never allowed this to obscure the perception that he was running the store.  Mid-game he would excuse himself to greet/assist customers and was the kind of guy who would actually try to help Mom find an appropriate present for Timmy, instead of just trying to sell her expensive cards.  13 years later, that same guy is still running the store and I go there as often as I am able because there is no doubt that I will receive excellent service."
magicTCG,"I started playing MTG two weeks before Dragon's Maze came out. I splurged on Jund Midrange, Bant Hexproof and American Control for Standard at the time. (I didn't know about rotation when I started). When rotation did come when Theros was released, I played Orzhov Midrange/Control until I got sick of seeing Mono-Black devotion everywhere, so I traded EVERYTHING that was a Standard staple that wasn't seeing play in Modern into Modern staples.   Luckily, I had most of the shocks from the Return to Ravnica block and Snaps, Restos, Voices, Geists, Hierarchs and Lilis from the INN-RTR standard decks, so it was just a matter of getting cards like Goyfs, Bobs and fetches, among other things. Glad I made the switch :) Don't get me wrong, I would love to play Standard, but I don't like punching my wallet in the balls every time rotation comes around.   Oh yeah, the first modern decks I traded into were Melira Pod and American Control. From there, I continued trading/slowly acquiring staples for other decks to where I can build whatever I want now. Took a while, but it was worth it.   If you want advice on how you can transition into these formats, try and get staples for Modern and Legacy currently in Standard when they rotate out so you get them at (hopefully) their lowest price when the Standard-only players are offloading everything. Hold onto cards that you think you might play in Modern so you won't ( need to get them in the future, especially if there's a price spike in the future (e.g. Abrupt Decay)."
magicTCG,"I built ur storm. Then they banned seething song. I continued to play it after Finkel t16ed a gp. Built it online. Played a ptq and gp with it(losing win and ins both times)  switched to twin. Got 2nd at the first event I played it."
magicTCG,"As much as I like starting with a cheap deck, one thing I learned. I moved from cheap deck to cheap deck and by the time I decided to test and build a competitive modern deck, I had spent way more money on cheap deck than I should have. Money that could have gone to making the competitive deck I have now. So I would say test to find the one you want and pick up pieces over time."
magicTCG,"Well, FNM isn't casual, it is a competitive environment. There are rules to follow and there is a judge or TO there to give out rulings when needed. At the same time, it isn't a grand tournament and is welcoming to new players. People are generally nice about it and will help their opponents, correct their mistakes and what not. Since money is on the line, don't expect people to go easy on you, and if they do help, it'll probably be after the match."
magicTCG,"as long as your goal is to have fun, you are good enough. If your goal is to win, then you need to practice and have a strong deck, and at that point you are still good enough and need to go in order to get good enough to win."
magicTCG,"It's a hard question to answer because how competitive a FNM is varies wildly from store to store.   Some stores have free FNMS that only have FNM foils as prizes. More often than not these are pretty low key, and as long as you have an ok grasp on the basic rules of the game you'll be just fine.   Other stores have $5-10 entry fees, higher prize payouts and thus are much more likely to be more cutthroat. In such cases, the people you're playing will be more serious. Because of this you'll need a better grasp on the rules to make sure not only that you're able to go with the flow of the game, but that you're not getting cheated. It's at this level where you'll have some people not remind you about triggers and such so that they can eek out an advantage because you forgot it. (They won't tell you this, because it's failure to maintain game-state and a big no no on their part, but they walk a very fine rules-lawyering line.)   The unfortunate thing is that without actually going, it's unlikely you'll know exactly what the vibe is at your local places to play.   What also comes into play is your personality and how you're able to enjoy the game. If you can play and lose every single game and still feel good about the night- either because you did something clever with your deck or because you learned a lot, then you'll be just fine to go to just about any FNM.   If you're a poor loser that can't stand to lose and put too much value into what the end result is- then you may need to be slightly more cautious about where you go to play."
magicTCG,"This is a problem, I've noticed, in any play environment when there is anything of value on the line. I run a weekly event at my LGS called "beginner magic" because it is a college town with lots of people that want to learn or improve, but get consistently crushed by net decks at fnm. There are some regulars that play in beginner magic that are not really beginners, but they do it because it is an environment when there is nothing on the line or at stake. Only then do you really root-out the players who take the game too seriously. In this environment people chat and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of cards, but they don't feel entitled to win just because their deck sees more competitive play. I saw a similar thing happen when my LGS did a limited pauper magic series, and it was a free tournament with a small prize for first but $1 in store credit for everyone who participated. That was the most pleasant semicompeditive tournament I had ever played, because as soon as you aren't in contention for first, no one really cares how well they do."
magicTCG,"Yes. Because they can tap it to pay a  cost . Whereas you can only tap is as part of the  resolution  of a spell or ability.   You would, e.g., pay mana to cast a spell that taps their creature. The mana is just gone. It simply leaves your mana pool. Then the tap effect goes on the stack.   In response they can place their creature's activated ability on the stack. The cost of that ability is tapping. The tapping just happens. Then the ability (destroy target creature) goes on the stack.   Then, assuming you both pass priority, their effect happens, then your effect happens. But your effect doesn't do much, because it taps an already tapped creature."
magicTCG,"I had this issue earlier today when ordering from tcgplayer as well.  What it is, is that there is an option when you click on the optimizer that causes it to search for cards that are tcgplayer direct qualified.  If you are ordering multiple cards from different vendors this means that your order will be shipped in 1 package from tcgplayer directly.  Of course the drawback to this is that tcgplayer needs to have the cards in their stock in order to send them to you which sometimes results in cards being more expensive.   For example i was trying to order some wurmcoil engines from the new commander set earlier today.  When using the optimizer it went from the $7 commander version to the $14 promo version that tcgplayer had in their stock so that i would be able to take advantage of tcgplayer direct."
magicTCG,"I feel like one of the most damning things about this whole situation is that the only people I see coming to M谩rcio's defense are those with something at stake. In this situation, obviously you as his teammate can't be completely unbiased, but the top level players don't really have anything to gain from trying to call out cheating.   When I look at any open comments section relating to this incident the only defenders I see there are people who believe the reputation of their home country is tarnished due to this. Now anyone thinking logically does not think any lesser of Portugal, including the rest of the team, but I can understand being defensive if you believe people think otherwise.   Also, the large argument I see in open comments is that this is all just jealousy. I personally understand that everyone attending this event is better at Magic than me and hold no grudge for it, but I can believe that random people shouting "Cheater!" may be saying so for this reason. The only issue with that is people like Chapin, while maybe being a bit loose and gossip-y on social media, are already well renowned Magic players and I see no way they gain anything from trying to oust a cheater."
magicTCG,"I went to my first FNM at Deriums CCGs. I went with a starter deck with minor changes (BW Exalted). I expected a bunch of people like me (rookies). I got rolled over in the first round. 2nd game ended with more than a half hour left in the round. My opponent took out a notepad and discussed how to improve my deck with minimal investment.  He wrote down everything we discussed.  I made the adjustments and destroyed my friends (after dropping from that FNM).   2 years later I still play FNM and see him from time to time and think of how he could have done anything else, but he chose to teach me lessons it takes many people a long time to learn. I am now more successful than my friends who had been playing long before me."
magicTCG,"There is no extremely dominant deck   Referencing the most dominant deck that led to one of the most notable bans in Standard history is a pretty wide margin to base something on.

And lol, 25% of the format, what a diverse field.   >The swath of viable decks is very wide   Not really, see the percentage breakdown. Mardu and Abzan make up for nearly 40% of the format.

In the past 2 month, Abzan has been 25% and the past 2 weeks it's been 31%.   >Tier 1 budget options   UW Heroic I'll agree with. Boss Sligh is pretty miserable to play.

magicTCG,"There are strong build-around cards that make decks play differently. Because they play differently, it is hard to directly compare them.   Jeskai Ascendancy and Whip of Erebos are strong cards which can be built around, but those decks can also win without the card.   Further, giving equal (or roughly equal) color fixing to all color combinations allows a lot more possible decks and depth to those decks.   The last time we had anything like this was the tail end of Alara-Zendikar, when Jund had been knocked down a few pegs by Mythic and UW Superfriends, and we got some cool stuff like Jacerator, Turbo Lands, Pyromancer Ascension/Time Warp combo, Master Transmuter jank, Naya Vengevine, and a bunch of others. You know,  differently-playing  decks."
magicTCG,"What people and players don't understand is that overhead is a thing. Does that justify some prices? No, but it will absolutely impact prices. MOST LGS locations will be more expensive than TCG so that is a horrible example...heck even buylist is going to be cheaper than TCG.   This player needs to realize that store is not the best deal to be buying cards and to get them elsewhere. I had a similar situation locally to me where I went into the store with a printed out list of the cards I wanted from TCG. I had planned on paying a little extra and assumed the $125 in cards from TCG would probably be $150 (I was buying almost a full commander deck). Knowing I was asking for a LARGE quantity of cards and there is only one person there to pull cards for me I dropped off the list and let him do it at his leisure. I had to call him after 5 days and ask his progress. He said just a few more days is all he'd need. When I got the call and went to pick them up a few days later he wanted $225 for the list of cards. After telling him that I supported his store for 15 years and wanted to continue to support him I politely told him I couldn't and wouldn't pay almost double what I could pay elsewhere. He told me he used an online resource to price the cards (I assumed TCG High). After talking to him further he considered coming down to $200, so I told him no thanks. I don't buy cards from that store anymore."
magicTCG,"Well then I would say that describing you as ignorant (with regards to this subject) is not an unfair characterization of your knowledge.   Let's clear up a few things for you. While it's possible that scry will be in an upcoming set, it's extremely unlikely seeing as scry was a mechanic in Theros, a set so recent it's still in standard, and they generally don't like to reuse mechanics without a large period of time between them. To give you an idea of how soon we can expect scry again in a standard legal set, scry, which has appeared more than just about any other non-evergreen mechanic, most recently appeared in THS and M11.   Additionally, the absence of serum visions was expected in THS because serum visions has a plane specific name (serum being specific to mirrodin). Seeing as we're not going back to New Phyrexia / Mirrodin for some time (we were just there a few years ago), reprinting serum vision seems very unlikely.   Additionally part deux, WOTC has made it a point not to print "good cantrips" in recent standard legal sets. You have to go back several years to find the last good 1cc cantrip spell that WOTC made.   So, in conclusion, we're not likely to see Serum Visions reprinted in a standard legal set anytime soon because: (1) the scry mechanic isn't coming back anytime soon, (2) we're not going back to Mirrodin / New Phyrexia any time soon, and (3) serum vision is "too good" for standard legal sets these days.     HOWEVER, for two months this summer WOTC will have FNM promos of "modern staples." The first month is Path to Exile. This is important because Path is NOT in MM2, which suggests that the second FNM promo will also not be in MM2. The obvious options for the FNM promo include serum visions (and some other cards like Aven Mindscensor) due to its high price and frequent use in modern.   So, while we shouldn't expect serum visions in a standard legal set anytime soon, its exclusion from MM2 would make perfect sense if they were planning on using it as the second "modern" FNM."

snowboarding,"I actually was at ski dazzle yesterday and everything looked like just below retail price as far as gear until I found a booth that sold me [this board]( , Avalanche boots and bindings for $250 flat with no sales tax since I paid in cash.  If it wasn't for that deal, I would have said it was a waste of a trip. I was just a novice snowboarder looking to score my own gear after borrowing for years."
AppalachianTrail,"OP - while it's important to worry about your gear, it's even more important to worry about your financial situation. If you do not have  at LEAST  3k in the bank with all your gear bought, I would consider deferring this hike.   Long-distance hiking can be expensive for the first-timer, as you're going to find some of the gear you have doesn't work, too heavy etc and need to be replaced. In addition you'll be taking days off, eating/drinking more than you would at home. Most first time hikers (and some hikers in general) spend a lot of their time partying in town - which can get expensive.  So if you're not financially prepared (not just for the hike, but coming back from it as well) I would push it another year. That's just me."
Alabama,"Here's what she has to say, hope you find it illuminating:   BitterOldPunk thinks that my perspective, as a lefty Canadian who's been living in Birmingham for the last couple of years, might be helpful, so I've been thinking about what to say about Alabama. The more I think about it, the more nebulous it all gets. The thing is, like anywhere else in the world, Alabama is varied and layered and filled with so many differences -- regional, cultural, individual -- that it's impossible to sum up in a few sentences. (That makes it sound like some kind of dessert confection, which is appropriate, since AL is indeed filled with delicious food that will probably kill you. These folks take their food seriously.) All that follows is with the caveat that I haven't spent much time in rural AL, though I have seen some of it, and so can't really talk about what people are like there, except that the ones I've met have all been warm and friendly and helpful.   Is there racism here? Sure. But the 60s and 70s are far behind us, and frankly, I've seen worse racism and similar income disparity between whites and natives in Canada. In urban areas, I'd say the Canadian income disparity is worse. The people I've met here, both black and white, are honest about the racist history of Alabama and are not shy about calling racism out when they see it. The Birmingham Civil Rights Institute is a monument to this approach. (Link:  Maybe I've been lucky in the friends I've made; everyone's different. Is the Civil War still an issue? Sure, for some. In my experience, it's brought up a lot more by non-Southerners (including some of my Canadian friends), usually in the form of pointing at the South and saying, "They just won't let go," thus perpetuating the stereotype. Is it Jesus country? Oh, hell yes. You will come across dry counties and areas where no liquor is served on Sundays; Christianity comes up a lot both in the media and in private conversations; and there are more churches here than I've seen anywhere. It's irritating for me, coming from a much more secular society, when Christianity governs so much of public life. That said, the Christians I've met have not been pushy about it, and haven't treated me differently for being a 3rd generation agnostic, and though I know a couple still hope that I'll be saved, that's just because they like me. Is it conservative? Yes. Way more so than I'm comfortable with. I try to avoid talking politics here, because I start to froth at the mouth. However, not everyone is conservative, just more people than I'm used to, and some people I didn't expect to be.   Where Canadians are polite, the Southerners I've met have been warm. Friendly. Even more polite. In my experience, Southerners take two things seriously -- food and football -- and as for the rest, if it's good, enjoy it; if it's bad, laugh about it, and then do something about it. And then tell stories about it, preferably funny ones. Because there are some seriously funny people walking around here. Things move more slowly here, too. Don't expect to go through a check-out without a conversation. In fact, don't expect to do anything that involves interacting with another human being without there being some conversation. Don't expect things to be done right freaking now, because that's just not how things are done here.   This has turned into a big"
Alabama,"I am originally from south Florida, but most people I encounter in Alabama consider me a Northerner. I don't understand that. Having moved here about 4 years ago, there are many good and bad things about the state.   The biggest negative to me is in the extreme influence of Christianity on everything. People assume you are a Christian and get offended when you are not. I do agree with VyseofArcadia that it is difficult to get a job/promotion unless you know someone, and specifically if you know them from church. I work at a university, and even here where people seem more liberal than the surrounding areas, I rarely see anyone hired that doesn't know someone else through church. Thankfully, my mother-in-law works here, so I was able to get a job. I also agree with his/her statement that people tend to pray for things that action would be more appropriate. The recent tornadoes have devastated many communities in my area, and people with pray for the families and what not, but rarely do they actually do anything.   There are many racist people here. I here people talk badly about interracial couples. But, to be fair, I lived in Brooklyn before moving here, and people were just as racist up there. Many people here have negative opinions about people from the North, which includes me. They think my voice is very snobby sounding simply because I do not have the Southern accent.   The stereotype of southern hospitality is somewhat true. People will talk to you, wave at you, and generally are nice to you even if they do not know you. But, they will also talk badly about you behind your back, and then just say "bless his/her heart" like that erases all the horrible stuff they just said.   They do love BBQ and Mexican food here, but hate Mexicans (this included all Hispanic/Spanish people, even if they are not actually Mexican at all). Guns are a very big deal to many people, but they do seem to hunt here often, so I can understand it.   From what I have seen, people are severely undereducated compared to where I have lived before this. They do not seem to have a firm grasp on the English language or know any basic facts about history and science. Like I said previously, I work at a university, and you would think the students would know these things, but that is very untrue. I am constantly surprised at how many of my students speak and write.   They seem to listen to pop music here, just like anywhere else in America. I haven't noticed really any significant difference in music tastes, other than love of country music, which I think is getting more and more popular in America as a whole.   The best thing about Alabama, to me, is the pace of life and the cost of everything. People are significantly less rushed and all the food and housing is so much cheaper. You wage will be lower, but I feel like I can buy more now than I ever could. Property taxes are ridiculously low, but this has an impact on our schools.   My biggest annoyance with Alabama (other than the religion thing) is how people present themselves in public. I am not saying you have to look super nice everywhere you go, but people where pajama pants out to the store (and by the store, I mean Walmart, because that is all you are getting in most places.) You'll see dirty little children with just diapers on running around stores. People walk around without shoes or shirts on or just look generally dirty. I understand that when you have a manual labor job, you get dirty and need to go to the store, but I am not talking about people like that. I know this sounds snooty, but it really bothers me.   Also, people are very hypocritical. They will talk badly about someone doing something, but then do the same thing. For example, with the recent tornadoes, FEMA has been giving out food stamps to most people that apply, even if you had no damage. A woman that I see at work asked me if I had gotten them, and I said that I hadn't because I had only lost power for 12 hours and had no damage to my home. She told me I can get them anyhow, it doesn't matter if I actually need them. This is a person who had previously discussed with me how she thinks people that abuse welfare/disability are just awful people."
cordcutters,"So, essentially, it breaks down like this.  [I might get some flack from folks in this sub, but...it's all kind of true, as the point is to be frugal, not deprive yourself.   I used to watch The Walking Dead the nights it came out.  It is still to this day, my favorite show.  I haven't watched any of the current season other than the first episode (it was free on AMC online for a month or so.)   Now...I have Netflix and watch it the year after it came out.  I still get all the tantalizing indulgence of watching the epic show...and I don't really care about what time of my life I watched it in.  I just know I want to see it.  I have learned to be patient at this.   As a cord cutter, you are faced with this particular dilemma on a very regular basis, among other things.   Cons to being a cord cutter:     You won't watch your shows as regular as you would if you had cable.  Amass patience in abundance, or spend the money.     You won't watch commercials as regular as you would if you had cable.  (This is a con because there are actually products in the world you found out about through commercials...take nintendo for example.)     You will not find out about upcoming shows until they've been out for awhile.  (Not that bad, but refer to #1 for why this is a con.)     You won't be able to watch all of the sports that you were used to when you want, unless you spend the money.     Several other situations arise, but it's all about what you want.       I cut the cord about 3 or 4 years ago.  Before that, I never had internet at the house (had it at work, so no real need) and paid for cable or satellite TV.  Now I pay about $35 for hi-speed internet and xfinity ondemand, and $7 for netflix.  I rent movies from the local Family Video and RedBox quite regularly, and because I'm saving about $120/month, me and my SO go out to the movies quite frequently.  Instead of watching TV shows all the time, we usually watch something online.  Netflix has something of interest that will last you for long periods of time.  It took us about 3 months to watch the entire series of House...and that was watching it every time we sat down to watch a show, nothing but movies otherwise.  We found we have a lot more free time, and I have all but given up caring about professional sports.   The long and short of it is this, you as a consumer have to breakdown your budget for entertainment, and then you have analyze that with what you want to be entertained with.  If you are going to just cut the cord for the sake of doing so, but still want to watch all of your shows as quickly as possible, you might as well NOT cut the cord...because the costs will add up to almost the same, and I would rather have cable than not if the price is close enough.  Right now, I pay a little over $60/month for home entertainment, and have extra money for outdoor entertainment (movies, concerts, sporting events, etc...)  I think the internet is far more superior to cable though, so in my opinion, it wins out over the cost of cable anyways...simply because I have found other things to entertain myself with.  Especially Reddit...fuck I'm on here way too long...I mean seriously, look at what I just typed for this!"
cordcutters,"I'll probably be down-voted for appearing to support ISPs, but here's how it actually works. . .   Firstly, Netflix doesn't offer free appliances. Netflix provides a guide of hardware needed, then tells the ISP to buy that hardware, install it in their system, pay for electricity and maintenance, and Netflix will populate it with their content.   Secondly, the burden is on the enduser's ISP because Netflix has been paying for cheap content hosting, pushing lots of content down through Cogent or whatever other content provider, and not receiving anything on the up-side.   Currently, the internet has a sort of peering agreement where if I'm downloading 1Gb from your server, then I expect you to receive about 1Gb on your end. That makes it fair on both ends for sharing bandwidth and transportation of data. As /u/griz120 said, Netflix's ~35% of bandwidth all is being shoved down the pipes of the ISPs, but then they're not doing anything to be fair and receive near that same amount. ISPs wanted a way to share the load since Netflix wasn't being fair in peering, so they suggested that Netflix should pay for their bandwidth instead of receiving bandwidth up. And here we are today.   I don't support either end. But you have to understand, Netflix isn't some magical company that cares only about the consumers. They're focused firstly on their investors and their bottom line, just as the ISPs are."
programming,"One more thing, that few people fail to realize, is that success is often extremely random. Maybe if you're lucky your project will get recognized and get into a positive feedback loop of adaptation and recognition. Sensitive dependence on initial conditions.   But probably not. If you want to be successful with any kind of creative venture, you've got to be willing to do  a lot  of work that no one will ever see or recognize. Maybe if you're lucky you will hit on something that catches on. But the only thing you can do is keep rolling those dice and try not to be deterred by your failures."
programming,"No one says you didn't work hard, just that hard work is not sufficient, you need luck( those opportunities you seized) as well.   Being lucky isn't about things falling into your lap, that kind of luck only really happens to folks who are already connected. It's about the right guy looking for the right thing at the right time or your unsolicited email not getting trashed because the recipient was feeling generous that morning."
programming,"First off, quick minor rant: a lot of the article hinges on whether or not they broke the conditions of the bug bounty program. The author doesn't seem to respect the reader's time enough to link to the description of the bug bounty? I guess it's [this one](   That aside, on to more substantive issues. The author says, "Wait, what condition did I break?" Maybe one of these?   > Only test services which are in scope!  > Never ever try to access somebody else鈥檚 account or prezis, please always use your own account(s) for testing!   So he accessed someone else's account on a service that is not in scope.   And their email makes this abundantly clear:   > by using the credentials to log in you violated the terms and conditions of our bounty program   His argument is that he didn't log in  as a prezi user :   > I was not testing prezi accounts themselves   Arguably, the conditions sound like they are kinda intended to cover prezi user accounts, not other user accounts, but arguably not. It's vague on that point. It doesn't specifically limit to prezi accounts. They also specifically state that other services are not in scope. What would be the most reasonable interpretation given that? If they don't want you testing things that are out of scope, and they don't want you logging in to accounts which are in scope, does that mean it's OK if you login to accounts that are out of scope? You were presumed not to be testing them anyway.   It might not technically forbidden (or it might be, depending on hair splitting interpretation), but he's arguing solely on a technicality.   And then he has the tact to be outraged and critique them for the style of writing they use in their emails:   > When replying to bugs, please refrain from any comments and be sure to keep it professional.  > Keep a consistent tone. When replying to my initial findings, the tone was positive. In the follow-up email, the tone sounded almost as if it was negative and unwarranted.   Basically, what the fuck. All of Prezi's emails were perfectly professional. They made a totally justified judgment call but were polite enough to be apologetic about it. And this guy is acting like a total condescending asshole toward them.   Then he says:   > What do you mean by a prezi account?   But THEY NEVER USE THE WORDS "prezi account". So they don't mean anything by it because it is not something they ever said. They said "somebody else's account or prezis", not "somebody else's prezi account". He is putting words in their mouth, and then trying to call them out on what those words mean. This in the same letter where he accuses  them  of being unprofessional.   While I'm on the subject, he also says:   > But just realising that it was a Maven repository which contained prezi source code   Maven repositories do not normally contain source code! They are used for storing the output of builds, i.e. binaries. It is possible to store source jars in them, but not every site does that. But he could not have verified that this particular Maven repository does contain source code because:   > Personally, I do not know the severity of what I found in the sense of the files present as all I simply did was log in to confirm the credentials worked   So his whole entire claim, that he found source code, is totally unproven. Or, he is lying about what he did with those credentials."
programming,"I can't speak for all programs, but mine was filled with stereotypical poorly socialized and insecure males.  There was an amazing amount of dick swinging and fighting to become the alpha dog among what was, essentially, a pack of losers.  (I.e., we were used to being the bottom rung of the social ladder and, in this new environment, we instinctively fought desperately to avoid being in the same situation in our new environment.)  Unfortunately, it's easy to accidentally say hurtful things when you are poorly socialized.  Worse, it's rare to see people who are even trying to be considerate.   Around third year, things started to get better.  It was around that time that most of the chaff had dropped out and the serious students were spending a lot of time crunching on projects.  People also started learning who was how skilled; it was much easier when the class size shrunk from 200 to 40 and more evenings were spent in the labs.  Because of the lower numbers (and the wistful loneliness), women tended to have much higher visibility.   In 4th year, there were 4 women in a class of 40.  2 of them were very strong (I think one has her doctorate now) and the other 2 were adequate.  This compared very favorably to the men, who were closer to the expected 10/70/20 split.   In the work force, I think all 4 of the women would have done very well.  Sadly, so would have most all of the men, but that's more the result of the state of the industry.   For what it's worth, skills, a thick skin, and self-awareness will go a long way in a lot of interesting industries that pay well."
programming,"When I was 10 years old I was studying calculus from a textbooks I found someone dropped off near the recycling bin. I DID have problems integrating the area under the curve because I thought I should be able to do this without graphing it every time. So it was not my intelligence that gave me problems, it was my ego, my pride. I thought calculus should be easier than it was."
programming,"Often that's true, but not all game programming is like that. I work 45 hour weeks, no crunch times, making good money, and our company has almost no turnover whatsoever. The problem is the programmers that decide to work for large studios that are known for fucking over their developers. If they stopped taking those jobs then those companies would be forced to change the way they pay and treat their employees."
programming,"The idea behind patterns is that there's certain ways of thinking and acting that we humans fall into. These things happen even in completely different problems. So we can find management patters in a team of 5, or a company of 10,000 and this is without even discussing what these groups want to do.   The patterns started with programming, but have slowly been creeping to other areas. In theory you could see them anywhere people have to think about how to do something.   Patterns where originally pushed as positive, things you want to do. The idea is that you could realize that a pattern applied to your situation and then you could use the collective wisdom from everyone who's used that pattern even if no one has ever dealt with your problem. But then some of these patterns where found to be bad ideas in general, they sound good, or seem attractive, but in reality leave you worse off than if you hadn't followed them at all. This began getting called anti-patterns.   An interesting thing is the following anti-pattern: putting the pattern before the horse. This is, patterns are not a magical solution, they appear in certain cases (and should appear naturally). The idea is that you should recognize patterns and anti-patterns within what you are doing and act accordingly (improving implementation and avoiding common mistakes, or trying to avoid the anti-pattern). Some people force the patterns, assuming that the more you add the better. I would say patterns are like salt, if you add what's needed towards the end you get something really good, if you add as much as you can at the beginning you'll finish with something inedible.   So in short ("
programming,"So, these numbers (or my math!) might be totally off, but based on  wikipedia  are in technology.   So, hypothetically, if (big if) my numbers are right, and if (another big if) I've got these numbers right, then even if everyone at google+amazon was a rockstar, that would still only be .08% of the total labor force.  That seems plausible.   So, I'm not saying everyone at google/amazon IS a rockstar.  But I AM saying that your argument, "tons of people work at those companies, they can't ALL be rockstars, there are just too many" is not a good argument, as far as I can tell."
programming,"Look, although 156  million people in the us are working, they aren't all working in software.  The majority of amazon and google employees are software engineers or other IT, unless you want to talk about distribution centers at amazon which makes the argument even worse.   So, I made up a number of 50,000 employees for amazon/google, and I don't know how many people work as software engineers and other IT in the USA, but it's not  57.7 million, so I'm not sure what "technology work" is.  I used to work at microsoft (three times, once as an employee, twice afterwards as a contractor), and have worked with many amazon and google employees, and have worked with lots of other software engineers in Seattle in small companies and even at a bank.  I have worked in software for 18 years.   The arrogance that amazon and google and microsoft employees have because they work for this "prestigious" software company is nonsense arrogance.  They are not smarter or better than a good developer at any other company, and they are certainly not all good developers.  In fact, in many cases they are just run of the mill developers who tend to be ok in a big hive mind mentality, albeit the hive mind mentalities of google, amazon and microsoft are all very very different.  I'd personally rather work at google than amazon and amazon than microsoft but I'm not interested in working for any of them.  It's subjective, but I honestly do not think that just because you got hired at google means you're a "rockstar".   It means you're a software engineer at a huge corporate company that hires specific types of developers.  Every company interviews differently, and although google compensates well, it's not a ridiculous salary.  It's just a big software company."
programming,"When we have million core CPUs, I'm sure someone will figure out how to exploit them.     The whole discussion is about exactly  how  we're going to do that. If they're not going to be useful, no one will bother designing them.   CPUs are nothing like brains. Neural networks are excellent at certain specialised applications (particularly classification and machine learning), but they would be a very poor fit for a deterministic processor.   The underlying issue is one of engineering: how do you get that 1M core CPU, and what compromises do you have to make? If you spread the cores among multiple chips, IPC and locking overheads increase by several orders of magnitude. If you make the cores simpler, you lose out compared to giving a single core extra cache (according to Linus).   Another interesting design issue is what granularity of parallelism you use - consider the difference between a distributed cluster, a multicore CPU, and an FPGA. The FPGA is probably the closest to the brain in terms of granularity, since it handles parallelism on the level of individual gates (which are similar to neurons in complexity). Finer granularity means less overhead for IPC, more complex scheduling, and more expensive context switches."
programming,"It depends on whether the DB is a "first-class citizen" in how the application works, which will vary depending on the organization. If you actually have "real DBA" who can write, test, debug, and profile all that stuff, and feature-negotiation regularly happens between the database and application-layer teams... then it's probably OK, because at that point the DB is itself one of your "battle-tested tools for logic".   Conversely, if you don't need/want to go in that direction, it's better to treat the DB as a data-store that happens to have too-cool-not-to-use query-functionality and integrity assertions. If the database-behavior is too complex to mock in your tests, that's a warning flag."

programming,"I'm going to both agree with you, but also respectfully disagree.   On the one hand, the basic self discipline that includes YAGNI and straightforwardness is both the most important and the hardest part. Expert musicians practice scales and athletes run sprints because doing the basics right is the foundation.   On the other hand, I'm certain it's not the  only  thing. Even the history of programming languages and operating systems show that it is not. Human readable assembly is easier to maintain than machine code. Structured languages are easier than assembly. Objects, pure functions, and garbage collection add even more advantages. Operating systems with memory isolation and preemptive multitasking are less bug prone than those without.   The two big themes are readability and modularity. It's great when we figure out how to build those into the systems themselves, but surely there is a range of choices we can make in the systems we have today that have different pros and cons to balance. Design is about tradeoffs, I'd like to know more about what ones are available.   Edit:"
programming,"premature optimization..   I'm actually talking more about premature abstraction. In my industry (games) it's hard to think too much about performance, and honestly given how long most stuff takes in a lot of programs... I wish that other areas of software took performance as seriously too, as I think there's a degree of anti-optimization in programming culture.   > Fair enough, but excessively large functions are hard to understand   Not sure this is actually true. It certainly can be, but I've seen 10kloc+ functions that were understandable, well written code (these were main loops in games). This is excessive, admittedly, but if a function is doing something extremely complex, you should . I'd say around 100-500 lines you should look to break up a complex function, and even then, only do so if it would really clear the code up. A 1000 line function in one place is  far  easier to change than if you split that up into many parts among several files. See the [First Link]( I had above for a discussion about this.   > Abstraction layers centralize the detailed manipulations and make the next layer simpler, but they can leak and make unexpected behavior much harder to diagnose.   I'd say that if you're worried about abstraction leakage, you've gone too far. In my experience, the abstraction should perform the detailed manipulation for you, not hide what the manipulation is.   > Edit:"

Nothing of what you said gave any value to using eval().

Nothing of that gives any reason to use eval().  Indeed, it's extremely difficult to find a legitimate reason to use eval(); literally every time I've seen someone try, they just expose their ignorance of PHP, and there's nearly always a much easier and far safer way to do things.   Listen.   There is no fucking good reason for using eval() PHP, unless you're actually trying to execute code, at which point you need to be on terror alert red.   Come up with a concrete counterexample, or don't waste your time telling me I'm wrong, because I won't be listening.   Way too many times I've seen novice PHP developers say "this is an internal tool, it won't matter" and their tool has ended up causing a security nightmare.   There's an  enormous  difference between "I don't see an upcoming problem" and "this is safe".  Much of being a mature programmer is accepting that difference and not using techniques that could lead to problems, even if you can't imagine what those problems are going to be.   So go ahead, show me something that makes eval() a good idea, which isn't easily replaced by a more responsible method.   And don't waste my time trying to invent a cultural sandbox again, because as I keep trying to explain to you, I DO NOT AGREE THAT IT'S OKAY TO USE UNSAFE METHODS WHEN SAFE METHODS EXIST.   > This isn't about completion of the project, it's about completion of the task.

Just because you don't understand the analogy doesn't mean it isn't there.  It's actually quite simple.  You probably shouldn't have edited away the context that'd help you understand.   You said "You don't have to implement security against malicious attacks by yourself."   Uh huh.  And who does security against malicious attacks in the physical world?  The police.   We implement security because we don't know where it's coming from.  Acting like it can only come from internals is a nonsense behavior (one which I was clear with you was rejected, but you seem intent on riding this sinking ship to the bottom.)

programming,"This report's a disaster. I've found and reported critical security bugs in all the browsers on the list, so I'll limit my criticism to those. Here goes.   Apple Safari and Google Chrome are getting  unfairly punished for being more transparent , and Mozilla lumps any internally discovered memory corruption (as in remote code execution) under a single CVE for each release.   I'm also dubious of the quality of these ratings. Many of the Chrome bug reports are restricted and I can't read them, but of the ones I can all seem to be mis-scored. All the Chrome WebKit vulnerabilities I've been able to look at are listed as full compromises of integrity and confidentiality. However, the Chrome sandbox would mitigate those to partial at the most under the CVSS scoring guidelines. So, based on my read, the vast majority of the Chrome bugs should be ranked below the 7-10 threshold described in the report.   One other thing is odd. You'll notice that most of the vendor's CVEs are clustered in groups. This is because any decent sized software project or company will generally get a block of CVEs allocated to them, so they can do the vulnerability reporting themselves to ensure it's correct. Chrome's CVEs are all over the place and the rankings diverge wildly (WebKit is clustered, however). I'm guessing that Google doesn't participate in CVE reporting, and all these entries are coming from third parties, which explains the disproportionately large number of errors. Google really should get off their asses and start doing this themselves, otherwise they look like idiots."

autism,"I don't know about that. There are tons of high functioning autistic people in my area (I live in an academic/artist/musician neighbourhood, lots of high functioning physicists, biochemists, musicians, artists, hackers, genuises around these parts, so common here that it's considered abnormal to be neurotypical).   If I have children I'm definitely going to make sure they're surrounded by artists and academia, it seems to be the most openminded community setting and because being kind of weird is socially acceptable here it enables us to function effectively.   I have issues with my circadian rhythm. Hormones. I'm way too sensitive. When I worked in the corporate world it was torture for me, the fluorescent lights, the smell of office chemicals, the almost robot-like (my apologies) stupidity of my coworkers, being looked down on even though I was one of the best workers in the office but I'm a bit weird. I hated it. I've lived in my current hood for almost 15 yrs now. I work for artists, film makers, in biotech, and hang out with likeminded people. They don't mind if I come in late, or stay up all night, if I say weird things, if I have opinions they don't quite understand, I don't have to wear restrictive suits or pantyhose anymore, I don't have to act or look normal, all I have to do is be myself, and be kind to people.   Like.. there's a guy, brilliant mathematician, total weirdo, high functioning autistic, who walks around in the dead of winter (-20C! damn cold) in socks and sandals, big winter coat, and a beard down to his belly. He is completely accepted by everyone in the community. I think he's hilarious. Doesn't like to talk to people but is a nice guy if you actually know him. He has a cute nickname I won't post here (sorry, just in case).   Anyway. If you are lucky enough to find your way in life, find a group of people who love and accept you for who you are, who enable you to live a full, happy life, who don't require you to "adapt" to a "normal" lifestyle, then you can thrive.   When I was a kid no one thought I'd make it. I was discouraged from going to college or university. I was told I wasn't  capable  of living a full, happy, productive life. I was constantly held back and put down. I wasn't even allowed to go to high school until they were sure I'd "fit in" (jerks!). I was a foster child so I had to deal with all that too.   I didn't listen to them. I moved out when I was 17. I got a job. I learned that as long as I was perfectly behaved at work I would be promoted and well compensated. I had temper tantrums the minute I walked in the door at home, but at work quiet as a mouse, I avoided conflict (to my own detriment).   In my early 20's I decided to try college. It was boring. The material was elementary. I switched from general studies to a history major to an urban planning major to a software development major (where I'm at now, really only in SD so I can pass the prereqs to qualify for a biophysics major). I'm at one of the most respected universities in the world. I have a lot of friends. I have a great resume with great references. I'm a total weirdo but somehow it works because I'm kind. And smart. And funny. Not to sound arrogant but to show... that self-love, self-respect is very important. And that it's possible to excel, to thrive, to be accepted, if you find the right community.   The only thing I needed to "adapt" about myself were the temper tantrums. That freaked people out, freaked friends and family out. It took 10 yrs to reprogram myself. Meditation is what did it for me. Breathing exercises. No medication (my body doesn't like meds). A bit of therapy that didn't help and only exacerbated the issue.   It's possible. If you're med or high functioning there is a lot of hope. For low functioning autistic people it's more complicated. But there's still a lot of hope. There's always hope."
vegas,"I did a write up on my favorite beer places here in Vegas. It's on my work computer though (I know, tough job). I'll post it tomorrow if I can find it. Is there a time limit you're here for? A quick stalk of your username makes me think you are in Connecticut. I want to give you beer places but if you can't wait till tomorrow for the full write-up:   Big Dog's Draft House   Ellis Island Casino and Brewery  (cheap beer, but GOOD cheap beer)   The Public House  (In the Venetian. Don't get me started on the one in the Luxor.)   Aces and Ales   Todd English's P.U.B.  in Crystals Mall at the City Center (it touches the Aria)<---Note: Can you chug a beer in under 7 seconds? They'll let you have 1 pint free if you can. As I understand it, that applies to any beer you want, so have at it. Pro Tip: The beer can't leave the counter until the timer starts, but that doesn't mean your lips can't be hovering a millimeter over that sucker right before they let you start.   Freakin' Frog . I saw someone say service sucked/overpriced/Yard House has "more" beers. For me: Service has always been above excellent, especially on slower nights in the middle of the week when you can talk beer with the bartenders/no more overpriced then anywhere else on or near the strip/Yard House has more DRAFT beers. Freakin' Frog is home to 1,000 beers and has a literal Beer Bible (binder) for you to choose from. Ask them to let you check out their fridge, it's beautiful. If you like Whiskey at all, it is also home to the largest selection of Whiskey in North America upstairs and the owner (a professor at UNLV) gives a class on a tasting technique that is amazing. I'm not kidding. I don't like whiskey and this guy's technique made me like it. His class is like $70, but is great for groups and you get at least 7 shots (more if you ask nicely) of high quality whiskey so it kind of evens out. Go to the class sober, leave drunk.   I didn't mean to promote Freakin' Frog over any other place, I just thought it was weird people were so down on it. The  only  bad thing I can say about it is that it's a little divey. That's it. If you can handle divey go check it out. My personal favorite is the Public House in the Venetian. Call ahead and ask if Russell is around. He's the only certified Beer [Cicerone]( in Nevada and he is a great human being who truly loves beer. He's working on his Master Cicerone now and might already have it since the last time I talked to him was a couple of months ago. The food at The Public House is great too, but like the rest of The Strip it definitely gets pricey.   Some of those places are pricey, some not, but you said you wanted a good selection and I think these places are a little more unique then The Yard House. Yard House is great (I don't argue with anywhere that has 150 beers on tap), but you can find it in places other then Vegas.   By the way, this wasn't my write up, but I love beer and got a little carried away. I'll send you the rest if I can find it.   EDIT:"
vegas,"Story time: I grew up in northern Ohio and it was commonplace to drink water from the tap. It was as natural as Saturday morning cartoons, you just did it without thinking. Once I made it to Vegas, I quickly realized that tap water was no longer an option because, at least to me, the smell I get when trying to drink a glass full of tap water here makes me pause and look for the turd floating in my glass.   Fast forward to this past weekend. My husband has a 17 year old brother who, save one class trip in Kindergarten, has never traveled outside of Vegas (their family does well enough, but not enough to take 4 kids on elaborate vacations out of state). We took him with us to our recent trip to an amusement park in SoCal. Once we got settled into the hotel room, I was thirsty so I grabbed a glass and filled it from the faucet in the bathroom. As I walked into the main part of the hotel room drinking the water, my bro-in-law looked at me honestly astonished at what I was doing. I had to explain to him that, yes, in other parts of the country it is common to be able to drink the water straight from the faucet. He was still visibly surprised and grabbed the glass from my hand to taste it for himself."

Harbour Island, just off the north end of Eleuthera is really nice and Dean's Blue Hole on Long Island is something worth seeing and swimming over top of.  If you go to Long Island visit Max's Conch Stand...great guy, guy conch salad/food.   Surfer's Beach, Eleuthera is really nice too - not the greatest for swimming but having the Atlantic waves crash down onto an amazing beach is worth experiencing."
travel,"Ok here we go, its gonna be long, but I'm gonna try to keep the technical to a minimum and tell you why all of these specs don't matter.   To start off we aren't talking about cdma, only GSM. Some phones can do both, but it doesn't matter because CDMA is "rare".  This rarity will be a constant issue, because there are so many phones and so many carriers that there will always be an endless combination of one-off exceptions and such. These are mostly irrelevant though as there are so many choices for carriers, your phone should never have an issue. Every phone won't be perfect for every carrier,  but every phone will have plenty of options available and work with nearly every carrier in the world, thats the gsm standard. (Again gsm not cdma)   Now onto gsm phones.  Pretty much every single phone has the same radio technology in it. They can connect to a ton of different GSM bands, Any phone in the last few years can connect to any gsm network and do very very well. The networks themselves have various bands they operate on, but your phone can connect to so many different bands, it will connect to whatever it needs to. This is one of the whole points of how GSM operates. It's a standard but has local flexibility.  Your phone can access and use so many bands, that no matter what carrier you are working with you can access all of their stuff. One of the big reasons even more than all of this why you can access so many bands, is that it is easy to do for the chip maker and they are forward thinking, even if you use only a tiny portion of the capabilities, instead of making a dozen separate chips, they can just put it all on one chip and also future-proof it and make it so they can just supply a single chip for phones and the carrier's specific bands don't because the single chip can deal with all of them. Of course random and rare exceptions apply, chip makers sometimes adjust for this, when a certain carrier has an odd band or new implementation of a thing, often the chip makers can adjust to make it work for these rare exceptions, especially if its a big carrier. But incredibly overwhelmingly, a gsm chip will work effectively under nearly any circumstance.  In addition to all of this, the chips generally are far more advanced than the networks they connect to.  It's easy to add features and stuff to a chip that a network could use if they wanted, but these features are often incredibly hard to implement by the carrier, so chip makers throw tons of stuff on these, just in case some random network ever wants to activate some specific feature.   So this gets to a point.  All the gsm phones are basically the same from the radio perspective, your phone will connect to whatever it needs to--this is the GSM standard.  But what about all of these strange awkward one-off bands? Well for the most part your phone can still use them or just as importantly, it may not need to use them because plenty is available on other bands.  Carrier use a bunch of bands, for a lot of reasons, this really doesn't matter for the end-user, because your phone and the cell tower is smart enough to figure out where it needs to put its bandwidth for optimization, in fact you cannot even change the band or tell your phone how to connect really, so that you can't do it and it lets the computers figure out the optimal path.   Now you've probably seen a ton of ads talking about random phone features, using different bands and such. This is all fluff for marking and for tech people.  Since pretty much every phone is the exact same from a technical perspective, most commonly this is just used as a marketing item to differentiate their phone in the marketplace, and like in most electronics marketing (TV, phones, stereo equipment), specs are just kinda thrown in there to be used as a differentiator.  They know it doesn't matter and that you'll probably never now it or use the features, but they are smart at convincing consumers that the perceived value is higher because they have these fancy specs.  In fact the phone isn't actually doing anything different than another phone. Often they specifically advertise their phones as these "one-off" devices that have something special for a certain carrier. This rarely has a technical impact on the service, its a combined marketing campaign between the carriers and the phone manufacturers. It's a proven strategy in electronics marketing. Essentially confusing your consumers with technical specifications that they think makes the phone more valuable, but really has little value added. TV makers are the absolute best at this imo, they literally just make up specifications and tests and report the values to the consumer in the tech specs, but the "tests" are also decided by them so they can make it whatever score they want.   Back to the original question: Which phone is better? None of them.  They all do the same thing and do whatever they need to do. Pretty much every carrier is the same, and the phone can connect to all of them, and even most of the obscure bands and network, because thats how they build the chips, they can access pretty much everything. As long as your phone is not carrier locked, it will be good on nearly any gsm carrier in the world and be able to access all of its options as needed. The specs don't matter, they are all the same and it has sufficient specs to do whatever it needs to do.   The real difference in phones is the personal preference factor, they are the same from a radio perspective so in order to hit different consumers, they have different phone of course! Choose the phone you like, the insides of all of them are pretty much the same."

Another advantage of going this cheap is that even if the backpack ends up breaking (again, not likely on the first trip), you'll be in a better position to understand what you do and don't like about it.   Oh and don't forget a raincover if they aren't built in."
KitchenConfidential,"It's probably important to ask why 2 people would want to quit at a time that maximizes screwing over their employer. Clearly there is something wrong that needs to be addressed or you'll just end up with more people quitting in such a manner.   I remember one of my first dish jobs was at a busy mid-range restaurant with 3 floors and only 2 dishwashers on duty. One of them was named "Crazy Kevin" because he was a 40 something year old who was legitimately insane, in fact so insane it was mandated that one weekend a month he had to go on "vacation" for mental evaluation (sometimes he wouldn't come back for weeks). My first night there I get trained by Kevin, I'm freshly turned 14 mind you and this is my second dish job (this is a much bigger restaurant). So we're slammed and Kevin can't train anyone, he's insane and even worse.. slow. Buckets of silverware, dishes everywhere and he's spending 20 minutes scrubbing one pan while we get screamed at, I want a cigarette so bad. Service ends around 11 pm and it takes until 1 to finish the dishes. Oh but we're not done yet! Time to mop, the kitchen is pretty huge so even on a great night it takes about 30 minutes to sweep and mop. Kevin is "showing me what to do" and drags out a raggedy garden hose which he attaches to the back sink. He uses it the wet the floor (we have multiple mop buckets) it leaks all over and he takes forever to finish his sections. It's round 2 and he's done but he's stretched out the hose and he's trying to squeeze the water out of it. About 30 minutes later he realizes it's still attached to the sink and there is a slight amount of water going through it. Finally it's about 3 am and his stupid hose is away and we're done. The next night I work with my friend on dish and he's like "never, ever listen to Kevin, he's a retard" and he tells me about Kevin. That night we jammed the fuck out and got out before midnight."
aquaponics,"Realistically you shouldnt have added that many fish at once. What happens when they are ready to harvest? Your cycle will swing uncontrollably. Ideally you want to keep you bioload constant or as nearly constant as possible.  Up the fish load like every 2 weeks and then skip a month. That way your beneficial bacteria dont get overwelmed or starved all at once. Also you get a constant source of food instead of one big haul. Another thing some people do is once you have large fish and want to add in fry is to start them in an aquarium until they are larger."
ronpaul,"I've heard the victim-blaming line of bullshit before but just because someone is a victim doesn't mean they are blameless. If you are a victim of assault a reasonable question to ask is "Why did this happen to me?". To willfully  not  ask this question is self-deception of the highest order and that is truly "cruel and unhelpful". The answer may very well be  shit happens  and he's right in stating that >victimization is often a product of two things: bad luck, on the part of the victim, and malicious intent, on the part of the attacker   But if you poke someone in the eye with a stick enough times eventually he's going to take a swing at you.   Lankford also highlights [studies]( that personal problems are the root of a suicide bomber's homicidal intent and that may very well be true but he fails to address the motivation behind suicide attacks. Nobody just wakes up in the morning, decides he's going to kill himself so straps on a bomb vest then throws a dart at a map. To not address the motivation behind the attacks and just dismiss their reasons because they are unpleasant is intellectually dishonest.   The burning question on everyone's mind after 9/11 was "Why?". The [answer]( was given by Osama bin Laden himself, yet many choose to simply ignore it. "Why are we fighting and opposing you? The answer is very simple: Because you attacked us and continue to attack us." He then goes on to list examples of American intervention and highlight America's support for Israel "You attacked us in Somalia; you supported the Russian atrocities against us in Chechnya, the Indian oppression against us in Kashmir, and the Jewish aggression against us in Lebanon", the more than 1.5 million Iraqi children that died as a result of our sanctions and that "Your forces occupy our countries; you spread your military bases throughout them; you corrupt our lands, and you besiege our sanctities, to protect the security of the Jews and to ensure the continuity of your pillage of our treasures". Blowback is the inevitable consequence of our foreign policy and our meddling in the affairs of other countries. That there are negative consequences to our interventionist foreign policy should not come as a surprise to anyone.   We all need to take a good hard look at American foreign policy and until we do the United States will continue down the same path we have been going down the last 50 years: military intervention, trade sanctions, undeclared wars, indiscriminate bombing and the inevitable blowback that comes with such a policy."
ronpaul,"Yep, initially I got in contact with the local Ron Paul enthusiasts. I went to the initial ground game meetup in December and got to know a few of the folks, and learned how to get a list of Republican Super-Voters in the area (super-voters are essentially people who reliably vote, including primary elections).   Rule #1 of Ron Paul Ground Game is  OWN YOUR PRECINCT . Search Facebook for a Ron Paul group in your area; find out how to get a list of super-voters for your precinct. If your group is fairly well organized, there's probably someone with a big stack of Super Brochures waiting for an ambitious Paulite to canvass their area with them. If not, you can always buy them yourself for cheap: [   Once you have the super brochures and a list of super voters, you're good to go. I picked up a few things at Staples to help look semi-professional: clipboard with storage container (to hold bumper stickers and extra brochures) and name tag stickers. When I go out I clean myself up, wear my local football team's polo and jeans, I slap the " Hello My Name is " sticker on and start knocking on doors.   My door routine is pretty straightforward and a matter of personal preference, but you want to keep it brief. If I knock on a door and they answer, I go with "Hi, I'm with the Republican party and we're going around the neighborhood, encouraging everyone to vote for Doctor Ron Paul on or before January 31st.". Sometimes, if the vibe is right, I mention that I'm stopping by because they are a SUPER VOTER! :D   I talk to everyone I see outside, whether they are on my list or not, because they are very approachable. I find that a simple, "any Republicans in the house?" works well for an intro."
FIU,"I just had an exam through ProctorU today. So, while they are non-intrusive, they still watch you. Here a quick rundown: I started my session through chat first, the webcam part came into place for me to show my ID, show my desk and area I was taking the exam, they give you the OK, and put a code for you on Blackboard to start the exam. After that, the webcam in their end is paused and you start your exam and continue like you normally would (on my exam I was able to have PDFs from the class open but no web browsing). At the end I had to contact them through the chat and they will confirm I'm done... And that's it."
collapse,"I have wondered about this for years...what would really happen to the military if everything fell apart. I spent 12+ years as a Cav Scout (19D) in the Army. Deployed twice to Iraq, have been stationed in Germany, Korea, etc. Left as an E-6 after my last tour in Iraq.  To me, it seems to depend on the heart of the soldier, the moral sense of what is right, what type of unit they are in, and the mentality of others in their unit.  There are so many variables. If all hope seemed lost, how many would leave and return to their families? How much and what type of equipment would they have? Depending on how things went down, they might be a long ways from home. I have known many good soldiers, but there are also quite a few that I would never want to cross their path in a lawless world."
collapse,"Well part of this is failing to realize that the old watt-meters are crazy rugged compared to smart-meters.   You can easy overload the old eddy current watt-meters by hundreds to thousands of volts.   These new smart meters primarily operate internally at voltages below 10V with a small portion that passes 120/240V.  They were never designed for overvoltage at the levels in this situation (it was likely a 2 KV line that fell on a 240V line that caused this).  The rest of the grid typically deals with this kind of thing just fine."
collapse,"In the early 80's, [inflation spiked at around 14%]( Death spirals did not ensue.   Inflation comes and goes, ultimately. Fiat money keeps being printed, and everybody plays along.   Now if you're referring to the depletion of natural resources behind some of those price hikes, you've got something to talk about, as it's unlikely new pools of those resources would suddenly materialize. The impact of depletion would be more permanent in nature, and could only be mitigated by adjusting/re-inventing every process that once relied on it. That may not always be possible. If enough of those processes are lost, fundamental assumptions about our society might become broken. That'd be kinda sorta like a form of collapse."
Twitch,"I actually took the opposite approach. Where I am in the communities I am in, it's difficult to near impossible to hide my real name, so I don't try. I've had fans find me on skype and I just generally tell them that I don't add everyone because I use that for business (which is 100% true) and they get the idea, the ones that don't get blocked.   It doesn't help I use the same username almost everywhere to help strengthen the brand, but a quick google search of my screen name, website name, twitch, or basically anything from my community will find me without much effort. I just don't make a big deal out of it and generally people don't seem to either.   In general, the more you try to remain a secret, the more people will look. People always want what they can't have, so don't put much effort into hiding the information and you'd be surprised how few people will look, given time."
Twitch,"I have no problem skipping over the intro posts when I'm not in the mood. This is not a busy sub.   I do, however, think that the current format is a little"
Twitch,"You have some valid points. But like others have mentioned your argument of "twitch should make it's own software, like OBS, because OBS will die" is bad. If anything twitch should actively attempt to engage with such communities and guide them or even help them. OBS is an open source community on Github and they're rewriting their software to be multi-platform available on  the issue is the number of people contributing is limited and it could be so much faster with more  skilled people, it would especially be good if somebody from twitch helped as that would possibly enable to program to handle handshakes with twitch servers to be handled better i.e. better quality/connections.   Now the rest I'm not exactly sure, I mean regarding this so called DJWheat dude. But I totally agree with the API, the API is fucking ridiculous.. I tried making my own twitch bot and am actively working on it on github (private) however I just couldn't figure out how to do a simple 'uptime' command, until I found out that one would have to query the system and check for multiple places to see if it's online or offline ( That could be handled so much easier.. and it was previously. In one of the previous versions there was an "up_time" variable that could be queried and it would return something, iforgets what.   HTML5 they said they'd work on but it would be a long one. If anything they need to work on more ingest servers.. I'm streaming from Canada and it's just been horrible, why does the EU get several ones our Chicago one is removed and Canada gets nothing?   Overall yes there are issues, yes they can be handled better and more efficiently, yes the entire thing needs to be recoded because my total views haven't updated for the past 4 days and I've streamed 2 of those and have +20 new visitors so that's at least +20 views. Also it's unacceptable that the follower count on some other ppls stream is 0 at some point, like the only reason that is allowed to happen is if during load-time the server was unable to reach the database and retrieve the value but a simple refresh should fix it. Or if they're caching the follower count which also makes sense, then if(LastCount > Now) {echo LastCount} else {echo Now} and not 0 where Now would store the possibly failed value being 0.   Heck twitchcon is even a terrible idea, too much money will be invested in that stuff.. I was hoping more ingest servers, better infrastructure just general backbone upgrades and not a stupid con that costs tons to build, facilitate, and manage.   Fuck they need to fix the chat feature even more than do anything else.. it's horrible."
Twitch,"You're talking about fluff. The important API features are already there. Oauth with IRC opens the door for endless creativity. What is it that you think needs to be needed? Is it the same thing I want or what a partner wants? The problem I see with a lot of streamers that come on this subreddit is that they are looking for chat bots, flashy follower notifications, donation trackers, and other 鈥榝eatures鈥?that they think is going to make their stream successful. What they need to be doing is streaming consistently and showing off their personality. I鈥檓 not saying there is nothing to be improved or added. It鈥檚 just a low priority and I hope it stays that way.   I have never once visited a team site that provides anything extra to my Twitch viewing experience. Nor have I been compelled to subscribe to someone so I can get access to a team site. It鈥檚 nothing but fluff. Some may find it nice but my guess is that the large majority of people subscribing will be doing so because the stream is entertaining.  Twitch is as transparent about HTML5 as most publicly traded companies are during their quarterly earnings calls. It鈥檚 to be expected. It鈥檚 nice when the engineers throw some information our way but it鈥檚 na茂ve to expect regular updates. If that post you quoted is supposed to be a road map I hope you don鈥檛 navigate often."
NYKnicks,"Both Melo and Lin are good at what they're good at. Not sure how this compromising to accommodate each other is working out. Lin slows his pace and loses his aggressiveness whenever Melo's on the court. With Davis in play, Melo's actually making baskets. When Lin's running the court, Melo just looks lost."
NYKnicks,"Tyson didn't fire back at the Knicks, he fired back at the media (most probably ESPN itself). The Knicks have been mostly silent on his departure, but the media have published their usual B.S., quoting unnamed sources as per usual."
minerapocalypse,"Actually I wasn't even on. Conor was going to watch the fight between Cooke and BV in case you guys tried to gank Cooke.   You tried and it failed miserably.   Conor then said that he typed in chat he was there to watch. He then shouted that you were attacking him unprovoked. THEN I logged in and helped chase you away."
bugout,"When I was younger it was my knife. Everyone wanted to know why I needed a knife. Who am I going to stab? Until they needed to cut open a box or take out a splinter. One day when I was in college my friends and I went out in Philly for New Year's Eve. Our friends left us at a bar about 20 blocks from the apartment we were staying at. We walked through some nice areas and some not-so-nice areas. When we got to the apartment it was locked. It was probably 3 or 4 am. We banged on the door but no one answered. I took out my knife and somehow managed to work the lock open. I'm not really sure how (I was drunk) but it is Philly so it's probably not the first time that apt. was broken into ; )  needless to say, my friends never question why I carry a knife again.  I'm 30 and I've been carry a knife almost every day for the last 15 years. My father owns a construction company and I started working with him at a young age so carry a knife was normal for us. Not only have I never stabbed a person but I've never pulled my knife on anyone and honestly I don't think I ever would. The last thing I want is to be in a knife fight!   When I created a B.O.B. years ago everyone thought I was crazy. It started as a comfort bag. I got sick of being away from home and not having the things I need, like a sweatshirt and bug spray. So I put a bag in my car with all the things I thought I might need if away from the house for the whole day. Over the past few years the prepper mvmt has boomed and now I have many different bags for different things. Anyway, when my friends started complaining because they didn't have a sweatshirt or a hat or whatever and I just went out to the car and grabbed whatever I needed, they started to understand why I carry my BOB with me. Now the majority of my friends and family have bags too.   I don't worry too much about what people think of me and my survival gear but it is nice to know that now my friends and family are prepared too.  I think the more people that are prepared the less I have to worry about someone who didn't prepare trying to steal my shit. I know if something ever happens I my town I'm going to be looking for other people who seem prepared and try to stick together."
rage,"There is Irish-American history month. White people are totally allowed to have pride in their ethnicity. The "white" race itself is actually just a conglomeration of ethnicities that were put into one group "superior" to all other groups in America. Segregation was done along these racial lines, even though people like Italians and Irish were only admitted to the "white club" after years of mistreatment."
rage,"Because, like I said, the history of this country has been "white" and "everyone else."   "Caucasian" and "white" are terms that refer to many different "white" ethnicities. Because these people were historically defined as full, 100% "Americans," whereas everyone else was some kind of immigrant or second class person.   It's definitely not because there's some anti-white conspiracy in our forms. Census forms go back to times when there were boxes for "mulatto" and "octoroon.""
TellMeAbout,"Glad you asked.  Here's how beer is made:   First, a wort is brewed.  Wort is basically a tea made from malted grains like barley or wheat.  The grains are mixed with water at high temperatures (generally 150 to 160 degrees Farenheit) and steeped in a vessel called a mash tun for various periods of time...say, an hour or so.   The resulting wort is sparged into a boil kettle (sparging filters the grains out), and a boil volume is collected by adding hot water through the mash tun into the kettle.  The wort is a sweet tasting liquid.  Then the wort is boiled, and most of the time this is where hops are added (hops are a bitter flower added for their preservative qualities and to counteract the sweetness of the malted grains).  After the wort has sufficiently boiled down, the wort is cooled, transferred to a fermentation vessel, and the yeast is added.   This is where the wort transforms into beer.  Yeast is a tiny animal that metabolizes the sugar and transforms the wort sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.  Once the yeast has eaten its way through the food supply, the cells die off or go into dormancy, and crash out of the beer, forming a yeast cake at the bottom of the fermenting vessel.  Their waste products, namely alcohol, are left in the beer along with the uneaten malted sugars, which give the beer its taste.   Beer is then bottled or kegged, and carbon dioxide is added either by forcing it into the beer or adding extra sugar.  The yeast cells that remain in suspension will eat the extra sugar and carbonate the beer.   As for the taste, there are many different factors: types of grains, water profiles, lengths of time boiled, timing and type of hop additions, amount of hops, length of time fermented, etc.   The result is hundreds of beer styles and billions of recipes, any one of which could taste good or bad, depending on your tastes.   As to why you didn't like it when you were a kid, I'm no doctor, but I think kids generally prefer sweeter foods and drinks, and tend to shy away from bitter stuff.  I tried a beer when I was about 8 years old and hated it.  When I got to high school  I grimaced my way through a few months of keystone and coors and in college my tastes were refined, and by now I'm a goddamned beer snob.  I guess it really is an acquired taste.  I have friends who say they've always liked beer but for me at least it took some getting used to.  But I love it too.  I brew it.  You should too!  The best beer you'll ever taste is the stuff you create yourself.   edit   Fun fact: hops (humulus) is closely related to cannabis!"
mentalhealth,"Over the years I've come to use not eating as a method for feeling better...   Recently I've taken to another drought period and have lost weight.  My concern is that my mother did similar weight fluxuations and I start to see why she fluxuated cause I feel the same antidepressive affect of starving myself...   I have a recent habit of starvation that I noticed my mother did later in life which I put down to eating disorders.   Which is initially what I thought my mother had.  I'd like to think that my depression and anxiety go away when I starve myself... Socio-economic factors included."
metalmusicians,"Ryan from THG here. We're gonna be getting a few questions, so I'm gonna answer them here on reddit, first. We'll make an official announcement on Facebook/other sites later.     The audio is different than on the album and there were some last minute issues when we went to change out some sections. Andy joined the band after the album was finished. He changed the drum parts a bit to his style, and some of the parts would not have meshed up if we used the album version. We intended to retrack every instrument just to give it a complete "new" version for the video, but Saud is out of state right now and the project files got corrupted, so we had to make due and just create new models for the guitars and retrack the bass in one day. We figured we would rather people see the video on time and then fix some of the audio's off sounds later.       This was a 100% complete DIY video. We never intended for it to be a huge budget piece. I think some people were possibly expecting something extravagant, but just think of it more as a "studio" style video than an actual "music" video, otherwise, yes, you would lead yourself on to be disappointed."
Brooklyn,"I think it could, but Butler has to be more flexible on his branding and more aggressive with promotions. Brooklyn Flea Philly failed, first and foremost, because he failed to take into account the fact that Philadelphians are sensitive about being the "sixth borough" and resent a Brooklyn event showing up without renaming itself/making any effort to adapt to the local market. When you add that with the fact that there was barely any promotion/signage for the event, it's no wonder it shut down."
teenrelationships,"20/m coming in.   2 years ago for me was your July coming up. She was the best thing that ever happened to me too. We were madly in love. We spent more time together than apart and I knew her like the back of my hand. I have some advice for you. And remember this is from an old, jaded, 20 year old's hindsight.   If you want to know my story, feel free to ask, but for you...take some form of option 3. This girl obviously means the world to you right now. And that's a really special and powerful thing, especially at your age when love is innocent and your worries are minimal. Enjoy the it the best you can -- have a fucking BLAST this year.   But you're 17, after all. And when the time comes I think the most risk-averse and beneficial thing for you as well as your relationship with her, is to take separate paths. Its the cleanest, least bitter way to go. You have so much to see ahead of you, and I'm not saying that you being committed to her would stop that, but I have never learned as much as I did once I separated from my long term girlfriend in college.   I feel like in many cases LDR tend to eat away at both parties. And in the end it has the potential to fade away into an ugly nothingness when one side gradually starts to invest less and less. Its doesn't mean one person is at fault because of it, but the circumstances are incredibly difficult, especially at our age when everything in your life is upside down and all you want to do is keep a constant. I thought I was up for a LDR. I wasn't.   My opinion -- enjoy your last year together. Do everything together, see everything, experience everything. Young love is a cliche but it is a very special thing. And then when the time comes, split off. Maybe stay in contact, maybe not. Compartmentalize your beautiful, untainted memories of each other and take them with you when you go and see what the world outside of high school has to offer, knowing that you will have those forever and nothing anyone does can take them away. Maybe in a while you'll long for what once was and reconnect, but maybe in a while you'll look back and it'll bring out of you nothing but a faint smile and a rush of old memories.   Good luck."
teenrelationships,"17/M here. I'm normally one of the more active advice-givers in the subreddit... but damn, I've been completely out-classed here.   I'll throw onto the table what little advice I can give. Personally, I am a big, big sucker for true love, young love, all that stuff. I'm honestly envious of both of you, and to be completely honest... I'm even envious of the situation you're in, as silly as that might sound.   That aside... what to do? What to do. Everybody else has already given all the reason and all the advice you'll probably need... all I can offer is my perspective, what I'd do in your situation since I'm the same age as you.   What I would do is stay together until July, at least. Just like the other comments said, have a blast, enjoy yourselves, make it as good as you possibly can. And then, if you still both feel the same way as you do now... or hell, even stronger... then I would try. Damn it, I would honestly try as hard as I could to make it work.   If you can promise each-other that you'll put everything, absolutely everything you have into it... if you can look into the other's eyes and see how passionately they feel about it, if you can see tears in their eyes... then yes, it's worth fighting for.   It's gonna be hell. Oh damn, is it gonna be hell. Absence makes the heart grow fonder. But, if you can keep up the video calls and watching the odd film together, and if you can meet up the odd time... yeah, it can work. LDRs can work, it doesn't happen often but if you can get through these four years, I'd legitimately say you'll probably end up marrying each-other.   The way a friend described it to me was that for every year a couple are together in a LDR, it's worth three years of a normal relationship. That's why so few couples make it out the other side, but those that do... damn, they become so, so much stronger.   It's worth a try. And like the others, that 'what if?' question is so aching, it will kill you. I promise you, that constant, incessant 'what if?' will hurt a thousand times more than the most frustrating moments you'll have not being able to see each-other. I promise that.   Normally I answer these help posts with mostly my brain and just a bit of light-hearted humour alongside, but I wanted to answer this one with my heart, because it really touched me. You don't need to decide now. Think about it, see how you feel in July. Then, I think you'll have your answer."
RotMG,"If you haven't learned how to max characters yet (4/8+), I would stay away from purchasing any coins.   If you really wish to spend money, the starter pack ($20 and you might have to e-mail WildShadow support) or new character slots will probably improve your game play experience the most. After that point, I find that Dyes (to make my long-living characters more unique) make me want to keep playing. Vault spaces are always nice, but I personally find them too expensive for what they provide. This is just my opinion though.   Also pets stay in your pet yard after death. This question makes me think you're a new player. Avoid buying gold till you reach the end-game stage (maxing characters, doing tombs)."
RotMG,"The problem with Realm and Minecraft is they both feature time creep. They will fill any open space you set aside even if you don't set it aside for  them.   CSGO and League, on the other hand, (I'm assuming you're playing comp) have set limits. You can chunk out 90 minutes in GO, get it done, and walk away.   The key is to figure out how good you want to be at each game, and more importantly,  why  you want to be that good. If you can't justify that to yourself, you might be wasting your time. GO, for example(I played competitively for a while), you can actually focus your training and get the most out of it. Spend 15 minutes working on maps in the morning(learning corners etc), then hit the AIM map for a couple sets. Top it off with a comp game, followed by a 15 minute FFA runback and you have a nice 2 hour chunk set away. This will improve your game and allow you to manage your time.   League I'm sure is the same, you can work some fundamentals then jump in a match or whatever. I don't know much about it so I can't comment.   Realm is trickier. How do you set limits? By time? What if you're in a Tomb when time is up? Are you going to play for X Abysses? Until you get Y loot? I would just set a time limit, and just when you're done alt-f4 when your time is up. If you don't want to miss out on the end of hte tomb, don't join it.   Don't play too much competitive anything in a row, you'll get dull from the stress and start to play poorly. Then you'll get salty about the shit job you're doing and tilt even more.   DISCLAIMER: PREACHY PREACHY!   That's how to manage them time wise. As for enjoyment - have you ever questioned whether or nto you're actually enjoying what you're doing? Are you running that abyss because the abyss is fun, or because it's easy to steamroll and you get a red icon at the end? What is that doing for you in the long run? I know it's hard to resist stepping into the game, or just firing up a browser for 'a quick run', but really think about what you're doing with that time and what you're getting out of it.   I understand the pull of CS or league, though - you're competing in real time against real people, and trying to outsmart and outreflex them. It's engaging mentally and you can make some great friends working together. The teamwork skills also transfer out.   I just want to throw this out there - why not throw in some self enrichment? Build a website or something in your spare time, you'll have something concrete to show in a few months. If you want to talk about some stuff to do that isn't realm, feel free to reply or PM me.   Sorry for the long post!"
RotMG,"To be honest, unless you're good friends with someone in a top 10 guild you'll probably not get in. Most top guilds are invite only as they are at max capacity 99% of the time (even if realmeye shows <50, they keep inactive friends).   Your best bet is to just play the game normally and as you get better you'll eventually get invited into a mid-tier guild. Just make friends and have fun. The best times I've had in RotMG is when I was in a mid-tier guild called 'Bloodlust Empire'. We had an active mumble/teamspeak server and I had a blast playing with people there (even if some of them were not as skilled)."
PipeTobacco,"I'll try to skim the surface here. Vulcanite (ebonite, well ebonite is vulcanite but not necessarily mutually so) is rubber while lucite (acrylic) is hard plastic, so essentially, yes vulcanite is softer and generally more comfortable for most. While talking with pipe makers about various commissions in the past, they all would rather do vulcanite, as they've indicated that lucite is more difficult to work with. However, most factory pipes nowadays are being made with acrylic. Not Dunhill or whatever, but american ones and italian ones. It's presumably cheaper for them to do it, but I don't know about ease. Although while most I've spoken with charge more for lucite, there was one outlier that charged more for vulcanite. Which makes sense, because vulcanite in itself is more expensive, but maybe it's just so much easier to work with, they don't mind the extra cost. I think the reason more manufacturers are using it nowadays is that it essentially lasts longer through time and weathering than vulcanite, and keeps it's color and doesn't accept as many knicks and marks. It seems like this is a lengthy response, but it really is just scratching the surface on the subject."
LambdaConspiracies,"The Narrative of HL1 can lead you to believe that this was Black Mesa's first visit to Xen. This is not the case. The Lambda complex didn't need any crystal to send Gordon through to Xen IIRC. The lab in the chapter "Questionable Ethics" was built to study the aliens, there was no way it could have been built in the time of the BM incident(it had to have been built years before the incident). And of course the various Hazard Suit wearing bodies and supplies you find throughout Xen suggest previous visits.   Dr. Rosenberg in Blue Shift can give you some back story."

Miata,"Side note for anyone looking at roll bars.   I am a taller guy, and I wanted to make sure that the bar I got would clear my head in a rear-end collision and be high enough to provide proper protection in a rollover. I also wanted to be able to use my hardtop, but knew that the hard top bars were generally too short, and the bar too far back to suit my needs.   The Hard Dog Hard Core M1 non-hardtop is what I went with, and it WILL work with hardtops, you just lose use of your side latches, and there are solutions available to resolve this anyways. Didn't matter to me as my '90 doesn't have side catches for my roof side latches. In conjunction with the foamectomy, my head clears the bar completely."

It had always been my plan to play MNK and PUP from the start, but I knew I wouldn't be beating Maat with either job, so I tried with SAM first and failed, so I just burned WHM up, and EASILY beat the fight.   I then burned MNK up to my cap of 80, which took about another 12 or so hours, and then using the Aurore set capped my skills doing pages in Gustav tunnel.  Capping my skills took a surprisingly long time in comparisson. At least 6 hours.   Then I was finally able to go back into Aby and fight the worms myself. My cap was now 90, and with another lengthy worm party I was capped on exp and merits.   It will be an easy hop-and-skip to 95. Breaking from 95 to 99 is a bit trickier simply because they are allowing the use of Trust NPCs in a future patch which will make this an EASY fight.

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"In a sense your right about being genetically equal, but at the same time it is merely quarter of a single chromosome. While the male body might be built for more labor intensive work, that does not mean the work done without much labor is not equal. I do see both men and women, obviously we are not genetic clones like I am not a genetic clone of you, but the genders are equal just like all people are equal.   Jobs that are more labor intensive do not pay more and nor should they compared to the managing and planning jobs. Each job plays an essential role in how our society functions and should be paid respective to how much progress it achieves to the society. So in a perfect world ( not ruled by bankers and old money tycoons) jobs that would be paid the most are the jobs developing the advancements which is equally in the capacity of both genders.   On the point of pregnancy, yes companies do not want an asset to have to leave for an extended period of time. Though with how connected the world is with the internet it is not inconceivable that the persons work could be continued by someone else at the time. This is also comparable to if a work is involved with a large accident that leaves them unable to work for a period of time, the slack is taken up by the whole and when the person returns they are brought up to speed."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"I can relate to ahurlly and especially geekywarrior. I've always been a strong writer, and I was raised by intelligent parents in such a way that I've always been pretty confident that my communicative ability was above average.   In an engineering program, I had to retake both English I and II or whatever they were designated as.   The first time, I had a professor assign a simple paper to satisfy a course written word threshold (seriously)... a straightforward narrative essay, where you wrote about something that happened to you. "Professor" returned it to me  ungraded  because  he didn't believe it.  In fact, most of the "red ink" on my papers for this guy were points taken away for statements he literally didn't agree with, and had I totaled up any actual mistakes I'd made, they'd still be A papers. The real bastard move was the fact that he didn't issue a grade on that one narrative, and told me I'd end up with either an incomplete or and F, of which I could choose my preferred letter if I didn't withdraw (because of the word count rule). When I retook that class, I handed the new Professor all of the papers I'd written for the other D-bag, when the relevant assignment came up (she said it was alright). I handed her the exact same ones, with his grades on them. Passed with a near perfect grade, exempt from the final.   When I retook English II, it was largely because the professor I selected assigned us grammar workshops from [Chomp Chomp]( No joke. Had to print out our score page and everything. I couldn't take her seriously, and withdrew.   It all made sense when I was told by my father to stop looking at places of "higher learning" as schools, in the traditional sense, and as businesses with a bottom line."

After I came back from my weekend visit, my fiance no longer wants to do ANYTHING with me.   His friends suggest going to St. Louis for the fireworks down there. His mother said no and he started getting all pissy and throwing a hiss. We then talk for a bit. He proceeds to tell me that he is CONVINCED that I cheated on him with my best friend (another fun tid-bit, I'm related to my best friend). We break up and I don't hear from him for the rest of the month.   School starts in August and he wants to get back together and try to work on our problems. I then ask him if he has a crush on anyone else at that time. He responds with a name of a friend of ours. I tell him that I'm not getting back together with him until he can commit to me and only me.   We agree to try to be friends. We talk for a bit, a few weeks later he brings up the subject, I say no, he cusses me out. Wash, rinse, repeat.   During this time I try to move on. I met a boy that had a psycho ex that claimed to be pregnant with his kid. His family is devoutly catholic, so he's forced to break up with me, with no proof of this so called child.   My ex fiance's grandfather was diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer and he tells me he's afraid of losing me as well. I tell him that all he has to do is prove to me that I can trust him. He then asks my 17 year old friend out two weeks later.   Neither one likes condoms and she's not on birth control.   Boys, keep this in mind. I made my fiance a sandwich everyday of my own free will."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"A friend of mine went on the most racist drunken rant I've ever heard,   "Asians, Cork Asians and Black Asians are your starting races. Now you've got like, modifiers for everyone, cause everyone has modifiers. BUT NOT US. But everyone else. So it's like, Asians get plus three to work. Like, all work, but homework mostly. They understand things. They also get plus one to fighting, because of like, yakuza and shit, yo. But every upside has a downside, right, so they get minus three to dicks. Which sucks. I mean, some asians are stupid with massive dicks, but that's from like, training, you know, and getting +1 to ghetto and shit.   Now, your black person gets natural plus three to fighting, and plus two to badass. They also get a plus three to dicks. But because they're like, always oppressed and shit, they get minus three to intelligence. I'm not racist, right, but they just get less schools and don't get the same schooling as asians. But I'm not racist, you know, because they're not stupid, but they're just not smart. But like, because of society, so it's not racist to say it.   And white guys don't get any of that. We're just like, the standard race, with no bonuses. Except like, plus three to racism, because we're just  cunts . With minus three dicks versus black dudes.""
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"so is assuming you can project your own values and ideals onto other cultures but I suppose there's nothing I could do about that. The main issue here is that her Asian upbringing is conflicting with the kid's (presumably) American sociocultural values. I'm going to refer to Asians as specifically the Chinese because I can't speak for any other Asian cultures from experience. Whereas Asians value discipline and familial piety Americans value expression and independence.   Asian parents pull this shit because they believe it will encourage their child to do the best.  Although many might say otherwise, I don't think Asian parents actually expect perfection so much as they expect you to strive for it. Typically ABCs understand this and are resilient to the perceived "harshness" of the upbringing and end up better than do western kids raised in similar environments. However, I feel that recently the reception to this parenting style has taken a turn for the worse due to a much larger negative social stigma attached to the authoritarian style of parenting resulting in Asian children taking their parenting in a manner similar to western children. Thus it would seem that "fighting back" just increases problems for the kids while simultaneously depressing the parents. So while white-knighting them is admirable, it's really not helping anything during development.   In the end, the only thing you can really do in a western country is wait for these generations of discontent to pass and for the "suppressed" children to become parents themselves and slowly adjust generation by generation until all of the Authoritarian Asian parenting is kicked out of them. I have a couple of 3rd generation friends that this has already happened to and they're as whitewashed as you can get.   I posted pretty much the same thing in the same thread [here]("

Nor we cannot narrow the reason for the immigrants leave their country. Some are cult, some are not; some need the language in their daily tasks, some perhaps not.   In addition, something particular, USA is one of countries with the biggest amount of Spanish speakers in the whole world; this fact cannot be ignored.

Even a person called a "hermaphrodite" will only have 1 functional urethra, so whichever one they have (either one that goes through the penis or one that goes to the vulva), that's the one they'd use.""

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"To the brother: Dudebro, by the time I entered my freshman year of college i had 6 of 7 girlfriends cheat on me. So head my advice my friend. If someone cheats on their significant other then obviously their heart is not fully into the relationship. Now I know from experience that when it happens it sucks. It seems like there is nobody out there who can be like her and make you happy. But trust me, there is someone. Someone who will be fully committed to you.   But sadly here is the catch. That special someone doesn't wait around forever. If you stay in this relationship you may end up missing your shot at landing an absolutely amazing girlfriend. A girlfriend who would never cheat on you and that would make you so happy that your ex would quickly pale in comparison.   Breaking up is tough, trust me. I've been there. A HELL OF A LOT OF TIMES. Yea, it hurts like a bitch at first. Surround yourself with friends and try to get your feet back on solid ground. Take some time to stay single and evaluate what you want and don't want in a relationship. Once you realize this then look to who fits what you want. And go from there however it may be. And honestly sometimes that amazing someone may just fall right into your lap when you're least expecting it.   Billions of people live on this planet. There is someone out there that is perfect for you. Trust me. Just for fucks sake man, don't let the chance of being truly happy pass you by.   Because happiness is one this every person is entitled to.   (Apologies for any gramatical errors and such, after the fourth longneck my fingers don't work as well.)"

I am 17 years old now and I probably starting putting that stuff on my face when I was in 6th grade when I got my first pimples.

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"I'm going to agree and disagree here... yes it is true that every subreddit has it's zealots and assholes. But it is certainly not the case that is is equal across the board. The thing is that you just might be blind to it, because you are a part of it. Now, I'm not trying to say anything about 2XC as I have never been there myself, so I won't make judgements... but let me give you an example. Reddit always says that r/atheism is full of zealots and assholes, but quite frankly, I don't see it at all. I attribute this to the fact that I am an Atheist, and I find religion to be quite retarded. So maybe I'm one of the zealots? Now again I'm not going to make claims about 2XC, but consider the fact that you might be seeing less zealotry because you relate better to the zealots than some of the people disagreeing with you here. Of course these people disagreeing need to consider the reverse as well... they are probably seeing more zealotry because they don't fit in with the general mindset over there. Another example where I've been on the outskirts is r/minecraft. I browse that subreddit as I really love Minecraft, however I personally feel that subreddit is full the worst circlejerky nothch worshippers in existance... if you have a rational disputing opinion, you get downvoted and people tell you to "stop fucking complaining", then they also assume I'm just a minecraft/notch hater. If I try to discuss this with anyone, most people think I'm crazy and say that r/minecraft is an extremely welcoming community.   I think my general point is that yes, every subreddit does have it's zealots and assholes... but no one can clearly say what the percentages are because it varies from perspective to perspective. You may see 2XC has being pretty standard, where as some of the more frequent visitors over there might say it is less zealotry and more level headed than most subreddits... and then you'll have the other end of the spectrum saying that its the craziest subreddit out there."
fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"Well I obviously can't make a really strong judgement only spending 30 minutes over there... but I'll report my findings...   Not what I was expecting at all. From what I had heard of 2XC I was expecting it to be like a feminist thread (Not femnazis, just feminists). But it's really just a subreddit for women talking about woman stuff! Not only that but there was very obviously a lot of men on there as well. I read a lot of submissions and comments and found VERY little downvoting or hating on dissenting opinions.   Not my cup of tea really as I'm a dude that isn't into girly things at all... I even date a girl that might be more of a man than I am. Call me immature... but I particularly don't like to hear about anything period related... my girlfriend doesn't like to talk about that shit either, so I know I'm not being sexist about that. I'm also the kind of guy that doesn't like it when girls embellish the fact that they burp/fart... but that's because I don't like it when guys do either! I burp with my mouth closed. But there were a few submissions that very much interested me (mostly the relationship/sex advice).   All in all, it seems like a fine subreddit and some of the forever alones over here are just being what they are... forever alones. I wouldn't bother arguing with them much honestly... F7U12 in my opinion is one of the worst subreddits as far as trolls go, but I guess that just comes with the territory."

fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu,"Fire as you see it (flames, etc.) Is just hot waste (ash and gasses) being produced by the exothermic reaction going on.  When an object is really hot, it glows red (releases red light), and shifts towards white (metal heats in this way).  The difference is the gasses aren't visible, but they still release light similarily to how solids do.  This is why gasses that are very hot will make "flames" which is red light less concentrated (hence it seems see-through in parts).  A solid bar of metal is solid and has many more atoms producing red light, until it's so hot it reflects all light and glows white.  Few things will glow red, because when exciting their atoms, it will change their state (water), or will combust them (wood, gasoline, plants, etc.)   Some materials will release non-red light upon combustion, which is why some chemicals glow green, blue or purple when combusting.  This isn't due to excited atoms or heat, because some of the reactions create so little heat you can put your hand in them longer than normal and not burn yourself.

The show primarily follows two IT geeks, Moss and Roy, neither of which know much about sports.   In one episode (S03E02 "Are We Not Men"), they try to socialize with others by repeating generic sports phrases that would work in many scenarios. One of the phrases, as seen in the comic, was:   >The thing about Arsenal is, they always try to walk it in."

In other words, the event that caused the sound (sometime in the past) preceded the event of feeling the bullet ( present ). This is  always  true for events that are separated by a distance such that light could travel between that distance in the time interval in which those events took place. This is called time-like separation. The order of time-like separated events  are set in stone and are thus said to be causally connected. This of course is assuming nothing can go faster than c.

That said, this reasonable system's weakness is that protesters inevitably claim they did not hear it.

worldnews,"On the linked page Charmaine Borg has a very eloquent and readable response ([link](   > Mr. Speaker, when examining the provisions of a bill, I think parliamentarians have a duty to ask themselves a simple question: will this bill improve our society? Today we are looking at Bill C-309, An Act to amend the Criminal Code (concealment of identity). I have no doubt that the author of this bill was motivated by a desire to improve public safety. That seems to be the answer the government automatically gives these days. Thus, members really need to ask themselves if this bill is an effective way to improve public safety.   > Let us be clear: like all parties, the NDP condemns any vandalism and criminal behaviour at any assembly. Furthermore, we fully agree that any crime committed by someone wearing a mask deserves a tougher sentence. The NDP fully supports the sections of the Criminal Code that protect the public against seditious behaviour, vandalism and the masked individuals who commit these acts. What worries me, however, is the direction in which bills like this on public safety are taking us. I imagine this bill was drafted in response to the problem of crimes committed anonymously by people wearing masks during unlawful assemblies or riots.   > No one is denying the troubling images that came out of the recent riots in Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. In fact, I have a great deal of empathy for all the small businesses and shops that were damaged during these demonstrations. It is extremely sad, and I hope they will be compensated for this. In some cases, some of the offenders did indeed wear masks; I am aware of that. If this bill truly is a response to those events, then it is the responsibility of this House to determine whether it is a suitable and adequate response. Let us look at the content of this bill.   > It proposes two very simple changes to the Criminal Code. Clause 2 of the bill calls for a change to section 65 of the Criminal Code making it a criminal offence to wear a mask or any other disguise when participating in a riot. The bill also proposes amending section 66 of the Criminal Code, which is essentially the same thing, but in the context of an unlawful assembly.   > I want to come back to my original question: will this legislation improve our society? Changing our society for the better means recognizing a problem and being willing to solve it. As I was saying before, the NDP fully supports subsection 351(2) of the Criminal Code, which makes it an offence to cover one's face in the commission of a crime. The courts have recognized that wearing a mask during the commission of a crime can be considered an aggravating factor during sentencing. There are existing measures for handing down tougher sentences for an act committed by a criminal who wears a mask.   > How will this bill help Canadians? Is the purpose of Bill C-309 to make it illegal to take part in a riot or unlawful assembly? In that case, Canadians are already protected by the Criminal Code. If the purpose of the bill is to introduce punitive measures against someone who commits a crime, such as vandalism, while taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly, Canadians are already protected by the Criminal Code, as I explained previously. If the purpose is to increase sentences for individuals who commit crimes while concealing their identity, once again, Canadians are protected by court decisions.   > Under the Criminal Code, taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly and committing vandalism or other crimes during an unlawful assembly are already illegal, and concealing one's identity while committing a crime during an unlawful assembly or riot is considered to be an aggravating factor. Therefore, I question the need for this bill. I believe that it is basically redundant. The main issues of public safety that are the basis for this bill are already covered by the Criminal Code. This bill's only new contribution is to make it an offence to conceal one's identity while taking part in a riot or unlawful assembly.   > According to this bill, an individual could be detained, arrested, indicted and sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison simply for being a masked spectator in the area of an unlawful assembly.   > In June 2010, during the G20 in Toronto, Canadians witnessed how a small riot led to police crackdowns. The result: thousands of innocent people were arrested and detained. Approximately 1,500 Canadians were arrested or detained as a result of a riot involving fewer than 20 people. The authorities subjectively considered the whole demonstration as an unlawful assembly and took away the civil liberties of 1,500 innocent demonstrators, journalists and spectators. We must remember these events when we are considering a bill such as this one.   > The limitations imposed on civil liberties to ensure public safety must be the least restrictive possible. I think that all the hon. members would agree with me on this. Otherwise, there is no limit to the restrictions that can be imposed on fundamental freedoms.   > I would also like to point out that this bill takes away an individual's right to demonstrate anonymously. An individual is not necessarily going to commit a crime just because he or she is wearing a mask at a riot. It is reasonable to think that the person just wants to remain anonymous and protect his or her identity.   > In the context of this bill, we must recognize the risk of political profiling of people exercising their civil liberties. Too often, 99% of protestors are peaceful, while 1% choose to vandalize. More often than not, this 1% is condemned by the vast majority of the peaceful protestors. As we saw in Toronto in June 2010, the peaceful protestors and spectators can be close to non-peaceful protestors. But this bill could lead to the arrest of innocent protestors who wear masks because of their geographic proximity to non-peaceful protestors.   > It bears repeating that criminals who conceal their identity are already punished more severely in this country. I also want to point out that this bill would give judges the discretionary power under the Criminal Code to consider an offence committed while wearing a mask as an aggravating factor. Some people may consider that to be a good thing. However, a 2005 judgment by the Provincial Court of Alberta, R. v. Potter, already provides that protection.   > I would like to thank the member for introducing this bill in the House. I understand the source of his concerns. However, in its current form, this bill is redundant and could have serious consequences for civil liberties in this country. I encourage members in this House to carefully examine the implications of this bill and to ask themselves whether it is worth jeopardizing our civil liberties. I am leaving it up to the House to decide on an appropriate course of action."
worldnews,"Most of the comments here seen to be written w/o an appreciation of  context.   Yes, we know laws against wearing face coverings @ protests have already been in place in various countries for decades.   And yes - on the surface - there seems to be some good reasons for having a law like this.   The problem  is a contextual one, as to the political environment a law like this is appearing in,  and  the kinds of technology available to state officials, wealthy private bodies, etc.   This law is appearing in the midst of the global emergence of  popular, democratic uprising .  It appears in an age of  increasingly reliable facial recognition software.   And it is being proposed by a government that has  demonstrated  a keen interest in general "police state" measures, intentional abuse of law, and secrecy.   So shrugging and saying this is "no big deal" because some liberal social-democratic welfare states in western Europe established such measures 20-30 yrs ago  completely misses the point."

I am, however, a White man, so it's silly to say I'm hateful against myself twice.   I did know that Fred Phelps was in the Civil Rights movement, but how does that indict the NAACP?? Phelps' church is abhorrent because of their stunty homophobia, not because they advocate for too much help for Black people - which they never, ever have.   Honestly, the assertion that the NAACP is racist - is racist. It's based on a fear that Blacks are getting more than they deserve. I understand a lot of Americans can think that without being terrible people - just ignorant. But look at what you're saying: the only racism that exists today is "reverse-racism". Black Americans don't need extra attention because racism against them is over. That's a stunning proposition!   I agree the NAACP should disband when racism against Blacks ceases. But I just cited incontrovertible evidence of anti-Black racism today. [Here's the MIT-Chicago study.]( What's  your  basis for saying racism is over?   Americans were polled on racism a hundred years ago too - and the overwhelming majority said there was no racism against Black people. Same exact thing in the Civil Rights era. I agree things are better now than in the past, but it seems that every generation of Americans thinks racism is over, and we can move on and make equal demands on everyone. They said it a decade after slavery was over. But it's simply not true.   Japanese Americans got reparations from the United States government, by the way, and they were represented by the [JACL]( which is still running today, and says that it's mission is "to protect the rights of all Asian Pacific Americans".

Just to explain for everyone the reason behind this protest, am gonna recap some points, 1) last year there was a yes or no vote about wether the Egyptian people make the constitution before or after the presidential elections.   2) the muslim brotherhood and salafists wanted to make the constitution first so they tricked the lower class , that if they voted no they go to hell, if they vote yes they go to heaven, and since Egypt was blessed with many ignorants, illiterates, they voted yes for constitution first, now all they have to do is to make those very same people to vote for them in the parliament.   3) guess who again, the same suspects, the Muslim brotherhood and salafists won the majority of the parliament seats, they decided eventually that the 100 persons that will be making the constitution will be 50%from the parliament ( that they own) and 50% from outside the parliament which of course no one agreed about it, and it failed, but not after it drained precious time.   4) now since the constituation committee failed by a court order, they have to start all over again, they need to pick another 100 people with ratios which everyone must agree about, and actually make a constitution in ....... 2 months instead of what should have been 6 months, but cause of the brotherhood and salafists, the Egyptians lost 4 months   5) now the military got the cards, the people voted yes for constitution first, and at the moment there is not constitution, not even the committee, not even the standards of who to pick, by law he is correct, the people wanted constitution first they will grant it, it's like a forced penetration exactly, u gonna take it wether u like it or not."
worldnews,"The article has quite a few inaccuracies. Horthy didn't start serious mass persecution and deportation of Jews until the Germans invaded in 1944.   > Horthy and his government supplied 10,000 Jewish deportees for labor battalions, but otherwise refused to comply. Cautiously, the Hungarian government began to explore contacts with the Western Allies in hopes of negotiating a surrender.   It wasn't until he started trying to find a way to join the allies or surrender to them (Hitler got word of this and 'summoned' him to a meeting) that his new government was forced to deport a large number of Hungary's Jews to German camps after they invaded the country.   > Horthy was told he could only stay in office if he fired K谩llay and appointed a new government that would fully cooperate with Hitler and his plenipotentiary in Budapest, Edmund Veesenmayer. Knowing the alternative was a gauleiter who would treat Hungary in the same manner as the other countries under Nazi occupation, Horthy acquiesced and appointed his ambassador to Germany, General D枚me Szt贸jay, as prime minister. The Germans originally wanted Imr茅dy, but Horthy had enough influence to get Veesenmayer to accept Szt贸jay instead. Contrary to Horthy's hopes, Szt贸jay's government eagerly proceeded to participate in the Holocaust.   --   > It is often argued that Hungary's "relatively mild" anti-Jewish Laws, which were passed under German pressure, appeased the Nazis enough to create a relatively safe environment for the Jews before the 1944 German invasion.[36] It seems certain that the survival of 124,000[37] Hungarian Jews in Budapest until the arrival of the Soviets would have been impossible without Horthy鈥檚 years of foot-dragging reluctance to implement German orders.[38][need quotation to verify] On 15 July 1944 Anne McCormick, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times wrote in defense of Hungary as the last refuge of Jews in Europe, declaring that 鈥渁s long as they exercised any authority in their own house, the Hungarians tried to protect the Jews.鈥?  The article deliberately fails to mention that it was only after the Nazis invaded the country and Germany asserted full control over Hungary that they started to fully comply with the Genocidal policies of Hitler. The article deliberately attempts to absolve Germany of any guilt in the crimes committed under Horthy when the truth is that almost ALL of the crimes committed against the Jews at that time were to appease Germany. The rise in nationalism and the growing acceptance of these historical figures as 'heroes' is a serious issue and Der Spiegel ruined an important piece of journalism by deliberately twisting the history to avoiding mentioning the fact that Germany played the major role in extermination of Hungary's Jews and that the Hungarian regime was a reluctant and initially unwilling participant."
worldnews,"Right. Yeah, that is generally what happens in the United States. The only times suicides are reported are when they are like, Kurt Cobain. Then, it's only because he was a cultural icon. Speaking as someone who has had a few friends and family members commit suicide, the obituary is really the only thing that is published and that is at the hands of the family, and they usually don't say it was suicide because, frankly, they usually don't believe that their loved one killed themselves. They want to believe it was murder or an accident, and sometimes self inflicted deaths genuinely are accidents, ESPECIALLY among drug users and particularly among opiate/opioid addicts who also take a benzodiazepine or several benzos.   Case and point, Heath Ledger died by his own hand but it wasn't suicide(although some people have speculated it was), this is something I can speak to myself, as someone who has had some pretty serious prescription drug abuse issues(with literally all of the drugs he overdosed on, which includes "oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, and alprazolam" according to the toxicology report performed as part of his autopsy). In cases of high profile deaths, the media is going to report it, and eventually the cause of death is going to be released somehow, perhaps the family releases information as a way to send a message to folks struggling with addiction or depression to get help, or because in this day and age, people are more concerned with getting paid or getting their 15 minutes of fame for breaking some story of a celebrity death than they are with how the family and friends of the deceased are treated by reporters and the information is "leaked".   I mean, I can only imagine going to my son, father, cousin, nephew, wife, daughter, girlfriend, sister, or any funeral, you know, of someone that I loved and having a huge crowd of people I have to basically push and shove as I'm bombarded with really inappropriate questions(considering that the media ACTS all sad and caring as they sit in the press tent covering the funeral live, when really, they are showing what kind of scum they really are, remember the Whitney Houston funeral where they asked questions about the service to people as they left the funeral? That was so shitty of them to do and really made me start questioning the integrity of not just American media but of the WORLDS media, and that whole phone hacking scandal shows it isn't just the American media who are FUBAR).   As someone who has overdosed on opiates(once on methadone and once on oxymorphone) and by overdose I mean a real overdose where I am absolutely certain I would have died if not for the fact that an ambulance was called because I was cyanotic(cyanosis is when you aren't breathing and turn blue as a result, completely unresponsive, and without naloxone, basically dead) twice, I have seen the result of my terrible decisions and how those decisions hurt my family...particularly my mom, who on both occasions, was the one who found me, and on my dad, who on both occasions, was the one who performed CPR...I just can't imagine if I was famous and my mom and dad had to answer questions that they don't need to face on what is possibly the worst day of their life(the day of my hypothetical funeral as a result of one of my previous OD's) , questions like "DID YOUR SON COMMIT SUICIDE?", "DID YOU KNOW YOUR SON WAS A DRUG ADDICT?", "WHY DID HE DO THIS? WE WERE FANS, WE WERE COWORKERS MAKING MONEY TOGETHER, HOW COULD HE LEAAAVE US, EVEN FROM THE GRAVE WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO EXPLOIT HIM, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW WE COULD DO THAT? MAYBE HAVE A RED CARPET FUNERAL AND ASK THESE SORTS OF QUESTIONS?", I mean just imagine that, I know my addiction is my fault, and having lived through an overdose, I know what the families went through, I've seen it, imagine the world making a media spectacle of your death or your moms death...it's just fucking terrible.   So luckily, in cases of true, 100% certain cases of suicide, the person has to be pretty famous or notorious to get media attention(the lucky part meaning that the media doesn't cover many cases as a suicide because the investigators don't tell the media it even was a suicide to avoid copy cats, unfortunately people who commit suicide and who are famous tend to have fans and after their death, a lot more fans, and a lot of those fans can be quite ill and may harm themselves). Mostly, the only media attention self inflicted deaths, accidental or intentional, receive is in the obituary.   And I know your comment really didn't need a response like this but I just needed to get these feelings off my chest,"
worldnews,"Sorry for taking so long to reply to this, been at work and then out drinking (so this response is posted in a somewhat drunken state where I take no responsibility for any factual or grammatical errors).   Seeing as I cannot find any crime under article II of the original [treaty]( between the US and Sweden which would cover WikiLeaks release of classified documents, I don't really see how an extradition request would at all be possible, according to the treaty? Further, article V.2 fotbids extradition in cases where the requesting state regards the crime as political. The US would probably circumvent article V.2 though.   Article VI(b) of the [supplementary treaty]( which concerns temporarily surrendering a suspect, refers this to an  extradition request , i.e. a crime which falls under article II, mentioned above."
worldnews,"Are there other people who are scared of the current situation between politics and the internet? I have this bad feeling that we might be entering a pre-phase of civil war (worst case).   On the one hand, there are many people who want to have a censorship free internet. On the other hand, there are people, mostly those with power, who want to see the internet censored. However, the later is a minority.   Then we have the current internet, still relatively uncensored, allowing people to band together and form hacker groups (not talking about anonymous). These hacker groups only fight to bring forth the truth which governments try to hide.   In the middle of this is Assange as the informal representative of the uncensored internet. Prosecution of Assange will ultimately provoke "truth fighters" and lead to serious attacks on government websites. Consequently, sensitive government information will be leaked, giving an actual reason for "quick measurements" from the governments. So the witch-hunt for hackers starts.   Once in this phase, underground systems and safe-houses for hackers start to develop and the people of the internet will start public campaigns against government policies. There will be flash-mobs every day, demonstrating the power of a world united through the internet and our governments will be scared. So they can do two things: "Fight or give up."   If the governments give up, the internet becomes truly uncensored. However, and this is what I fear, if the government chooses to fight, a civil war will be inevitable.   So I wonder if I am just imagining things or is fear is justified?"
worldnews,"On the face of it, yeah, 700 grams is a lot.  But I don't think it's necessarily as bad as you might think.  In fact, if you're offended by drug related crime, you should probably be in favor of casual users stock piling around that much...   See, if you smoke on the regular, that much weed is still going to run out.  You're not going to use 700 grams all at once, so that volume has to be judged by consumption rate and accessibility of resupply.  That resin  might be his absolute primo stash that he dips into on rare occasion, and if he can only resupply every 3 years....  Basically, for some smokers (all day, erry day, amiright?), 700 grams can be 'just enough' and then they are totally satisfied in terms of drug transactions for a long while.   Which brings me back to crime: since we can't keep even drugs out of super max prisons, let's work under the assumption that people are still going to be able to score on occasion.  Do we want lots of drug transactions with lots of hard to prosecute interactions, easy cash flow, and low costs of entry to the market combined with high investigatory costs?  Or do we want an industry that requires deep pockets to play around in (providing legal surface area and related assets), is continually dealing in significant volumes (minimizing the number of players), and with a minimum number of targets to legislate, investigate, and regulate all while having a more predictable supply to minimize market opportunity to new entrants?   Smokers going out and scoring here and there keeps the drug war broad and wide, and punishes responsible users who get hit with disproportionate penalties for living their lives in a more law abiding manner.  And the only upside is more drug dealers who exist in an easier, more profitable, market.   Home or regional growers supplying large volumes of nationally grown weed to residential users for personal use (through the mail for example), would be indistinguishable from our current drug  use  situation, but would give us a fighting chance to eliminate the violent crime aspect of prohibition.  It also provides a reasonable framework for full taxation and national price competition (putting unsustainable cost pressure on illegal dealers), and can even be extended (through NAFTA), to deny  billions  of dollars every year to central and south american crime syndicates."

worldnews,"As an Iranian, I'm tired of reading this narrative by other Iranians. This is dishonest not only to non-Iranians but a self delusional explanation for the dire state of Iran. Not only do I think it's foolish to compare Iranians to Israelis culturally, a lot of Iranians tend to say the mullahs are different than the people and that their policies is not a reflection of everyday Iranians. This is simply not true.   The Islamic Republic has a strong support in Iran among merchants, rural residents, low-mid income families and the religious elite. And although some of its social values are not shared among the young educated Iranians, its culture of oppression and "king like rule" is still relevant even among them.   Iranians may set up rave parties in their basements or have bottles of whiskey in their homes, but culturally they're not ready for democracy. The idea of freedom of speech or questioning authority is something that has not settled well in Persian culture. For example the father figure still has the last word on most family matters and the idea of younger people speaking their minds is usually frowned upon. These are traditions that have defined Persian people for generation, and until they're overcome at the micro level, you can't expect a regime like the Islamic Republic becoming irrelevant at the macro level.   That was just one example, but there many more like it that demonstrate a lack of readiness by Iranian for true democracy. However, I don't believe it's all bad news. I believe out of all islamic/arab countries in the middle east, Iran is by far the most progressive. For example in recent years there has been a progressive push in sexual openness and family planning. However, like I said there is still a long way to go."

However, he did tell say that the rural people support the idiots that are the Mullah.

worldnews,"In a products liability tort action involving a manufacturing defect, all the middlemen may be joined in the suit and found strictly liable (meaning they may be found liable without proof of careless or fault). The reasoning is that although they did not cause the defect, they nonetheless sold a product that was defective. Most jurisdictions impose joint and several liability, which means each of the defendants is liable for the entire amount of the damages though the plaintiff may only collect up to the amount of the injury (to clarify, if one of the defendants is insolvent or has no insurance, the other defendants bear the load so that the victim's collection is not reduced).   There are two major schools of view in tort law, there is the non-instrumentalist view as nuttybuddy mentioned, that the purpose of tort law is to redistribute injury to compensate the victim because the corporations have deeper pockets and can more reasonably handle the damages. The instrumentalist view, which is more of an economical approach, is that the purpose of tort law is to discourage non-efficient behavior, making everybody better off as a whole."
worldnews,"Don't get me wrong, since you're not the only one by a long shot, but all you did was toss out a cliche to minimize the topic under discussion.   With all due respect, there is actually a huge amount of wrong with having opinions based upon faulty premises or complete ignorance. All you've got to do is visit Reddit for one day and you'll see a cajillion opinions on subjects where people haven't a clue or, worse, think they know something based upon what they'd previously heard or learned.   As a matter of fact, I've about come to the conclusion that it's opinions--like yours--that have gotten us to where we are today (at least in the US of A).   If you'll indulge me, I'll explain. I submit that sometime in my lifetime there arose a notion of reporting he said, she said--i.e. let the viewers decide--implicitly endorsing the notion of everyone's got a right to an opinion, but the trouble is that people have a tendency of swallowing more readily something if they think they're getting it from a fount of wisdom, such as the media--whether it be the NYT, CNN or Fake Noise--a government figure, a corporate voice (lol), or even (quelle horror) an academic study or book.   I trust most will admit that one or more of the above suspects are hardly credible all the time, if ever, but there are people like you who will sop something up as if it's manna from heaven and then go around spouting off as if you're now an expert and reply to someone, that's just your opinion, especially if that opinion rubs up against something you've previously held as true. It's why we're so dumb compared to our ancestors--don't get me started and tell me we're smarter.   If everything is an opinion, then there can never be synthesis, knowledge or (gasp) truth, which I'd contend is perhaps closer to the truth than you or I would be willing to admit, although it would tend to to corroborate my original point, which is that people go around spewing opinions on things they have no idea what they're talking about or utter absolute nonsense, but it's their opinion so we've got to let it pass unchecked, as you did, presuming it answers everything, when it answers nothing.

worldnews,"Yeah, it's fairly obvious that the US government's solution to any "problem" is to send the people they have a problem with away for an undetermined amount of time.   It mainly has to do with the war on drugs, the percentage of incarcerated people in the United States jumped 700 percent from 1970 to 2005.  One in three black men can expect to go to prison, and they account for 60% of the prison population.  Black communities are mainly targeted in the war on drugs, even though black people are no more likely to use or sell drugs than white people.   It's modern slavery and racism disguised in a war on drugs to "protect our children."  You see, many prisons (ESPECIALLY in the South, which has the highest amount of black people) have a work program.  You don't have to work, but you'll want to and most people end up doing it because they say things like you'll get off for good behavior.  Also, being stuck in a cell all day sucks.  You'll want to go work.   In the Mississippi State Penetentry that my father went to, you did farm work.

They don't cover news until they are %100 sure it's true and confirmed by other sources; if they air every claim on social media like "police executing and shooting protesters" then the situation could turn to a full fledged civil war.   When Erdo臒an threatens protesters with his usual bully attitude that he can gather 1 million people for every thousand protesters, he's sadly right. As far its known he didn't cheat at ballot and more than %50 of population really elected him (considering it's not two party system it's frigging huge). Lots of people (especially muslims) literally worship him and he's some kind of hero in their eyes.

I remember reading once, can't find any citations now of course so feel free to dismiss this anecdote if you wish, in a newspaper about a small business owner brought to book by HMRC.  His VAT returns were all wrong.   They prosecuted him, as you'd expect.  They froze his assets, as they have the power to do, in the meantime, to stop him sending his money abroad.   So far, so standard.  Things took a less than perfect turn when he was denied legal aid on account of having too much money already, but he couldn't hire a solicitor, as all his assets were frozen.  Forced to defend himself at court, he failed to make his case and was found guilty.   The punchline: he'd paid TOO MUCH tax.  They'd brought the full power of the system against an incompetent business owner after discovering he'd paid too much tax.  They could have: a) simply returned it, b) fined him for shoddy book-keeping.  But no, they used the full power of the system to make an example.   What's this got to do with the bankers?  Well, the only reason they haven't been charged (and some of them actually have, but then we've got the Americans to thank for making a fuss of the LIBOR scandal, our own policy makers weren't interested.) is because the people in charge haven't been looking.   Given the scope of laws and regulations concerning accounting, and the broad interpretation of the common law of fraud, and the always present "insider trading", I'd bet you could get serious jail time against half the working population of the City if you wanted to.

worldnews,"I'm a soldier currently laying in my bunk at training, and I believe I can provide some insight here. There is a lot of "kill kill kill" mentality in training. It's part of the "soldierization" process. As social animals, most of us have a strong aversion to killing other humans. The idea with the training process is to get people to the point where in the heat of combat, soldiers don't freeze up and get killed, or worse, get her soldiers killed. That's why there are the violent marching cadences and until somewhat recently, bayonet training are for.   However, I should also add that we are also taught that we are responsible for our actions. Careful weapons handling because we should never point the weapon at something we are not willing to destroy. Rules of engagement designed to prevent civilian casualties often require us to wait for someone to be shooting at us to be allowed to shoot back. And having spent months with these men and women as part of this process, I can confidently say that 99% of them joined for reasons other than to kill. Were they aware that they were joining a profession where that is a distinct possibility? Yes. But most do want the school benifits. Many are motivated by the steady job and income. Others by the adventure, challenging work and being part of what is still seen as an honorable profession. But only a very bare handful have I ever seen that simply wanted to be paid to shoot people. And those few are shunned by the rest because that kind of bloodthirsty attitude makes people very uncomfortable. Even guys in the infantry, whose job is purely to shoot things, tend to have other motivations. Lots of them chose the infantry because they wanted to protect. They are perfectly happy sitting around the barracks playing video games (World of Warcraft and EVE seem to be the game of the night). They'll whine about having to clean or do whatever stupid time wasting duties are lined up for the day. But almost all of them would admit that any of that is preferable to having to take another human's life. And the only extreme circumstance where they are willing to do so is when that human being becomes a threat to the people and things they love.  Also, to directly address part of your comment, some people are very bothered by the reality that we may have to kill. Whether they didn't think it through, or they find themselves unable to learn from and evolve past the violent mentality of training, some people are simply unable to live in this atmosphere. I actually had a friend drop out, simply telling me "I just can't kill people, man." And that's totally fine."

worldnews,"According to my logic, you should be a little more understanding if you meet a white dude that grew up in Compton and is wary of black people. It doesn't justify racist behaviors, but it can sometimes help us understand why those feelings exist.   No. If he's constantly exposed to it (i.e raised in Compton) he should be more comfortable than anyone else around blacks, unless you're actually suggesting every single last black person in Compton either robbed him, treated him like shit, or just refused to socialize with him. I highly doubt this would be the case.   He might have a thing against  racism  because he was probably treated like shit arbitrarily a lot, and he might understand that racism is a sword that cuts both ways, but how could this possibly lead him to hate blacks? It doesn't work this way when all your friends, school life, work, home, etc are there and the majority of the population falls into a homogenized category. If we can assume he wasn't raised in isolation within a homogeneous white group who spew hate speech constantly entrenched in Compton for no apparent reason, and as I mentioned before, experienced all sorts of bad shit from every side and every angle, there's no reason for us to believe he would be racist. Maybe very opposed to Compton "gangsta" culture, which some people will  call  racist, but that's really just the politically correct bullshit America faces, where everyone but whites are immune to cultural criticism because it's "racist" or "discriminatory" otherwise.   I'm most definitely not going to stand here and say Roma are great. I've been to Europe, and a lot of them are thieves and scam artists, no one disagrees. But guess what?

Not to mention you're now several generations removed from said atrocities and these kids were taught these crimes in a very dry manner. (A few pictures of dead bodies here, a few pages about how many non-combatants were killed and maybe a paragraph about comfort women). Although there are supplementary materials used by teachers (who are often derided as left wing for their attempts to stop schools from using "nationalist texts") to attempt to evoke empathy (like diaries and selected excerpts from testimonials), the fact that the atrocities are not tested on College Entrance exams really just makes students give less of a shit.   The vast majority of young Japanese (like young Americans) do not vote reliably (namely those Japanese born after 1982 as they were taught under the revised M.O.E policy of teaching war crimes as prior to that, WW2 was a bit whitewashed) And with regards to the rest of the electorate, given the 20  year slump they were in, would prioritize the economy/domestic issues above all else.

For example, Japan's dispute with Russia gets virtually zero media coverage (as well as the Dokdo/Takeshima dispute with S. Korea) nowadays.   Essentially what Japan did with the Diaoyu/Senkaku islands is run up and slam their flag down on those rocks by allowing the sale of property. The history of how those islands became administered by Japan is also sort of sketchy, so China feels like they got screwed.   The CCP's central stance has traditionally been to right what they see have been the country's wrongs: being humiliated by western powers, creating a powerful united government that wasn't there under the Guomindang (rebel provinces, warlords, invasions by Japan), and of course territorial integrity after roughly a century of everyone carving out chunks of China."

Bear in mind, in this year, the Brits were fighting the Germans/Italians all over the Mediterranean (Malta, Crete, Greece, etc), Middle East (Iraq mostly), North Africa and in the Battle of Britain.   The simple fact of the matter is, if the Brits had been defeated the Soviets never would have received the thousands of planes/trucks that they got from the US nor would the US have had a launching point for invasions of North Africa and Europe.

Yeah, borders and border security are so frigging awesome arresting or shooting Mexicans making a run for it is  super cool ....except when a piece of land outside your own has something you really need (most often oil), then we can put aside the notion of borders and sovereignty until further notice."
worldnews,"No reparations should be required.  The only exception being the Swiss banks that held onto money that was not theirs to retain.   If Japan is still paying reparations, that is absurd.  Additionally, if Japan chooses to rearm, why not?   My only request, is that Japan & the Japanese be honest about the past.  As a Westerner I will always acknowledge that during WW2 the BE allowed millions to starve in India/Pakistan/Bangladesh; that the murder of Japanese POWs was SOP; our failure to bomb the railway to Auschwitz was shameful; and bombing was essentially a war crime.  If politicians try to whitewash history, I would stand up and protest as the Japanese historians did recently.   And as a citizen of a great country, you can be proud of your awesome & honest historians."

worldnews,"While you are getting down votes by people who think you are being alarmist I will answer your question:   Probably not. However this doesn't preclude a future filovirus like Ebola being widely spread via the "air". The Reston virus (an Ebola subtype) was very highly suspected to be passing from monkey to monkey without physical contact when it was first discovered in the 90s. Though in this case the Virus seems to not be pathogenic to humans.   Further evidence has also been found that the pig to non-human primate jump can be made without direct contact for some Ebola subtypes."

worldnews,"Oakland tends to be alright so long as you stay in high traffic areas and don't do anything stupid to make yourself a target.   I disagree somewhat. As always I walked and biked a lot - a LOT - in as many places as possible, I like to explore. The only uncomfortable - but not dangerous! - situation was biking through the parts of Oakland (away from downtown to the south) where all shops have metal-grilled windows. Aside from that - nothing, and I've been to places where shootings do occur. IMHO you are much more likely to become a victim in Brazilian cities, Oakland violence usually is within the group and not often towards outsiders. I also felt perfectly save in the Bronx in 1995: An unmarked police car with police without uniform suddenly stopped next to me and I was surrounded by 4 people. THAT was uncomfortable, until they identified themselves as police. After finding out I was a tourist (at the time, my first 2 month trip through the US) they instructed me to get back to Manhattan because it was too dangerous. I am quite certain even today that it was NOT dangerous - those guys from the police don't know Brazil... well, I  was  getting ready to leave as the sun started to go down, but in Brazil you are not safe at any time.   >  avoid unknown areas.   Never! Well, I avoid Brazil now.   So"
worldnews,"Here to put in my two cents about the topic.  I've studied abroad twice in Brazil and in those 2 years I have gotten robbed three times.   Two of the three times were in broad daylight on a crowded street when I was with a few friends.  We were not speaking english however having a redhead, a blonde girl, and a blonde guy is a dead give away in Rio.  ANyways, so we are walking by and as we are passing smoe people we get two guys that come up to us and one slowly walks with me asking for a dollar or two and if I speak english.  I say no i don't and he gets real close and puts a gun up to my back.  This is all still while walking and fairly ninjalike on his part.  I pulled out my money and tried handing it to him but he said to put it back in my pocket and not to pass it visibly this time.  So, I take it back out and hold it at my side where he takes it, as well as my phone.  And he tells me to keep walking and he walked the other direction.  My friends had the same thing happen to them with a knife essentially.   The second time, was the same guys and this time my friends threw the money on the ground and kept walking.  The robbers, now having peoples eyes on them, tried giving the money back so as to not arouse suspicion but too late, some old Brazilian called them out and they ran away.   The third time, I got my card duplicated.  Not robbed but a huge problem in Brazil still and one that won't go away for the world cup or Olympics.  Seven thousand dollars gone in just three days.. I got it all back thanks to my wonderful credit union being amazingly helpful but its still something I don't want to go through again.   The big thing that is scariest here, is that each time we told the police, nothing was done.  They didn't ask for a description of the guys, they didn't radio it in when we told them, they just stood there and said ok.  We were getting robbed at gun and knife point in broad daylight and the police were of no help.  I do agree that you should not scream if you get robbed but Brazil IS NOT ready for the world cup or the olympics.  It is unsafe and many tourists/soccer fans(especially you german soccer fanatics) won't be nearly as compliant as I was and you will pay for it.   Brazil has made me paranoid about walking alone, as a 6'4" male at 200lbs.  Don't even get me started about having to watch out for being drugged(friends got drugged, mugged, and plugged....yes they were guys...)  Aka, "boa noite cindarella""
worldnews,"Also. Remember that Brazil has the highest taxes for imported goods in the world and less than one percent of high tech industry. This means if your object has eletronics then its very valuable in Brazil, even when its cheap in others places."

worldnews,"No they won't, because customers will never use them again if they do so   Been living under a rock? Snowden exposed how many companies including the big players pass all kinds of data towards the NSA, yet everyone still uses services by these companies.   >You are the type of tin-foil conspiracy theorist that will call every corporation innately evil because, by law, directors' owe a duty to the company and this means making financially sound (as opposed to morally ethical) decisions.   Uh, no. What the fuck. Also, you'll find that "conspiracy theorist" doesn't carry much weight anymore. Everyone who claimed the governments are spying on us were correct. Again, been living under a rock? Ever heard of what Snowden did?   >But part of this 'evil' is the counterbalance that outright selling personal information to the government will lose customers and thus be against the interests of that company.   That depends. If a company makes money by doing so, they do so. Economics 101. If a company can do so without the public knowing about it, they do so. If a company earns more money by selling the data than they lose customers (see above, they barely lose customers), they do so. It takes a twisted mind or one intended to spread propaganda to view it any other way.   >Furthermore, most companies are contractually obliged by their privacy policy not to sell your personal information to an intelligence department and only marketing relevant information is used (e.g. your viewing habits on Youtube).   First of all, my "viewing habits on YouTube" are personal information. "Marketing relevant information" is personal information, especially in the case of targeted advertisements everyone's doing these days. It is a characteristic unique to the individual. But that aside, these "most companies" you refer to have designed their contracts in such a way they can sell it to whom they please and get away with it. That's how it works. That's how it's been going for years, if not ever since the emergence of the Internet. On top of that: You don't need to be a member of any service for the company to collect data on you. See Facebook ghost/shadow profiles.   >If the public got wind of one company that was selling incredibly private information to the Government they would absolutely be fucked - competitors could use it against them in smear campaigns, contracts will be broken and sued upon, faith will be lost in the company, shareholders will get spooked and sell their shares.   Hahahahahahaha- you aren't serious, are you? Have you really been offline for the past 10 years? Sorry, but what you claim is downright false. Companies have been selling your data to other companies, especially advertising companies. Where do you think targeted ads come from?   >So again, I say that I don't give a toss as to whether a company uses marketing information about me and sells that around (within reason).   That's fine. If you don't care about your privacy, that's all up to you.   >I care if you assert they sell it to the Government.   That's strange how you draw the line for yourself there, but okay. If you truly care, you should be enraged by now, but since you seem to be under the illusion that you are a free untracked anonymous person on the Interwebs, I'm afraid you don't realize how wrong you are yet. I say wrong, instead of ignorant or unknowing, because you actively make false claims instead of merely not knowing what's been going on the past decade.   >They might be compelled to get it, but they don't sell it. Yeah I'm uncomfortable about other information companies might have that could get dug up later in my life by individuals, but this law isn't about that so that's off-topic.   Wait- hold the fucking phone. What law? Is there a single law for Government Surveillance? Wow, I thought it was much more deeply rooted than that! Pfew, guess things aren't as bad after all.   Oh wait, that's wrong.   And, last, you are uncomfortable with information companies having details about you that could haunt you later (which, mind you, is part of what the NSA does), but you claim "this law", whatever law you mean by that, isn't about that? While the subject of this thread is mass government surveillance that does exactly what you're uncomfortable with? That genuinely confuses me. Did you try to say something else and did I just misinterpret some sloppy phrases, or do you really not know what you're saying?"
worldnews,"In my analogy I am treating it as a tool that specialized to a particular problem field that can be activated when a relevant problem arises to provide a solution.   Then I misunderstood, my apologies.   > String them together so that they know which other sub-systems they need to communicate with and adding on skill-sets like that you can achieve "equivalent" capability to any particular human via an entity built from a collection of weak AI's   That would be correct. You would then have to ask whether or not multiple networked machines counts as a Strong AI, or if it's still just a network of Weak AI's (or both).   My own opinion is that it would not. Imagine if we designed Weak AI machines to perform every menial task on planet Earth. Every custodial, maintenance, and menial job we can come up with. Does the ability to perform all of those tasks equate to the intelligence of a human? Do those machines that clean houses have the faculty to be truly self aware, able to learn, and be able to reason, imagine, and create the way a human does? No, of course not, ergo I would not necessarily call it a Smart AI as it does not meet or surpass the intellect of a human.   Now, to extrapolate... that's the direction our field is moving. I don't think the pursuit of a single device Strong AI is a worthwhile endeavor, largely because we don't need any single multi-purpose machine. What we need, like you mentioned, is a collection of highly specialized sub machines that can interact and communicate with each other, and are driven together by some master logic.   What I  really  don't think is going to happen is the construction of a machine with an intelligence on par with a human, especially to do something as menial as housework. We don't need a machine that has our brain capacity to do it, pure and simple.   > As for the definitions - weak AI is an extremely fuzzy definition.   Not in my opinion. Weak AI < human intelligence, Strong AI >= human intelligence. On the surface, that's pretty straightforward. The only problem is the definition of human intelligence.   > Strong AI is a theoretical definition as none have yet been produced. It's also relies on fuzzy definitions like "self-awareness", conscience, learning...   I can't disagree. Our own definition of human intelligence is so nebulous that we may create a Strong AI and not even know it. Does human intelligence include the ability to imagine? The ability to be creative? The ability to handle abstract thought?   In short, we don't have that definition written in a way that you or I (as computer scientists) are able to use as field goals.   EDIT: I suppose I should"
worldnews,"Well in that case - strong AI by your definition is not needed.   That said a multi-purpose robot, that encapsulates a few hundred weak AIs with a set of modules and can switch between the higher-tier ones as it switches between high-level tasks like cleaning a room, folding laundry - would sell quite well. Sort of like what [Willow Garage]( are doing.   Overtime such robots might evolve in processing power and complexity of modules to become strong AIs by your definition, at least when it comes to fulfilling requirements.   Things like "learning" is in itself a set of systems of which many we have already reproduced in robots. Learning to move as we do as kids, or when we learn a particular sport - all factory robots now have smarter and smarter calibration algorithms.   Learning information and decision making - expert systems, such as medical diagnostics are all about that (and they learn pretty much the same way human doctors do).   Creativity - we already did music composition. Visual arts are held back by inability to explain what is desired. A machine that generates pictures similar to ones it has found and lets viewers grade beauty to measure it's success would be quite identical to almost all artists.   Self-awareness - that's pretty easy to give to a machine however one defines it. Let it identify itself a set of software that can hook up to the hardware that is it's body. That plus a set definition of purpose and constraints would total self awareness.   Imagination - we already have systems that are able to plan. Take the algorithms used to come up with any plan and start removing/adding/modifying constraints - already you will have a pretty good approximation of "imagination".   I am working with a SCADA control system - could give it limited imagination in the scope of its problem set with a liberal use of randomization functions and a few days of work. It could start "imagining" results of switching various breakers and cutting lines toward a whole bunch of different "goals" (some set of values of its diagnostic metrics) - and it wouldn't be all that different from a controller who stares at the wall half the day and sometimes imagines how make the city lights spell out words to planes passing by... I mean obviously our SCADA system doesn't have a concept of visual look of the city to the human eye... but hypothetically I could give it one if for example I told it to look up lyric's to a song on the web, and than pass images of how the city power map would look like in a given configuration of breakers. And pass those images through a captcha system until it starts getting better match results to the words of lyrics..."

Additionally, the Soviet Union under Stalin is vastly different than the Russian Federation. You can't compare the two, or attribute those deaths to any modern policies.   Deaths in China from the Great Leap forward or governmental transition are entirely irrelevant. The link you gave me doesn't differentiate and is to a book which I can't read because the whole book is not on that website, so you need to cite specific instance where China has invaded other countries, and not instances where they defended themselves and aided popular reform movements.   You don't even need proper sources, just tell me specific instances from memory and I will look them up."
worldnews,"My source is after the coldwar and it is an edu source. You saying it doesnt count doesnt make it so. By all means you are free to disprove it using sources, but you saying, "Your source proves me wrong so it doesnt count because I said so," doesnt work friend.   Your source doesnt count because I said so. See how stupid that sounds?   Your source doesnt  even support your claim.Your source is not saying the US is responsible for those deaths. It is saying the US supported those regimes. And in most of those cases the USSR, and sometimes CHina was just as involved. So what you are doing is misrepresenting your source to make a claim it never made, nor does it support. Furthermore you are ignoring the role Russia, and sometimes, played in all of these events in your source. So in addition to 100+ million they killed they are to blame with the US in all of those instances which further proves my point.   You can say that 100 million murders is irrelevant. 99% of the world will disagree with you but taht is your opinion. You need to learn history.   My academic source is also much stronger than your source, which btw doesnt even support your argument. You just misrepresented your source.   I didnt add your numbers up but ill take your argument of 10 million. Since Russia and China have equal responsibility we can those to their kill count. So here is where we stand.   Russia: 110 million China: 110 MILLION (although 20-30 million could be deducted before Russia helped overthrow their government) US: 10 million (in response to Russia and China)   I rest my case."

But by no means did they turn the tide of the war.   I recall hearing a story somewhere that some documents were found regarding the Normandy invasion, and that the reason for the storm was different, that Western allies were concerned about the progress of the Soviet Union. Apparently they did not want USSR to completely reach the coast of France, so the US, Canada, and other smaller nations set out to this epic invasion to make sure the Soviets  cannot take Europe whole. They had that motive but wore  the "making Germany fight a war on two (technically three if you count Africa) fronts" mask."

worldnews,"And the Occupy Central movement is starting to lose momentum. So far, the Chinese central government and the Hong Kong government have done pratically nothing.   The original hope was that Golden Week (1 week vacation following National Day on Oct 1st), the rest of the Hong Kong population would rise up with them. But as it turns out, Golden Week is a popular shopping time in Hong Kong equivalent of Christmas season. For some buisnesses, this week accounts for a great chunk (~20%) their annual profit. There was an interview with a struggling new-restaurant owner that already lost 300k in inventory spoilage and began laying off staff. People have bills to pay and mouths to feed. The majority working population is hit hard while the people protesting were getting their lives paid for them.   Then there's the lack of support. Hong Kong hasn't changed since China took over. Even under British rule, there was no democracy. The Hong Kong's older generation built the city into the world 3rd biggest financial center that it is today and the protest is destroying it. Most people know that the protest is futile and if anything, it's making the situation worse. However, anti-OccupyCentral doesn't mean anti-Democracy. It would have been better for them to stop a few days earlier where they got the message across without the angry mob.   Despite the censorship, people on mainland do know about this protest, and they believe that Hong Kongers are being "snobs." China already treats Hong Kong very well, but this demand is way over the top. Mainlanders already dislike Hong Kongers for stereotyping them as uncivilized and treating them like dirt. There are always pro-democracy and pro-goverment post on Chinese forums, especially when Taiwan is involved, but this time it's rather anti-Hong Kong. So there's no support from a good chunk of people in Hong Kong, there's no support from Mainland China, and the Hong Kong and China goverments aren't budging.   Lastly there's international support. Unless the goverments acts on it, international support is worthless. I'm not saying that the media is biased, but things will always get over-reported for popularity (or in case the goverment does eventually act on it.)

The stupidity of these protests stem from the fact that the POINT of it is TO cause as much disruption as possible. Only when locals started getting pissed en masse did they feign "sympathy" in the form of saying they'll help reduce inconveniences yet remaining in the same spots.     The police used tear gas to disperse them when they rushed government barriers repeatedly early in the protests, no one was killed or seriously injured, I fail to see "police brutality".     One example, the "Fei Li" incident. The movement put out a heavily editted video of a guy running into a barricade and colliding with female protesters, and then the female protesters started yelling "FEI LI" aka "sexual harassment", then the dude got stomped on.       The full video got posted later, the guy was a business owner who needed to pay 145 K USD per month per restaurant for his three restos that are in the occupied area, and he has basically gone bankrupt because they virtually stopped businesses from coming through to his shops during the busiest week of the year.   Other examples, just go on yellow ribbon movement fbs, anyone that voices disagreements get instantly jumped on by a bunch of assholes with yellow ribbon profile pics who diss the guy for "only know about money" and "paid shills". It's all over the place, the tone is generally "anyone who doesn't support us are either money slaves or Chinese govt spies".   My friends' parents generation in HK pretty much all think these students are idiots. His hair dresser went to the protests because of the earlier mentioned crying wolf about the cops brutalizing them, he's since resumed his job as a hair dresser because the cops were being extremely civilized throughout the whole thing barring minor incidents.

Now, before I get reamed for anti-American sentiment, bare with me. Part of the allure of Cuba is the more laid back tourist base and the resulting environment, and this in part comes from the minimal volume due to the restrictions on Americans traveling there. Not to say that Canadians can't be wild, uncontrollable and disgustingly confrontational; they can be. But because of the minimal tourist base, it doesn't hold the same reputation as "Party Central", and henceforth, all the "just turned 18 so let's get stewed and fuck shit up without fear of consequence because I'm outside my local jurisdiction" crowd tend to travel to other areas. Which makes traveling to Cuba more enjoyable.   Also, the country is among the safest, if not the safest, for tourists. Every citizen in that country understands the importance of the tourist industry, and go out of their way to ensure your safety. I feel safer in the slums of Havana or Holguin, than I do in parts of Ottawa.   The food, however, is sub-par. And this, of course, is a result of the embargo and the inability to get quality food from a neighbour that rests 80 KM to the north."

Here is some more context about the TPP -   >What we do know from leaked documents is that this agreement is not about trade, but rather about expanding the rights of Big Media conglomerates who are pushing for extreme Internet censorship powers.   >Consequences of this heavy-handedness range from criminalizing small-scale alleged copyright infringement, like uploading a home video with a popular song playing in the background, to blocking web content, and even quite literally kicking people -- and entire families -- off the web simply for being accused of breaking copyright rules, without any evidence or due process.

Than again, I do not want to be accountable for these losers, they should pay for this, but they're probably on wellfare, so the Dutch tax-payer will pay the bill, which pisses me off."

You can't really just assume since there wasn't much of a response that everyone does/would agree with your point of view.   Analogy time.  Let's say we have a country where 75% of the population supports keeping the owning of sharks illegal.  And the government passes a bill saying that they are going to keep owning sharks illegal.  0.2% of the population (that would be the same as 100,000 Canadians compared to their entire population) decides to protest this bill.  One of these Canadians is in support of this bill.  So he goes onto a website and says:   > Lackluster response to criminal bill: Average Canadian apathetic and uninformed at best.

I was told by my customer (a U.S. Company with Canadian offices) that this was common, so I came prepared with documentation from the company who was my customer as well as the on-site Canadian contact.  Even then I was told to sit and wait until everyone else was processed, and it still took over an hour for them to let me go.  It wasn't really fair to give me such grief, but they were just doing their job.   It looks like this woman's only mistake was not telling US Customs that she was there as a tourist, which would not have been a lie IMHO."

In fact, I was not receiving room and board, and had to pay those expenses out of pocket, and still had to spend several hours in U.S. Immigration trying to convince the (very nice and polite) border guard that I wasn't being paid or compensated in any way, except for a grade for completing an internship course at my Canadian university. I did try to do my research, but this situation wasn't 'volunteering' and it wasn't 'work', so I just drove to the border and sorted it out there. In the end, it was a printout of my bank balance that convinced him to let me in, something I included in my papers as an afterthought!"
worldnews,"A few years ago I read a fascinating book* written by a soldier in the U.K. army, who served in Iraq for 2-3 years during and after the invasion. He was actually a territorial (part-time) soldier and his real job at home was working for some big bank in the city of London.   When the British took control of Basra in the south, he was asked to take care of the finances for running the government. With the removal of the Sadam regime there was no one to pay anyone who ran the infrastructure- roads, sewage, police, that kind of thing. This soon became a very important job since the soldiers had to win the hearts and minds of the local population.   The writer also had another problem: the Americans had automatically fired anyone who had links with the Baath party and told them to go home; big mistake, as he found out that for some jobs (teachers was the first example) you HAD to be a party member, and all the Americans had managed to do was fire all the university educated level staff - so the first task was to get them back again.   The next task was to pay them - and on time. For the first few months this meant repeated requests to the U.S. command (due to his new job, the soldier now reported direct to the military in Baghdad) for actual money to pay everybody (and, actually finding out what that pay was because the locals all tried to get him to pay out more than he should).   But now to the crux of our story. One day, a large shipping container arrived at his office, and he was asked to sign for the contents. Having done so, the container was opened and found to reveal - millions of bundled U.S. dollars. Since money from the Americans always required a metric ton of paperwork, the author was a mite confused as to why an unrequested whole-fucking-shipping-container of cash should just show up. A quick phone call, and the answer from U.S. high command:   "The money sent to you is Iraqi money frozen in U.S. banks in the 90's. Since this money is Iraqi money, and you are giving it to Iraqi people, the U.S. army only needs to make sure it arrived, and not to check how it is spent."   The author was not happy with the situation - but it may account for a good chunk of that $8.7B"
worldnews,"This link]( describes the composition of red mud fairly well.   Bauxite, a rock formed of various forms of AlOOH and other random oxyhydroxide minerals, is processed to make alumina (Al2O3) by digesting the ore in caustic soda or lye (NaOH). At pH 15 or so at elevated temperatures and pressures the aluminum bearing minerals dissolve, putting the aluminum in solution and leaving things like iron, titanium, and silicon oxides in the solid phase. The valuable solution is separated from the solids using a process called counter current decantation. The solids are then washed to recover as much of the NaOH and Al bearing solution as possible. These washed solids are the red mud that got spilled.   Thus, there are two major toxic aspects of red mud, and one minor. First is the extreme alkalinity. Even after fairly thorough washing to recover NaOH, the stuff is still pH 13 or so. This is more than alkaline enough to cause severe chemical burns.   The second major toxic aspect are the random heavy metals that are insoluble in the Bayer liquor (the pH 15 stuff I mentioned earlier that does the digestion). This includes things like lead, cadmium, and whatever else was in the ore body. I don't know what was in the specific ore the Hungarian plant treated. Minor constituents of bauxites can be just about anything. The main one I've seen mentioned in news articles has been lead.   The minor toxic aspect of red mud is radioactivity. I should preface this paragraph by saying I am by no means an expert on radiation or radioactivity or its affect on human health, so there is probably a lot of nuance I am missing. However, bauxite ores do contain some fraction of radioisotopes, and these radioisotopes tend to end up in the red mud fraction, not in the solution. This varies strongly by the ore characteristics, but in a study of Australian bauxites, the radioactivity of the red mud was approximately 5-10x higher than the original bauxite. This begs the question - how radioactive is the original bauxite, and is it dangerous? 5-10x bugger all is still bugger all. According to [this Australian study]( red mud is classified as low radioactive activity. In my non expert opinion I would guess that the radioactivity is a far distant 3rd to the two chief problems of high alkalinity and heavy metal toxicity.   To answer a question you had elsewhere, it is doubtful that there are any organic solvents involved. The bayer process is almost entirely an exercise in inorganic chemistry. There are the odd organic additives used in bayer processing to help deal with scale, but these are only present in the ppm range in the undiluted liquor. I can't imagine them being higher than the parts per billion level in the washed slurry."
worldnews,"To be perfectly honest the Chinese have the equivalent of Facebook and Twitter. The only reason they ban facebook and twitter is because of CIA's freepass to the data and using it as a device to spam / draw Chinese netizens' attention with free Tibet / freedom of speech info. After that, they released a Chinese version of Twitter and FB (the twitter also has a 140character limit, i believe) where the central government can also moniter the data and private info its users put onto their "fb/twitter", and also remove unwanted contents (this is also done by fb, but at a much less extent)."

The situation has been boiling for years but now is the time to make a difference in that country.   The same can be said for Bahrain, which has just been given a F1 Grand Prix for later in the year.

sociology,"If you're looking for usefulness, may I suggest that you either minor in Computer Science/Digital Humanities or in Statistics alongside Sociology?   Sociology uses quite a bit of statistics for it's quantitative research.   Digital Humanities (DH) partly teaches you how to visualize data, as well as to collect data.   Computer Science (CS) would also be helpful as it would give you a background in programming, which is also extremely useful. My professor/supervisor wishes she had a CS background. It's the difference between using tools to study Sociology and making the tools to study Sociology.   DH/CS would also be useful for history; I know Masters students at Western who use DH."

It's a fun thing to know, and it'll probably bring you joy next time you go to your significant other or a person you aim to date, and you can say "hey, I can tell that he/she/it likes me!"

mlb,"The trouble is that the MLB watched the Steroid Era unfold and made tons of money and Selig loved it. Then he went, "ya know what? This might not be a good idea." So he went all Old Testament on their asses. He fucked over the guys who turned the sport around and thrust it back into the spotlight; all while Selig turned a blind eye. Selig needs to stop acting  like these guys are the most awful people to ever play the game. Yes, A Rod and Braun are egotistical assholes who think they are untouchable, but are they worse than the other HOF egotistical  uassholes who think they are untouchable? I don't think that Braun and A Rod should get crucified because Selig changed his tune recently and hung them out to dry. Anyone who gets caught after the Biogenesis case though is on their own have no defense whatsoever. Right now though? Bud Selig is to blame for this batch of steroid users. He enabled them and they made him a ton of money, as they got huge salaries as well. It is horseshit that he changes his tune all of the sudden."

I've always assumed this was her saying "we don't care what you think is cool; we do our own thing, and to us, it's just as cool. In our own minds ("in our dreams"), we're just as cool as if we were driving Cadillacs."   That makes no sense.  "Cadillacs" are exactly something that belongs in the previous lies (gold teeth, grey goose).

THEN she says "we crave a different kind of buzz." Then she describes that "buzz"   She describes that buzz to be exactly the thing she just talked about (being royalty/ruler/queen bee).    If anything Queen Bee might be a Beyonce reference, saying SHE WANT TO BE LIKE BEYONCE or other royalty/ruler (literally synonyms)   > I assume this is meant in some sort of romantic way, not in the sense that she actually wants to boss people around, especially considering she just spent a stanza describing how that stuff doesnt matter to her),   OR its just poorly written OR it's actually about DESIRING THAT stuff.  It makes no sense.   > It seems like what she's saying is that her and her friends have figured out what makes them happy; she's asking for the mainstream/media/music industry/whatever to leave them alone and let them do what they like (i.e. "Let me live that fantasy")   That is obvious bullshit.  "Let me live that fantasy" refers to the fantasy of being famous.    She even says she is NOT proud of her address.  She envies their shit for half the song and talks shit for the other half."

puppy101,"I take my pup to day care and it has been a godsend. He goes about twice a week.  They alternate between free play and crate time. When he gets home he is soo tired he naps the rest of the day.  I imagine he is still tired the next day, because he is generally pretty chill, even when I have to crate him (both hubster and I work full time).  He gets so excited when the dog bus comes that he starts crying and runs right onto the bus and onto his seat.  My puppy is about 5 months old.   Like others have said, it depends on the specific place. The person who runs this day is amazing and can perfectly replicate dog noises.  On the first day,Rocko (my pup) barked a lot in the kennel. But Jill did dog noises at him (growling/scolding) and by day 2 he wasn't barking AT ALL!  She sends me picture and video texts throughout the day as well.   Then again, I used to take Rocko to the dog park 2-3 days a week (now down to once a week) so he had a lot of experience playing with other dogs and he went to puppy school."

It remains to see if it will beat out Nullpomino for my Hardcore tetris fix or Tetrisfriends for when I come home drunk and just want to tspin suckas.   Edit: OH GOD!

vaporents,"I'll re-post this, it's what I posted to /r/mflb about my experiences with my mflb in the dorms from my freshman year.  >It really depends on the room and the amount of air flow. Three examples. 1. Sitting at home in my basement. Pretty substantial size room with sliding door open. Brother comes down 5 minutes after smoking, smells nothing. 2. Dorm vaping with window open and fan blowing out with ac on. Roommate comes in while putting away stuff ~2 minutes after and he can smell it. 3. Dorm with 2 fans on vaping (one blowing out into window, other in the middle of the room blowing towards window) and friend who doesnt smoke cant smell anything. 2+3 Both while exhaling into the window. Be careful and buy some febreze.   The only thing I would say now is that a sploof definitely helps and you don't need to blow into the window if you use one. In my experience it wasn't the mflb that really caused the smell but the dank itself when I opened the bag."
vaporents,"Ok I think I know what you mean but I don't think you worded it perfectly.  As far as I can tell you want something that heats up quickly but you don't have to control (controlled by the vape not the user) and something you can take a cheeky (nandos (if you're a brit you'll get this, if not ignore it (only adding this in because it's a rare site to have 3 nested parethesis))) hit off of when someones back is turned.   Sadly I think the MFLB is as close as you can get to this, I have seen people recommending the Alfa which I've sadly never tried but has a small following of people who love it, another vape I have tried and would openly suggest is the Flowermate V5.0s/Mini.  Ok, it takes a while to heat up (35-45 seconds) and it really is more of a session vape (10 mins) so it doesn't fit your criteria but maybe (just maybe (I love brackets ([9]))) it would fulfil your home vaping side, leaving the MFLB perfect for out and about?  It's just a suggestion of course, really only you know what you mean I'm just trying to be helpful :D"

AirForce,"Okay, so a commander is doing his final flight before he retires. He gets to his jet (B-52) and is starting up. He get's his engines running and one of his hydraulic pumps just completely shits out and stops working. We (Hydraulics) get to the plane and carefully troubleshoot the situation. "Shit's broke". He requests taking a spare, but he's not allowed to because he's not flying an actual mission, and we had training crews flying that day too that might need the spare for more important reasons than a finny flight. He decides that he'll wait until the pump is changed and sits quietly in the 100+ F weather which is about 20-30 F hotter in the cockpit of a B-52 for an hour while we change the pump. We change out the pump finally and he gets engines running again. The pump runs just fine for a few minutes then shits out as well... You can imagine that at this point the commander is pretty pissed. He requests a spare and is denied again. We start taking off the second pump. I look over while we're changing the pump and I see a group of crew chieves sprinting across the flightline. I then notice that the crew had gotten out of the plane and were walking to the spare.   Turns out, the commander called some brass a little higher than him and probably a little higher than our production for a favor. They told him to take the spare, and he walked to the spare without telling our production. The crew chieves were for the spare and thought that they were good to go help others on their jets, so they had to get to their jet as fast as possible and ended up sprinting across the flightline to meet the crew there."
needadvice,"So I'm reminded of Neil DeGrasse Tyson regarding people who claim to have been abducted by aliens, he just said to bring something back - like a new alien technology as proof.  So if you are a professional surfer, you should have some pictures of you with your sponsors.   The other thing I would do is just tone it down on the stuff that people may not believe. So if you dated a b-list celeb, then just say his/her first name and emphasize why this person was crazy or why it didn't work out. People are interested in failure more than success.   Emphasize stories vs a brag list. Instead of "I was once a professional surfer" say "I tried surfing once and was pretty decent at it so I thought I would enter the 'Big Kahuna' contest. I was super nervous, yada yada yada, and that's when a rogue wave took my swim trunks right off with everyone watching." The more details the more believable.   Lastly I wouldn't not talk about who you are. I think the disbelief comes from people being more interested in themselves, and also wondering why a person with such an remarkable life would be hanging out with them."

TTC30,"Related to fitness but on a different note - I'm a long-distance runner and swimmer, and I was pretty competitive on the amateur circuit amid the select group of oddball events I competed in. I used to swim 5K to 10K distance races and run up to 50-mile races. I lifted as well but just for cross training, not the serious stuff you ladies are discussing. Yes, I know my activity level was extreme; I've heard every comment imaginable from outsiders. But I have never had missed or lightened periods as a result. And yes, I backed off while TTC. But all the while, my own subconscious pressure that I "should be" relaxing or taking it easier or whatever has been killing me the last couple years. At first, backing off meant running "only" 10 miles and swimming only a mile at a time. Then I backed off much more drastically, just light 2-3 mile jogs and light lifting 2-3 x/week for about 7-8 months. I also cut out alcohol entirely for a couple months (I'm a daily beer drinker, not heavy, but 1 or 2 per day and my doc advised quitting). I have never in my life been pregnant, and those measures did nothing to change that. Now, having passed the 2-year mark at TTC I'm frustrated at lack of any results and I'm starting to say F it, and ramp back up my training a bit. I'm back to doing 10-milers and speed work. Not sure where I will go from here but I might even include a fall marathon or longish trail race. Mid 30s is the prime of athletic life for an amateur endurance athlete like myself, and the way I see it, one lifelong dream of parenthood is already slipping away, so it's tough to see the another one close to my heart get dragged down with it."
laptops,"As per the rules from the sidebar...   "Genuinely try to help someone who is looking for a new laptop rather than throwing down the first thing that comes to mind"   If someone comes here asking for a laptop to run a mission critical server for a startup that is going to see 100,000s users, it is disingenuous to recommend a laptop when they clearly need a server.   OP wants a gaming laptop.  My advice is not to get a laptop for gaming (unless you just want to play flashgames), as it is too expensive for what you get, and since OP is a student, my advice likely aligns with OPs budget.

DestructionPorn,"They're pellets for a pellet gun.  I had one a long time ago that came with two barrels, one for .177 pellets like this, one for .22 rounds.   They're great for target practice (especially for younger people who aren't quite ready for "real" guns), they can take out squirrels and rats super easy with way less mess than a bullet, and the ammunition is unbelievably cheap (about $20 for over 1000 of the regular ones, these polymer tips are much more expensive at about 10 bucks for 100 or so) and plentiful, whereas .22 can be impossible to find in some areas.  The guns are also nearly silent and can be legally fired in almost any area, even inside city limits, and without a permit.  They're also incredibly easy to maintain, with even less moving parts than a regular gun, but offer almost the same amount of customization and choice as the real thing.  The polymer tip is just to help the pellet fly straighter and it gets pushed into the center of the round when it impacts, forcing the round to expand even more than usual since they are made of very soft metal."
Bravenewbies,"i dont see the problem with splinter corps being more common in an alliance like Brave, the dropbears are as much BNI as any other BNI member, pretty much all BNI ops are open to the whole of Brave, the only difference between being in BNI and any splinter corp is that you will most likely feel more familiar with the splinter corp, BNI is nice but it is not ideal, it is quite easy to feel like just one of the sheep because people come and go so fast it is hard to get to know people.   my suggestion is to maybe encourage the idea of splinter corps, leave BNI as a newbie seed corp or whatever but encourage people to join smaller groups that work tightly together, when i see our sub channels on mumble and see 15 people in bovril or dropbears i become happy because they obviously like playing together and whenever they join Brave ops they represent their part of Brave quite nicely.   there is another strategic aspect for splitting up more evenly, now that we have a chunk of our own space it would be silly to put all eggs in one basket, have people spread out into groups, create their own little minihubs for whatever they like doing, V-3 could still be a central BNI/Brave staging HQ but there is no need for subgroups to stick there. also when we eventually get invaded not all of our newbie assets are locked up in an area and the more we spread out our operations the softer the blow is for Brave as a whole, and it gives people time to evacuate, instead of having 500bil of noob assets in one station."
Bravenewbies,"Local production as a means of augmenting importation is not the same as supplying a market solely through local means. You are right that profit potential does exist in most areas, however... my point was not with regards to small scale industry, but instead from an alliance industry management perspective. If they were to try to replace  all  alliance rigs with locally produced materials, it just wouldn't work. There isn't enough supply to cover all needs, and the demand for many of the materials produced from exploration and salvage just wouldn't be high enough. Import/export will always be a huge portion of a healthy economy.   Though I did say this in another comment: Arbitration is not the same as comparing the cost of importing goods vs local production. You would need to compare the cost of producing goods in highsec vs locally, and then subtract the freight costs per volume from the highsec goods to get a true comparison. Obviously selling in null is almost always more profitable, but producing in null often not, especially with low volume goods. Local production requires more time than importing, and leaves you more vulnerable to market shifts.   The best solution will always be a mix of local production and importation. Local producers often are not the primary force keeping the market well stocked, but they significantly improve the stability of prices. This comes down to their very nature: Importers can quickly switch to products with higher profit margins, while local producers have production cycles to work with, and often have products coming out regularly as they attempt to control their niche."
Bravenewbies,"Easily the end of the winter war with Usurper.  After months of pitched battle, we'd ground their assets down to a POS in [KLYN-8](  The final timer was on the weekend, so I decided it'd be fun to alarm clock for once.   I logged in around three or four in the morning to see everyone in fleet.  When I say "everyone", I mean  [everyone](  And by "fleet", I mean the second or third overflow fleet.  We'd formed a friendly relationship with GEEMU, at the time one of the largest independent newbie corps in Eve, so  they* were blue for the fight too.   We had absolute numerical supremacy, but Usurper. and their allies, Psychotic Tendencies. (TISHU), were making their final stand in capitals, so we prepared for a lengthy fight with high losses.  And then the battle was over as it barely started.   It turns out Usurper. had helped another group bash some of TISHU's assets a few days earlier, after TISHU had taken care to  not  hit Usurper. structures as they became vulnerable.   TISHU took umbrage to this, and in the words of one of their pilots, ["devised a plan worthy of the title Admiral Awox"](  In short, TISHU switched sides the moment Usurper. was engaged in combat, and the combined fire from BRAVE and TISHU instantly vaporized Usurper's capital fleet."
Bravenewbies,"Quite a difficult one. For me it's impossible to pin down a 'BRAVE moment', I cherish so many memories form my time in Brave. Although it's interesting to see how what you appreciate as a player evolves over time.   My most endearing memories of Rahadalon are newbie to the core. Getting on my first killmail with a Merlin, seeing my first titan (a PL Avatar) in Nakah, Kill: Motre (Revelation),  Asking if it's worth fitting guns to suicide tackle , going into a WH for the first time and having Andrew Jester lose half the fleet, 'need people on the Mendori gate there's freighter coming through', the RvB war, helping found Brave dojo with Hail Sagan, getting my first T2 ship - a hound - for ratting battleships in curse... the list is endless. These are not things I would wish to repeat, but I enjoyed greatly at the time.   In Barleguet I feel that I actually 'learned how to play', with most experiences being something I can relate to today.  The endless POS bashing with LePetite ]( discovering the joys of POS reactions with some friends, joining my first social channels (most of which I'm still in today), calling 'Blue ICe is primary' whilst FCing an anti-leadership fleet on Kennick sun, lighting a cyno so that we could kill SNUFF dreads that dropped on NOC's carrier camp, flying an unkillable Scorpion in Megaladon fleets that [still has a top place on my killboard years later]( [getting my first capital ship]( becoming 'space middle class' [via DED sites]( and starting to PLEX my accounts for the first time... Again, not things I would necessarily like to repeat, but are fond memories nonetheless.   Sendaya/Catch was different. Aside from the [extremely fun deployment speculation]( I went in smugly ahead of everyone else, personally deploying with a few cap pilots in suitcase carriers half a day before the announcement was made. Which pretty much defined my Catch experience in a nushell. For the first time I was 'at the top' of the corp in terms of experience and SP, newbie frigates roams didn't interest me, they exasperated me. That's not to say Catch wasn't fun, I just felt that the majority of Brave 'ideals' were conflicting with my own. [Skynetting inties in V-3]( [Watching the hilarious conclusion to Fanfest '14 together on comms]( dropping for the first time with Brave caps to help set timers, almost losing my archon as Levi Scutter forgets to bring warp core stabs in his Nid, [becoming the alliance mogul on DED sites]( [enjoying Brave first T2 cruiser fleets]( having some of the most fun I've had in Eve piloting an Onyx in said fleets, etc etc.   Of course, [Catch is where I left Brave]( for the reasons I put in that post. I'll always enjoy helping people in Brave Dojo and chatting to friends made during my time in corp, but I just feel that Brave as an alliance is no longer for me.   Also fuck that got preachy. Sorry."
preppers,"What does your family eat NOW?  What is your normal meal plan for an average month?  Use your current menu plan / eating habits as the base for your food storage, and just expand on what you would normally buy.   For instance, if you normally eat spaghetti and tomato sauce once a week, get the ingredients for four extra meals of spaghetti and tomato sauce (ie. dry pasta, canned tomato sauce, spices).  If you eat chili often, get extra beans and tomato sauce and such.  Even if parts of the 'normal' meal aren't storage-friendly (say, ground beef, or fresh bell peppers), you could make substitutions (a can of salsa in a pot of chili does wonders in making up for a lack of fresh peppers and onions), and at least you have some base ingredients on hand.   If your current menu is not very storage-friendly, maybe try introducing a new meal every couple of weeks to see what your family actually likes, before going out and buying a lot of food.  Or, try adjusting one of your usual recipes to use only pantry items (like the chili example above).  The bonus to this is that you will always have a quick meal on hand (I find anything that is based on canned food is usually super-fast to throw together, and you never have to run to the store).   Personally, I think the LDS recommendations are not very useful to most people, as there are very few families that would be able to cook something tasty from wheat, sugar, peanut butter, and cooking oil; however, a much larger group would be able to make a tasty meal with canned beans, tomato sauce, and spices, or with applesauce, oatmeal, and sugar."
Naruto,"First of all, you can't say "full strength" Itachi, because that would be basing your argument off something we've never seen and only assumed. That's like saying Hiruzen would steam roll everyone in his prime because he was the "God of Shinobi". There is a good chance he would, but without any evidence to base an argument on, it would be pointless. > I don't think Sauske has evolved that much since their fight.   I don't say this often, but are you retarded? He has a much better version of Amaterasu, being able to mold it into it's perfect form, the same Susanoo as Itachi, EMS which would allow him to use said abilities much more often than Itachi, and improved eyesight. Itachi "showed his prowess" against Kabuto, but because he had an immortal body and unlimited chakra. He got cut in half multiple times. His one saving grace is his Izanami, but since that costs him an eye, I doubt he'd use it."
Naruto,"I can't believe someone actually has any doubts of how its going to end,  it's Naruto guys , we all know Naruto is going to get some ultimate power out of someone's ass and face Madara. He'll fail ofc and madara will give his final bad guy speech , then wen all hope seems lost Naruto will stand up and use the power of friendship and willpower to wreck Madara's face , then everyone lives happily everafter :p"
Volkswagen,"I looked into polish that could work on glass before. Turns out that glass is made of silicone (mostly) and in its hardened state it is near the top of the Mohs hardness scale, and the only thing you can use to polish glass is very expensive and horribly toxic to humans."
leafs,"So many problems with the buds, let's get started   Fucking Paul Ranger is the worst defencemen since Komisarek. The guy leaves the NHL because he was "over it" then comes back because he runs out of money no doubt. I get why signing him was a good choice monetarily.. However his play makes me think he should be flipping burgers or selling cars.   Fraser is OK. He's a great AHL D man, but he cannot move fast enough at the NHL level to keep up with the faster talent on the ice, not to mention he really doesn't have enough of a hockey IQ to make smart decisions to render his cinder blocks less useless"   Not to mention these are established players that, at the sacrifice of sitting our best defensive prospect in Reilly, they continue to torpedo efforts to get better as a team.   Phaneuf is a great 2nd D, but he is by no means "the man" nor does he deserve to be the captain of the leafs. NOBODY on the current team deserves to be.. Except maybe Bolland.  Lest we forget it was phaneuf who cost us the playoffs as well as a chance at winning against Pittsburgh the other night. And the leafs have the most empty net goals against... Phaneuf is on the ice for those "big moments", regardless of +/- The shithawk only allows key goals against.   Now on to the goalies.   Reimer is routinely hung out to dry, and really isn't prone to shitty goals against. He should be starter until Bernier takes it from him. The fact the leafs essentially gave the starting job to a goalie who's never played 3 games in a row before this year is fucking rediculous. Reimer's composure, outlook, and work ethic are amazing, he is the eptiome of a professional. His technique is unique and it works with him, and I am glad to see that Francois Allaire left as his system is too complicated, antiquated, cerebral for the new age reactionary goalies. Ain't nobody got time to remember 12 zones anymore.  As a fellow trendy, I find we get lit up most WHEN we think too much.   That being said,  I think Bernier is the future for the leafs in the next couple years IF he gets his composure, work ethic, and save selection to the NHL level.  In his last couple starts, he's been getting shelled for really no reason as there have been a lot of goals that go under him or through him (which are the ONLY goals that are a goalie's fault 100% of the time)  Bern's needs some reps at the NHL level in order to get better, but since the emergence of Martin Jones for the kings, I really think the kings were cutting "dead wood" off the tree and super scored with Ben Scrivvens.  If Bernier went undefeated every time he had a start( as Jones has), he would have become the starter over Jon Quick right?"
leafs,"If you have a link for this, that'd be great.   Everytime I see a thread about how the Leafs will do this year, or whether person X leaving/joining is better for us (and etc.), I really think that for most part:  It doesn't matter .   The horrible system we played last year would make most teams suffer and unless we're willing to change it, we will continue to suffer."
leafs,"I'm actually about ready to break, but it's for a different reason.   Rogers has screwed me for the last time. I just learned about an 'unpaid bill' on my credit report from 2011. The bill had, in fact, been paid as soon as I found out it went to collections. I had moved, asked them for the final bill, which I paid over the phone with my credit card right on the spot. For some reason, there was another ~$200 missing, and they only tracked me down through a collection agency. Well, i paid the collection agency after some arguing with rogers (never actually figured out what the bill was for, but couldn't be fucked to argue anymore). 3 years later, I'm applying for my mortgage, and look who never reported that I paid the bill to the credit bureau! Now it looks like I have had an unpaid bill on my account for 3 years, and, you guessed it, my mortgage was denied. 35% down payment, 6 figure income. Now that is has been straightened out, it still shows up on my credit report as a bill that went unpaid for four years. No mortgage for you."
TheMentalist,"Well there are a ton of "it's impossible" moments in the show. However, those same moments existed in Fight Club, yet they pulled it off. Example, When Brad Pitt pulls in the government official trying to wage war on the members of fight club, Edward Norton locks the door. Now if Tyler Durden was dragging the man in first, he couldn't also be the last one in and lock the door.   Therefore, my biggest argument against the Jane theory is the following:   After Jane's family was murdered, he had a mental breakdown. He lost his will to live and was admitted to a psychiatric facility for a year, and he was not allowed to leave (Jane says this when describing his relationship with his psychiatrist, the room was locked, i.e. he wasn't allowed to leave). Thus, we conclude he was under constant surveillance with almost no privacy by psychiatrists.   And now a little background on Dissociative Identity Disorder (commonly known as multiple personality disorder): Dissociation is when a person loses track of time and/or person, and instead finds another representation of their self in order to continue in the moment. A person who dissociates often loses track of time or themselves and their usual thought processes and memories. People who have a history of any kind of childhood abuse often suffer from some form of dissociation.) source:   In a way it's kind of like pretending to be someone else, someone stronger than you, someone who can deal with the trauma you are experiencing, or someone who cannot recognize the trauma. I.e. you could become a giant body builder if you are being picked on by bullies or a blind woman if you witnessed a traumatic murder.   DID occurs when the person immerses themselves so fully into dissociation that they believe they are someone else when they dissociate.   So we would be operating under the idea that Jane has DID (an alternate identity named Red John). Now I'll spell out why I think that's complete nonsense and shouldn't be considered a viable theory.   1 - Jane was under constant mandatory psychiatric evaluation by professionals who would recognize DID.   2 - The murder of Jane's family must be the most traumatic event he's ever experienced, so if he dissociated as a common response to stress, he would most definitely dissociate in response to his family's murder. This means that the psychiatrists would have observed him turn into Red John.   3 - Further substantiating that argument that the psychiatrists would have noticed the potential for DID in Jane, Jane draws the Red John smiley while in the psych ward and stares at it.   Anyone who makes the argument that Jane is Red John needs to do several things to make their theory believable.   A - They need to show some reason for Jane to dissociate and kill his family. Our alternate identities are there to help us cope, not destroy our lives. Why would Red John turn on the man he's supposed to protect? Plus, where's the evidence that Jane is one who dissociates in the first place?   B - They need to create an explanation to show us how the psychiatrists never noticed a dissociative pattern in Jane when he experienced the greatest trauma of his life when they had a year to observe him under that stress.   B seems, at least to me, to be an impossible feat."
NoFap,"its pretty much the perfect"
NoFap,"I would defiantly suggest keeping it up. If you are already experience ED issues they will only get worse. Secondly, speaking as one who had the same problems starting out, it helps a lot to channel that drive into something more productive. Go work out, join a club at your school, study harder, hell read the news and educate yourself. Pick any of about a million actives you could do instead of fapping i guarantee they are more productive and better use of your time. I'm 24 not that much older but in a short 5 years i went from fapping daily for a short period to wasting hours and hours watching porn its a slow steady decline and it can only end badly. lastly, speaking as one who has finally gotten past 7 days for the first time it feels really good to know i can do it."
NoFap,"i wish you success, too. NoFap is not for everyone. it's a choice, made by people who think it will make them happier. if you're happier without NoFap, that's awesome -- do the thing that makes you happy.   that said, i don't agree with your take on the nature of the board. i don't think anyone here is saying that sexual release is unnatural or inhuman. nor do i think anyone is saying that fapping, porn, etc... is for losers. i think what people are saying is that, for reasons that we really only guess at -- neurochemistry, upbringing, deeply ingrained habits of mind -- PMO makes up feel/think/act and we don't want to feel/think/act. it's a philosophy born of experience. it doesn't work for us.   you're right to be unhappy when someone claims that all pro-fappers are in denial or that all porn stars are victims of abuse or when someone tries to impose their opinion rather than share it. that said, i find the tone of the board to be overwhelmingly positive. look at a thread for someone who relapsed: the comments are almost invariably positive. "you'll do it," "keep trying," "don't give up," "it happens to everyone."no one is being put down or demonized. everyone is trying to support each other. if there's negativity, it's people being hard on themselves."
NoFap,"This is really good insight. I think I have the same sort of issue. Horniness has played a factor to be sure, but escaping 2 major feelings is where it's at: loneliness and heightened mental stimulation (an inner anxiousness that builds from nofap). The sad thing is I've grown accustomed to being by myself and not sure if I would really take the opportunity if presented (I like to think I would, but honestly probably wouldn't right now).   What's even more interesting in my particular case is I've inadvertently developed some sort of deeper feelings for one of my accountability partners, who happens to be female and near my age, as a result of finally progressing in my journey. Except I feel she is quite distant from me (I suppose you could call it friend zone to put bluntly) and already expressed noninterest in relationships plus I'm not the right religion.   I used to figure it was good to hang out with accountability partners to have help with overcoming obstacles, but I still kept failing over and over. I decided to try a new thing where I would purposefully seclude myself from others and slowly work my way back to hanging out with certain people, and I've found out I'm actually doing pretty good when I minimize my contact with her and stop thinking about her. I'm not desperate or depressed about my loneliness, but simply whenever I go hang out with this person, knowing closeness is impossible only brings up sadness (and urges) when I get back home.   I feel pretty bad and sad about limiting my contact with her now, but this sadness is much more manageable and I get no urges from it. And really, when I limit my contact with her she rarely reaches out to me, so I wonder if we were really friends enough for her to be my accountability to begin with. Tangled webs."
NoFap,"This is a great post. On a lot of levels says all the things you need to know. For example that it took 6 months to recover completely - that's a pretty long time, but when you think about how long you've been fapping to porn, we're kinda lucky it might only take 6 months.   Further, I posted just a bit ago here that you should tell her. My unofficial SO was really understanding and it's helped me stick to it.   I did look through gonewild on two or three occasions but turned away pretty quickly... but this past weekend I had a success and a failure, so it's possible I messed myself up just with a peek. REMEMBER HOW SHITTY THE FEELING IS! Not only that, but push as far along as you can before a success and then REMEMBER HOW AWESOME THAT FEELING IS. The success I had at the end of week 2 made me feel like a fucking CHAMPION and the inconsistency I had even on week 5 brought me back to that disappointing anxiety and concern that my girl took it personally."
NoFap,"Hello mate. I'm a couple years younger and in a similar situation to you, except I interact with girls in a regular enough basis, I suppose, even though I have had 2/3 casual female friends who I don't talk to all that often who treat me decently enough. Only one girl who is fairly close to me in my life. I'm not sexually experienced in any way, and most of my friends aren't as well. I've been on some platonic dates but that's about it in the relationship scheme of things. The same thoughts of inadequacy have tormented me, and either I've talked with girls only to get rejected or they hit on me hard and a do that back, until they stop and ignore me, which has crushed me. I've been talking with this girl for nearly a year now and I'm at least a decent friend to her, and I'd like to take it to the next level, but that's another story. The point is, you can't let rejection dissuade you. Even if you ask out a dozen girls and they all reject you, won't your perseverance be worth it when one accepts and makes you forget about the other girls who decided to not give you a chance? I know it may sound hollow when it hasn't been working out for you previously, but you're not doing anything wrong by asking, and it very well can pay off. If you give up completely, then you're robbing yourself of opportunities. I've been hopeless and bitter and have laughed at these words, but hopefully you realize that rolling over because women aren't flocking to you isn't the end of the word, and doesn't necessarily reflect on your personal qualities.   I'm really thin physically and can't put on weight, except a bit of muscle, for the life of me, so I can't really relate to that personally, but it sounds like you should keep on doing what you're doing. As other people have said, it's not about having a girl to cuddle; that's not the point. It's about developing emotional and social connections with her, which lust alone may try to trick you into believing you already have, or can obtain, especially from pr0n, or random pretty girls you may see and never talk to.   Honestly, that's all my weary mind can produce at this late hour. Maybe you're right. Maybe people like you and me are doomed to be shit out of luck with women for eternity. I've felt the same feelings as you, and they're some of the most demoralizing I've experienced. But NoFap is largely about self-improvement, and encouraging you to have the drive to do so through ending your PMO habits. You CAN be happier by improving yourself, for instance by clearing your mind of toxic thoughts which only serve to breed misery within you, in turn creating a plethora of other problems. If you are getting fitter, it may take some time for your body to adjust to these changes, so you may have quite a decent body in a few months."
NoFap,"Dude! Watch out for that 'where-is-my-sex-drive' thing. I've just relapsed yesterday and IMHO it is normal, that sex drive varies over time. And I also think that it might come back as you begin to feel all secure and confident in the moment, just for enough time for you to relapse.   It's a shame you started edging, but it's great you stopped. I'm proud of you! Watch out and I wish everything good for ya!"
NoFap,"This is a much more case-by-case issue than porn.  It's hard to find any net benefit in porn, but masturbation alone, being tied much more directly into the human body, is harder to study.  Many people find masturbation physically and/or mentally draining even when done without porn.  On the other hand, there are some studies that correlate moderate masturbation with slight increase in prostate health.  It is noteworthy, though, that good diet and exercise far outweighs the supposed benefits found in said studies."
NoFap,"I used to only be on the computer to browse NoFap and try to encourage others. But all of sudden the posts were all 'First time on NoFap, I'm starting today my cleanliness' and it was about a third of the new posts, than the rest were mix of 'Fappers are scum', 'hooray for [insert number of days clean here]' and 'NoFap is good for getting you laid'. It's good to see the come back of motivational stuff and methods of helping you when you're in a tough situation.   Back in the day of about 60k members, there was lots of information on the lines of facts and science to help focus, there was the odd guy shouting 'You had a wet dream, you failed!' but all in all it was more a community and fact forum.   I still would promote people to do it, but please don't force people about it or shaming anybody. Strong support makes a structure stable and more a safer place."
Mabinogi,"If they changed the Engine, the game will run so much better, and allow them to do much more, however, a change like that would no doubt require some huge problems in the code. Ground up changes, I doubt they'll even want to consider doing something like that, since everything we get is based off of the Korean updates. Like we got the 2014 RESURRECTION folder a month before we got Ninja's, because that's what it was called on the Korean servers."
nononono,"Actually, running the outriggers down would have made it much worse. They can basically become ice skates on smooth hills like this one, especially once the machine has already gained a lot of momentum. It would also take away from the operators control (you can't steer outriggers).   And by the sound of it, the engine was not running and the whining that you hear is actually the weight of the crane turning the transmission and engine over. Yes, these machines are generally underpowered for travel as they are off-road and moved from job to job via low-boy trailer."
CFB,"First, I would relax.  I thought what I said was fairly clever.   Secondly, what I said regarding LOIC for OSU is something that is entirely possible and may happen.  This seems like an example of the truth hurting.   Now, is taking money or free tattoos illegal?  No.  However, it is against a clearly defined NCAA policy regarding additional benefits being paid to college athletes.  That's a fact.  Those OSU players took those benefits.  To add to the Tat-5 there is detailed testimony from former players regarding the fact that this has been going on for a decade.   Now, on to the fact that PSU has had many problems with players over the past decade.  They have and the PSU football program deserves all the criticism it has gotten for it, too.  ESPN Outside the Lines did an entire story on it.  The law deals with those individuals like the NCAA deals with OSU on the NCAA violations.  However, what you're comparing is apples and oranges.  Penn State has never had one single major NCAA violation.  There are a handful of schools, I believe around six, that can say this.   I've seen opinions from many OSU fans over the past few months.  The reactions have been pretty split.  You seem to fall on the side that doesn't want to admit OSU should take responsibility for the problems within their program and instead you spend your time trying to deflect any criticism of OSU by bringing up issues other schools have had."
CFB,"in my defense, i was in vegas this weekend and only got to watch about 15% of the football i would normally. as well, i had Wisky as my anchor on all 5 parlays i made. so maybe i treated em harsh w their ranking this week, but they cost 1200 dollars that i coulda collected  immediately  before the bachelor party i was attending left for Treasures scrip club (god damn is that place awesome. would of gladly spent at least 6 or 9 hundred of the mythical 1200 iwas "due" [wisky ruined 3 parlays that would of paid off a total of about 700 in reality. i blew the other 2 w other games as well {friggin wazzou}]"
CFB,"I wrote up a piece about this a few months back, but I would like to reiterate a few things:   They do not care about the well-being of our beloved sport, College Football. They do not care about the well-being of other sports - say, College Basketball, or the MLB, or the NBA, or any of them.   That company does not care about care about the well-being of their "lesser" journalists. You'll note that when  Craig James  was up against one of their less favored children and it kinda looked like they had to choose... well, here's [why Bruce Feldman no longer works for them](   Journalistic integrity? Pfft, why bother? Just say you got your information from a "source", problem solved. Its not their fault if the information on their front page is wrong - its the "source's". And when they run into a problem area where they might be conflicted? They just bury their heads and move on - this is  heavily  rumored to be why [Pat Forde left]( I will note that this is only rumored, and has not been openly stated.   Remember when Texas A&M (if you're on a phone or have flair missing, A&M is my school flair) was having such of a bitch of a time moving to the SEC? And it seemed like ESPN was one of the last places you could go to get accurate information on Conference Realignment? Well, [depending on who you ask, there's a pretty good reason for that]( Turns out trying to create a monopoly on sports coverage can have dizzying legal implications.   ESPN  used to be  one of the best things to happen to sports. They were clever, witty, and informational. They summarized the sports world in quick twenty minute bites before work, or between class, or after you got home and were just waiting for The West Wing to come on.   But somewhere, they stopped reporting stories and started making stories. At some point, they became Jim Rome, Skip Bayless, and Lou Holtz. Yeah, they might be entertaining - but they're certainly not what I would think of as the best parts of sorts.

Had Hitler said people with brown hair and silly mustaches were the master race, everybody would've told him to fuck off; if he'd been blonde-haired and blue-eyed, he might not have been so convincing. Sometimes people will only take you seriously if what you're saying isn't self-flattering (possibly because self-flattery has a high correlation with dangerous rationalization: "We're the vanguard of the proletariat!" "I am the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, your Lord and Savior!" "We, the government, acted just in time to save everyone from economic catastrophe!" "If I jump off this bridge, I'll fly!"). Reflexively, if you say something that's obviously bad for you if it's true, people tend to listen."

Based on what i saw he might never play football again I hope that not the case but from the looks of that play its a very real possibility.   He spent the last year rehabbing his other knee to come back and play at a high level. Only to have this happen.   This is a young man that has great talent and by all accounts and even better person.  He was most certainly a first round pick and his football future is now very much up in the air.

CFB,"President got involved in a couple of money scandals. One of the ADs got the university in a sexual harassment mess. The President decided to send us to the fucking Hawaii bowl last year. New AD is appointed and everyone hates him.   President is forced to resign so now we have no leadership at the university. We managed to lose our football and basketball coach in the same year. No idea if Current AD will be around next year. Current Coach thinks starting 5 QBs in a year is a good idea and has no idea what the university situation will be like."
CFB,"This is what I would love to be the post-season in college football.  The bowl games are still below these 2 tournaments and the losers in the first 2 rounds drop down into bowl games.  These 2 tournaments are the national championship tournament (Tournament of Roses, ToR) and a kind of NIT with the next best teams (Orange Bowl Invitational Tournament, OBIT).  There are just a few simple selection rules that I followed to come up with this field.   1.Every conference champion of a conference with at least 8 teams gets to participate in the ToR.  The left over slots are decided by the BCS rankings.  The OBIT field is determined by the highest 8 teams in the BCS that did not get into the ToR.   2.Teams from the same conference cannot play each other in the first 2 rounds (this affectively limits a conference鈥檚 participation to 4 teams in the ToR and 2 additional teams in the OBIT).   3.If a team participates in their conference鈥檚 championship game and lose, they cannot move behind a team from their own division that is ranked behind the participating team leading into the conference championship game (This year, Georgia cannot move behind Florida because Georgia was ranked higher than Florida heading into the SECCG).   Format: The first 2 rounds of both tournaments are single elimination and are hosted by the higher seed.  The winners of the 2 bracket pools of the OBIT advance to the Orange Bowl.  The 4 winners of the bracket pools of the ToR are re-seeded (highest seed left plays lowest seed left, 2nd highest seed left plays 2nd lowest seed left) regardless of conference.  The highest seed left in the tournament then chooses which semi-final bowl game their semi-final will be (Fiesta Bowl or Sugar Bowl).  The winners of the Fiesta Bowl and Sugar Bowl advance to the Rose Bowl National Championship Game.   Other: This post season structure would not work with our current model of a 13th conference championship game so in order for this to happen divisional conferences would need to have a sort of cross over last week so that all the teams are playing the week before the tournament would start.  Also, all teams would have to play 12 games in the first 13 weeks, then week 14 and 15 would be the 1st and 2nd round of the tournament.  There would then be a final exams break and then the semifinal/other bowls/Orange Bowl would happen followed by at least a week break and then the Rose Bowl Final.  Before people say that 16 games is too many, I would just like to point out that under the current system USC is going to play 13 regular season games next year (due to going to Hawaii) and if they make the Pac12CG and a bowl they will play in 15 games.  Then, starting in 2014 if a team goes to Hawaii they could play 16 games if they play 13 regular season, their conf. championship, the semi-final, and the Final."

Funny Story: I was flying down to LA to go to the 2010 Holiday Bowl (was staying with a buddy in OC, drove to San Diego for the game). So we're at SEA-TAC with about 30-40 Husky fans decked out in Purple waiting to board our flight. They had us walk onto the tarmac to board, and you couldn't actually see the plane until you walked out of the gate. Sure enough, I walk out and see the WSU plane sitting there waiting for us. It was funny and slightly ironic. We joked around about our doubts that the plane would make it all the way to our destination, and drank heavily expecting our impending crash."
CFB,"Honestly, people don't just "join up" with lawsuits.  You would usually have to file a motion with the court to amend a lawsuit to include a new person, and while usually each party has wide latitude to amend, it gets harder the farther along a lawsuit goes.  By the time Manziel wants to "join up" with a completely new claim, the judge may say no because it would open tons more discovery and be an unfair surprise to the defendants."
CFB,"Back to your original bet: you're pretty close to guaranteed to make $13k on your $1 million bet, but when you do loose (and upsets happen so you will loose eventually - see App State  vs Michigan), you loose big, $1 million big.   The completely fair bookmaker would estimate the probability of a team winning say Team A has a 90% chance of winning, and then set the odds at 9:1. If you bet $900 on 10 games then, 9 of them turn out to be wins and one loss, you win $100 each for the wins and loose $900 on the one loss, so you and the bookmaker would both come out even in the end. However, the bookmaker is a businessman and needs to make money, so he either charges you a fee (say $10/bet), or sets the odds higher, say 10:1. If the odds are 10:1 (and the probability is still 90%), then over your ten bets you win $90 nine times ($810) and loose $900 once, so the bookie makes $90.   The only way you can beat the bookie over a large number of bets is if you can better predict the chance a team has of winning. If the probability of a team winning is 50% and the bookie sets odds at 1:1, but you know the team actually has a 90% chance of winning, clearly you can make a lot of money.  However, bookies are professionals: they set odds for a living and need to be good at doing it to make any money. Therefore, it is very unlikely that you will be able to outsmart the bookie.  Betting against the spread gives you a better shot, because then you are actually betting against the general public."
CFB,"The fan you're thinking of, Steve Bartman, got death threats for interfering with a ball that Moises Alou (a Cubs' player) was attempting to catch. Although the ball was hit in to the stands, a jumping Alou more than likely would have still made the catch had Bartman not tried to catch the ball himself. In baseball, a ball hit in to the stands is fair game for fans, but it's common practice for home fans to not go for it if their player can sill make a play. The incident occurred in the 8th inning of Game 6 of the National League Championship (which they had a 3-2 series lead) with the Cubs ahead 3-0. They then went on to give up 8 runs that inning, lost the game 8-3, and the series in 7. Cub fans like to point fingers at Bartman, blaming him for the fact that they didn't win that game and move on to the World Series for the first time since 1945.   As a minor detail, Bartman also happened to be wearing headphones, so he could listen to the game on the radio."
CFB,"ok...but the SEC is 1-0 vs Teams that were in the PAC at the time the game was played.   Utah was in the Mountain West when they beat Bama in 2008.  This data reflects conference affiliation as it stood when the game was played which (IMO) is the only reasonable (though tougher) way to look at this stuff."
CFB,"This logic fails me for 2 reasons.     If you had a better defense, why wouldn't you want the QB that can put the team on his back like nobody's business, especially if he is slightly more turnover prone. That means that your defense could handle more turnovers and potential get the ball back to your team carrying QB quicker and without the other team scoring. Which would mean less points scored off of turnovers.     Looking at Johhny's turnovers, 1 in the Bama game was his fault(the pick six), the other was the receivers fault. His other turnovers(even the one that was his fault in the Bama game), you could argue that because he doesn't have a defense that he has to try and force the subject a bit more often than Mariota. If you can't trust your defense to make a stop then you are going to make some throws that might be in a tighter window."
CFB,"I'd rather have Mariota as a pro prospect, but just for the purposes of this season, I'd go with Manziel, sheerly because he is putting that team on his back.   Mariota has better stats, but he has never had to play from behind. Right there apologetics for Manziel's stats are a two-edged sword: he has to throw more because the Aggies are behind so often, so he gets a lot of yards that way, and a lot more opportunity for turnovers.   With those caveats, and not even accounting for SOS, again, I'll go with JFF for this year. Basically what I mean is this, all things being equal (which they never are), Mariota is dominating and doing everything just about perfect, but has he really been challenged? Have there been any instances this season where everything hasn't gone right? You could say he is the standard against which we're measuring Manziel, and that right there, the fact it's even a question, makes me lean toward Manziel because the gap is not that far."
CFB,"IWhat FSU has going against them is not Oregon, it's Alabama. When you look at voter breakdown, you see that the west coast guys were much more likely to vote Oregon 1st or 2nd, as expected. East of the Mississippi, virtually everyone is voting Bama #1 and a lot of votes for FSU at the 2 spot. FSU isn't going to steal votes from Oregon. They need Bama to look rough in a game or two. If that happens, FSU would likely be the beneficiary of 1st place votes as opposed to Oregon because voters like to keep a regional team #1."
CFB,"My apologies for the hostile tone. It was a grouchy hangover comment, and not meant personally.   My point is, the 70 or so characters in the tweet convey significantly less information than the statement that he makes. Based on the tweet itself the issue could still be up in the air, but when coupled with the statements there is no ambiguity as to Briles' plans for the near future.   Twitter is incredibly useful, and in many situations (admittedly including this one) it is trustworthy. However I can think back to several times when that has not proven true. That's because Twitter has no gatekeepers, and a limited space to convey complex ideas. That's why we need to subject Twitter to a decent amount of scrutiny, and (in my opinion) defer to more detailed sources. Not doing that contributes to the sort of speculation and rampant misinformation that has unfortunately become the hallmark of modern journalism.   Once again, my apologies. Looking on this with more sober eyes this is how I would like twitter posts to be handled. You're probably the only person that is going to read this if you even bother to, but i would like you to know that I'm not a sophomoric asshole (which is what i sounded like), but a drunk journalist with a bone to pick with the sports media."

CFB,"2012-2013.   Top five defense, NFL-caliber running back, untested quarterback. So naturally, we ask said untested QB to throw the ball 40+ times in several games and go 7-6 on the season, despite giving up 20 points or less in four of those losses (and not giving up a single touchdown in one of those losses). In the bowl game against TCU, untested QB #1 continues to shit the bed, so we throw in  another  untested QB. Untested QB #2 throws for 47 yards, which somehow translates to a dramatic comeback victory. He then parlays that 47-yard performance into the starting job the next season, and well, you know..."

CFB,"Tech has a winning record over every team in the state over the last 20 years. You might have a case for recruiting, but that's just due to Baylor's recent success (with a Tech alumni and former coach guiding it) and AnM joining the SEC. In 2010 we finished a 15 year streak of housing Baylor and had a winning record over AnM in the Big XII."
CFB,"NOTE: THESE ARE ALL PURELY HYPOTHETICAL AND NOT ACCURATE NOR EXPECTED IN THE LEAST BIT.   Texas:  Strong kicks off 13 more players, including all kickers and punters. As such, he is forced to take an aggressive style of never punting the ball. Unfortunately, the only QB he hasn鈥檛 kicked off gets injured in game one against UNT. Texas loses every game in the season, Strong is fired.   Auburn:  in a shocking to the fans, not shocking to the rest of the country turn, Auburn has a two-win season. Furious fans fire Gus, only to find later that Auburn fans had been paid millions to take dives by Alabama fans who never attended either school. The school apologizes to Gus but he has already been hired by the University of Texas.   Kansas:  This one is interesting, as they fire their coach after two games, both of which were wins. The reason they do so? Mack Brown asked them to hire him as their head coach. Renewed with vigor over being fired by Texas, Kansas then wins 7 of the next 12 Big XII championship titles and one NCG. Then he grows complacent again and Kansas sinks to an average 7 wins a season and he lives the rest of his days there until passing away in the arms of his star coaching pupil: Case McCoy. Case McCoy then takes over coaching Kansas and leads them to new heights. But I鈥檓 getting carried away.   UAB:  They fire Coach Whateverhisnameis and hire none other than Lane Kiffin, who has used the last year under Saban to learn all the tricks of recruiting in the state and out as well as all his coaching tricks. Auburn and Alabama are left fighting for second place in the state after UAB becomes the undisputed ruler of the state of Alabama."

CFB,"So, this one might be more funny then sad.   My brother was in the band at UT so we'd go to the games at least a few times a year. I'm ten years younger than him, so at this event I'm barely 8 years old. My parents take me to the game and we're on the opposite side of the stadium from the band, and my dad leaves us to go to the concession stand before halftime rush. After about ten minutes, my mom needs to go to the bathroom...so she leaves me there, telling me not to go anywhere. So there I am, all alone. Whatever, I was into the game.   A few minutes later, it starts  pouring  down rain and since it's almost halftime everyone just goes inside to get out from the rain. So I'm standing there wondering what I should do, so I just go inside to the concession stands and look for my parents - of course, it's very crowded and at this point I'm a little scared.   What's an eight year old to do? I walked over to a security guard and told him that I needed to find my brother because my parents had gotten lost, and that he was in the UT band. So he escorts me there before promising to put a call in to look out for my parents. Of course, they had already contacted security so they found me chilling with my brother and his friends, drenched to the bone and smiling (cause I love my brother)   I don't even remember the game much."
CFB,"Before I get down voted, let me just preface this by saying Idc where FSU is ranked, as long as its in the top 4. I honestly think that you could make a legitimate argument for FSU to be #1 by simply applying the same argument to Bama and Oregon that is applied to us.   As of right now, Bamas best win is against Mississippi State. They have had close games with Arkansas, LSU , and West Virginia. Their loss came at the hands of a bad Ole Miss team who got shut out this week by a 5 loss Arkansas team and lost to a bad Auburn team. Their best win, Mississippi State, has close wins over LSU, Auburn, and UAB. LSU and Auburn are their best wins. Neither team is very good. We sit here and fault FSU for close wins against poor competition, but can't do the same for Alabama?   Oregon had a close game with WSU and lost to Arizona. Both games are regarded as mulligans because of either injuries or weather. FSU has a dealt with injuries at many key postions all year. There was a point in time that we were at our 4th and 5th string line backers, some of which were walk ons, due to injuries. We were without Jameis for one of the most important games of the year. We dealt with torrential downpour this weekend. We've been injured all along the o line, d line, and at RB. Granted, Oregon has had some great wins, but why is it they get the benefit of the doubt when we've dealt with very similar circumstances for a longer period of time?   The final point I'll make, is that we are the defending champs and currently hold the nation's longest winning streak. I recognize that last year holds no bearing on this year, but you're crazy if you don't think that we get everyone's best shot week in and week out. Everyone wants to dethrone the champ. This also plays into the close games. I think it's ludicrous that people honestly believe that we would get shredded in the playoffs when there has not been a single flat out dominant team in college football this year."
CFB,"That goes back to the whole environment in which these terms are common. Usually, "cisgendered" only comes up when the conversation involves  non -cisgendered individuals (usually--but not always--transgendered people) and their gender identity. Since there's no neutral state with regard to gender in that context, the term "cisgender" serves to avoid normalizing one type of gender identity over another.   While this is usually characterized as "special treatment" or "special snowflakism", the main reason this is done is to avoid pigeonholing discussion. There are certain questions you either can't ask or won't think to ask if you frame gender as "normal" and "trans" (for instance)--not out of malice, necessarily, but because there are certain assumptions that you have to make in order to use those terms."

But it's not something which happens overnight. The transformation is not quick, but takes months. Some people who take the red pill can't take it anymore and commit suicide. They're weak and they were never strong for upgrading.   But once you transform, you feel stronger, more confident and more alive. You are attractive to everyone and you can have more friends than ever. Actually, I would advise the folks from /r/ForeverAlone to go red pill; it's so simple.   People are NOT equal.

It doesn't seem to be actively resisting containment, and it seems to have gotten itself into the predicament it's in (and it's unclear what that is) under its own power. It does not need our help, and if it does, we are unable and unwilling to provide it. This is the least horrible answer. >  > (2) We could believe it's deluded.

The world of conventional objects which the being with the arm describes is not subject to the conventional and comprehensible laws we believe it to be. Its dream-logic about ovens and cakes and casts and invulnerability is the way the world works, not a deluded fantasy by a buried giant. The Foundation's attempts to rigorously study it are futile, because reason itself is a bizarre delusion.

One of the bad things about having a father like mine is that people judge you because of it, even family. My father was extremely abusive to my mom and older siblings. When I finally got to see my family in Florida, for the first time since I was 6, I expected my grandpa to judge us. People here in NC look as us and only see our dad. My dad had tormented his youngest daughter and his her oldest children. Why wouldn't he judge us like everyone else? I was so wrong. My grandpa didn't care who our dad was. He never looked at us and saw our dad. We were his grandkids and that's all that mattered. Nothing was more important to him than his family and that included us.

WarriorCats,"Least favourite leader for me would be Firestar. He was an idiot letting his pride in his own past get in the way of his common sense, and he focused more on the well-being of other Clans rather than his own. Almost every move he made as leader was a detriment to his Clan.   Bluestar's a close second. She had a small stint as a capable leader before losing her mind, but in the end Bluestar's Prophecy ruined her for me. On the word of the cat that thought a piece of prey with weird fur was reason enough to launch an assault on another Clan and destroy its medicine supply she discriminated against her sister's mate (who, might I add, never in his life did anything against the code and was only aggressive in his pride for his Clan, whereas Bluestar knowingly and actively broke the code), took her three newborn kits into a snowstorm (ending in the death of one), and led her Clan to near-ruin. And apparently she was the one to chase Thistleclaw out of StarClan and into the Dark Forest, so the uprising of the DF was partially her fault. And in life she was just such an angsty brat for so long that I couldn't take it anymore.   As for my favourite leader, it's a bit of a tie between a lot of leaders.   I like Onestar a lot because he realized that he needed to cut off his ties to other Clans if he was ever going to regain respect for his Clan, which had under Tallstar lost a lot of that respect by depending too heavily on ThunderClan. And when Firestar just wouldn't let it be, Onestar responded appropriately. It wasn't "rude," it was smart and necessary.   I like Blackstar because he's an effective and cunning leader. He came out of a dark past and turned ShadowClan into a strong, functioning group once more, even accepting Tawnypelt into his Clan and never forcing her to battle ThudnerClan (if you pay attention, she's never present at any battles between Thunder and ShadowClan). Blackstar's actually friendly and accommodating when he needs to be, but he realizes more than most that for his Clan to be respected, he must be respected, and he almost always puts up his strongest front and is always present on the front line of his battles.   I loved Leopardstar. Even with the mistake of aligning her Clan with TigerClan, she always treated her Clan with thoughtfulness.  She was, in my opinion, an ideal leader. She always treated dealings with other Clans as a business deal, always expecting payment for favors and thinking of only the well-being of her Clan as a whole.   But my personal favourite has to be Leafstar. She a leader of a Clan still taking baby-steps, and she realized quickly that, with the absence of other Clans, her Clan  cannot  be normal. They can't follow the traditional Warrior Code, and even though she makes mistakes, Leafstar has always pulled her Clan together in the end. The inclusion of Daylight Warriors means her Clan can have healthy fighters and hunters even in a drought or famine, and her naming technique is quirky. Billystorm is an amazing name, kk."
exjw,"I was never baptized and left the truth when I was in my mid teens. My mom is still a JW and in the past couple years I've come to feel that the org is a terrible thing. So I've bitched at my mom a couple times expressing how it effected my development growing up, how it limited my world experience, how it is a corrupt heartless entity, how it effected me negatively and continues to do so for thousands/tens of thousands if not more people every waking hour of our lives.   I shared these impressions with her only briefly during only a couple instances. We get along fine, and now I just kind of speak diplomatically, regarding the org as just another international non-governmental organization headed by currently seven typical human beings. Nothing special. She'll probably be with the org for the rest of her life, as will her husband because the congregation makes up almost all of their community network. No one is going to turn away from the community they have lived with and been a part of for more than ten/twenty years.   Well I won't say "no-one", but you get the picture. I feel as though we are both fated to live out the rest of our lives disagreeing on some very profound paradigms. But I try to overcome those differences by sharing insights into the way things really work in life. The way people live, and love, and hurt and the struggles we all face. And share examples of beautiful things that happen that are in no way connected to biblical principals. (Sorry, you did not specify if your just leaving the truth, or leaving biblical belief, or the whole deal). To show her that sollutions come from real problem solving, not pseudo-science and metaphysics."
exjw,"Ooh, that's a tough one - I would try to avoid having her attend meetings with your mom unless it's absolutely necessary (which is probably how you're already doing this), and 'de-program' her after every meeting she does attend. Also, take her to a Unitarian Universalist 'church' as soon as you get a chance. They have an excellent religious education curriculum for kids that teaches respect for ALL religions, highlights the common themes and parallels between religions, encourages critical thinking, and distills the essential moral lessons (minus the theology and mythology).  As a secular humanist myself, I feel right at home in the UU culture.   My kids have attended plenty of meetings at the Kingdom Hall with their grandmother as well. Age 4 is old enough to begin understanding (a) people have very different beliefs about god, the universe, and everything and (b) there's a time to discuss those beliefs, and a time to quietly respect them without comment."
exjw,"Yeah. I love my dad, but once when I was 16ish he tried to slap me (again) because he was mad that I didn't take the trash out. I blocked his slap and told him if he ever hit me again I'd "fucking kill him". I didn't know I had that much rage in me at the time, I never would dream of saying something like that to my dad. Needless to say, my dad was shocked. He never raised his hand to me again - probably because I was physically big enough to back up the threat by then. He was kinda' a JW asshole and hit us kids a lot. In reality, it was plain old child abuse and it still pisses me off all these years later. And FWIW that is complete bullshit about "sparing the rod and spoiling the child". All three of my kids are wonderful competent generous kids - one in college and two in high school. I've never hit them."
exjw,"You speak of a desire to learn what the truth is. Well we live in an evidence based world. IF I claim that 20 ft fire breathing dragon lives in my garage, you're going to have a hard time accepting that. In fact you're going to require evidence from me. If I open the door and there is a 20 ft fire breathing dragon that would be enough evidence to convince anyone that my claim is true. If I open the door and no dragon is there well the lack of evidence is going to prove my claim false. No matter how much I tell you that you just need to believe that dragon is there the lack of evidence tells you the truth.   Now let's look at Religion. There are many different religions making many claims. Some of the claims are similar and some contradict each other. How do we tell which is true and which is false? Well once again, we use Evidence.  To date no one has been able to provide any reliable evidence despite the thousands of claims.   Another tool we can use to determine what is true is to use logic. You asked if your prayers were ever answered. Well the Watchtower claims that Jehovah is omniscient. (All Knowing) They also claim that Jehovah has a plan for everyone one of us. Well if Jehovah is all knowing why would we need to pray to him? He already knows what we are going to say if he is all knowing, correct? So why pray? What can you say to Jehovah in a prayer that he doesn't already know?   The same thing apllies to to Free Will. Again the Watchtower claims that Jehovah is Omnipotent (All Powerful) and Omniscient (All Knowing). Also He has a plan for us. Well if Jehovah is all knowing he knows that when you approach the bowl of fruit that you will hem and haw 17 times between the apple and the banana before choosing the apple. He planned for you to take the apple. So how can you have free will to go against an all powerful gods plan? Do you see how the claims of the Watchtower Society are illogical?   They also claim the Jehovah tests us. Why would an all knowing god need to test us? He already knows what we will do if he is all knowing. So why test us?"
exjw,"The extant manuscripts of the writings of the 1st century Romano-Jewish historian Flavius Josephus include references to Jesus and the origins of Christianity.[1][2] Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, written around 93鈥?4 AD, includes two references to the biblical Jesus Christ in Books 18 and 20 and a reference to John the Baptist in Book 18.[1][3] - [ Wikipedia ](   Note that the book in question,  Antiquities of the Jews  only includes two references, and was written around 93-94 AD, which was some 60 years after the alleged death of Jesus. He's not a contemporary, and is writing third-hand information received from other people.   From an article titled [ Josephus on Jesus ]( from Princeton's website:   >There is broad scholarly consensus that the two passages referring respectively to John the Baptist, and to James the brother of Jesus are genuine. A third passage, the famous Testimonium Flavianum found in the Antiquities of the Jews 18.63-64, in its current form summarises the ministry and death of Jesus; but the authenticity of this passage remains contested by many scholars, and has been the topic of ongoing debate since the 17th century. The most widely held current scholarly opinion is that the Testimonium Flavianum is partially authentic; but that those words and phrases that correspond with standard Christian formulae are additions from a Christian copyist. > >In those parts of the Testimonium that are commonly regarded as authentic, Josephus describes Jesus as a teacher and miracle worker, attracting a large following who revered him after his death; but, other than James, Josephus names none of the founders of the Church such as St. Paul, St.Peter or any the Twelve Apostles, nor does he refer to basic Christian doctrines, such as the Virgin Birth, the Incarnation or the Atonement, which has led some to suggest that Josephus may have been an Ebionite Christian."

Do you actually think Shepard can change the Catalyst's mind about it to avoid sacrificing himself?   > I am not arguing over the color of the beams here. Control is seen as the Paragon option where everyone lives, including the Reapers; yet somehow scumbag TIM, whose methods would make even Hitler look sane, represents this ending? Then Anderson, who repeatedly argues that the ends don't justify the means if millions have to die in the process (look at his arguments against Saren in ME1), represents the ending where you annihilate all Synthetic life in the universe?   The difference is the motivation behind. Control+TIM is evil because he wanted to use it to make humans the rulers of the Galaxy. Destroy+Anderson is good because he wanted to save the universe from the Reapers.   As I mentioned before, in practical terms Control means sacrificing your life to save synthetic life, and Destroy means sacrificing synthetics for a  chance  to live. Self-sacrifice is paragon, destroying a whole species is Renegade.   > As for traveling at 200x the speed of light, that was only when traveling through a Mass Relay.

masseffect,"Yeah, but it wasn't Shepard, so they obviously did it wrong. I thought it would be cool if Shep went down to the Yahg homeworld and kicked some Yahg ass that's high up in their government, making him one of their leaders. Then he could command them to come help fight the reapers."
masseffect,"I'll go over this point by point.   First, graphics in ME2 vs. ME3. ME3 wins by a long shot. Not because the engines are better, they're about the same; but ME2 had some mess to it that ME3 did an excellent job cleaning up. There's an annoying heavy weapon you carried on your back in ME2 that was like a permanent backpack on you and was ugly to look at. They got rid of that in ME3 and only revisited it when it was necessary. The overall beauty of the ME universe is very well shown in ME3 with long shots of the landscapes you visited in missions. It looks pretty fucking good. ME2 does this very well as well but ME3 takes it to a whole new level, like a good sequel should.   As for character customization, again, ME3 wins. ME2 was very limited in it's customization. Not so much with armour, but when it came to weapons and skills, there was a distinct set you fell into when you selected your profession. There was a good reason for this however. The original ME1 was crazy with character customization. There was too many options for skills and many were unnecessary and flat, way too many armour pieces, and a shit ton of guns. It was a lot of fun, but come ME2, there was need for change and they cleaned up the whole thing really well, and may have oversimplified things. ME3 found a great balance. It took the simplicity of ME2 and the variety of ME1, merged the two, and made it great.   For combat, it can be more personal for some people, but again I feel ME3 wins. Combat in ME2 can be really slow paced, I remember having engagements last minutes in ME2 while engagements in ME3 last seconds. A slight difference, but ME3's combat engine went away from the RPG elements of ME2's combat, and went deeper into a more shooter based feel. this is bad on easy difficulties, but great on insanity and hardcore mode. You felt good when you beat an enemy with awesome powers and a good aim in ME3, as opposed to having to burrow through chunks of shields/barriers, armour, and finally health on every single enemy in ME2. Combat was basically the same across both games, but ME3 was just paced a little faster. As far as I'm concerned that was a good thing.   Open worlds though, are where ME2 left ME3 completely in the dust. I don't know for sure which one has more explorable space, they're probably about the same. But, ME2 had so much more to do, and so much more you could get out of it. Every thing you did in that world gave you something with a direct result. Getting minerals for upgrades, completing missions to gain team members, then more missions to gain their loyalty, then more missions because "why the fuck not" made the exploration aspect of ME2 the boss. ME3 had none of that. The only bonus stuff you could do gave you war assets, which were useless after a certain point. Things that were explorable in ME3 didn't have much substance to them either. You would literally fly over something, press the A button, and get war assets. That was it. When in ME2 most things actually had missions attached to them, or at the very least you would have to scan over the planet for a while before getting the gratification of more stuff."
masseffect,"Erm, no.  He's a well known poster on the penny arcade forums, so even before this people knew he was a bioware writer.  He redacted the post afterwards because very publicly calling out your boss and bosses boss on the fact that their hubris was single handedly destroying a franchise tends to place your job in jeopardy.  Most people went along with the redaction because he's a pretty cool guy + a great writer that we want to stay with bioware so he keeps making the awesomeness."
masseffect,"I see and appreciate what you're saying but I'm less generous with my assessment of how well they fixed things. I'll go along your list though for coherence:   > plotholes with the crew and the Normandy   technically, yeah, but it was so half-assed. Saying "Oh, the Normandy flew in" covers up the raw issue of how the squad got back on but it also kills the momentum of the ending, essentially hitting the pause button on the battle. They traded one flaw for another.   > Relays exploding and everybody starving to death   Also poor coherence with the rest of the plot. Throughout the whole series we're reminded of how advanced the Relay networks are. ME1 has the Protheans, consistently acknowledged as technologically beyond the races of Shepard's time, being barely able to unlock Mass Relay Technology. This is fixed with the again half-assed line of "oh, we can totally fix them. At best the controlled Reapers do it, but what about the Destroy ending?   > The divine nature of the starchild   How is this really changed? I doubt anyone ever thought of the Starchild as God prior to the EC. He's still the exact same puppetmaster he was before. What always made me mad about this was the fact that the Reapers, the enemy with which the player had spent enough time with to actually develop a relationship, were suddenly and completely robbed of their agency, reduced literally to mindless animals. And here's this new fucker which gets to have his cake and eat it too: He's been involuntarily changed by the Crucible, susceptible to new alternatives and without the ability to make the choice himself (it falls on Shepard), yet at the same time the only choices available are the ones he lays out, and if you reject them he can force upon Shepard a new iteration of the cycle. He can't stop you, yet if you don't play his little game you're robbed of all choice? Huh?   > Showing properly what the different choices represent   In a raw sense, yes they did fix this, but it's tied in to what I just said. The choices are fixed, not always coherent in and of themselves, and Shepard can't act like he has throughout the series (neither a Paragon or Renegade would accept these choices at face value) or look for new alternatives? Doesn't fit.   > Providing closure   For the characters, yes. For the overarching Reaper plot, not really. You get a vague sense of what the Reapers are/where they came from, but not enough for closure. What about the keepers? What about the origins of the Relay Network? More about the cycle of extinction? Will we ever have access to the information about past species supposedly preserved by the Reapers, thus justifying genocide? And so on.   > The Crucible being a giant MacGuffin...   Certainly not fixed.   Finally, I think the Reaper threat could very easily have been solved better. You're right in that we were beaten over the head with the fact that the Reapers were unstoppable conventionally, which is why I really hate how ME3 plunges us from minute one into a conventional war full of conventional war thinking.   Personally, I would have had the Reapers beeline for the Citadel instead of Earth (why did they go for Earth anyway?) at the beginning, like they did with the Protheans and presumable every previous cycle. As fits with their MO and common sense anyway, they would have shut down the Relay Network like they did for the Protheans, et al, isolating most of the galaxy from itself and leaving it open to Reaper conquest. However the Normandy, having the wonderful and intelligent EDI as well as a Reaper IFF from ME2, finds a way to rig it so the Relays will think the Normandy is a Reaper, making it the only ship in the galaxy capable of using the Network except Reapers. Cue a high stakes race against time where Shepard has to find a way to unite a scared and divided galaxy both in spirit, convincing them that the end is not nigh, and technologically, duplicating the IFF so more ships can make it through. Ultimately, I would have Shepard make a dangerous run to the Citadel, by now full of indoctrinated inhabitants, to implement a newly discovered reversal of the Relay lockout, preventing the now deployed Reaper fleets from using the Network while allowing the rest of the galaxy to do so. The Reapers are defeated by being slowly swarmed a few at a time by the galaxy's fleets.   Shit, I know that isn't a perfect story but I think it's a lot better than the "find us the biggest guns you can" BS we got in ME3."
masseffect,"So the theory, super generalized and simplified, is:   There are three dimensions, one for each of the ME3 ending options. "ME 2/3" would be about jumping between these dimensions, and seeing how it effected the overall universe. The Normandy SR-2 plus whole crew from ME2 would be in ME 2/3 and would be used.   Now with the inclusion of 2/3, we would all the information from the original 3, plus a bit more, and it would be spread out over the course of four games. With 2/3, we would understand how C/S/D would fully effect everything. Correct?   Sorry about the awful botch job at"
masseffect,"Okay, hear me out:   1). Any class can equip any weapon.   2). With how effective they are, tech and biotic explosions become a high-priority tactic.  By the time I reached Priority: Earth, my vanguard was no longer charging, but instead primed and detonating explosions with Assault Rifle+Incendiary Ammo + Flare.  My Adept was Pulling And Throwing all enemies she saw.  My Sentinel did to bother with Tech Armor, she was Cryoing and Incinerating enemies.  I didn't feel like scope slowdown in the Infiltrator made him stand out as an sniper.  My Soldier was priming explosions with Incendiary Ammo and detonating with Concussive Shot or Carnage.  He didn't bring a lot of weapons in order to fulfill this strategy."
masseffect,"Liara in ME1.  She was really interested in me, and my Shepard was a pragmatist.  In ME2, we are reintroduced to her in a scene where she threatens to flay someone with her mind.  I assumed that she moved on...   After that, I found that Tali was interested, and well; Shepard the pragmatist.  Actually, it was more of a me-as-Shepard Role Playing thing with Tali.  Her loyalty mission was the best crafted mission in the game, and I actually kind of had an emotional connection to her and her people. (And the Geth, but you unfortunately can't romance Legion.)   The thing about Tali, is that she was never really a character; she was totally defined by being a Quarian.  Her romance addresses this, and she says that being with Shepard is the first thing that she's ever done, or even really wanted to do, for herself. It's not complicated, but it is heartfelt.   My main Femshep playthrough romanced Kaiden in ME1, because why not?  Then he was an idiot in ME2 and his letter said that he moved on.  Alrighty then.   She then romanced Garrus because she felt sorry for him, and his reach and flexability pun was hilarious.  (Actually, I've heard that Garrus is the most popular female romance, so I went with democracy)   I also have playthroughs with Miranda, as her character arc through romance is also very good ( accepting her accomplishments as her own, not the result of her genetics ), loyal to Ashley and Kaiden ( maybe they were having an off day on Horizon ), and loyal to Liara through LotSB; but none for Thane, Jacob or Jack.  I can't see being attracted to Jack ( she's chaotic, I couldn't trust her; though I heard that she has a good romance story, too ); I've heard that Thane gets  more  depressed when you romance him, so I wouldn't want to do that to him; and Jacob would just be another "because hey why not" romance, and I felt that staying loyal to Kaiden had more significance than ditching him to be with Kaiden 2.0 ( now with bigger pecs ).   Yeesh, that was long."

GrandTheftAutoV,"I understand that it's a lot to load, but there's also an 8gb install. When you add up the lobby timers and entire minutes of loading screens for every single session change, it gets a bit tedious; especially for those with limited play time.

To the point where you're spending more time grinding and waiting to grind than actually having fun. Then there's the cloud servers, the timeouts, the session kicks, the unable to connects, the progress loss, the  fucking  payout nerfs...   I've probably spent less than 1/4 of my time in GTAO actually doing what I want to do. That's a problem. And this is coming from someone who usually enjoys grinding.

I ended up being the lucky guy who killed him. I had $30 on hand beforehand, and $30 afterwards.

GrandTheftAutoV,"from the video you linked   "and together form a crew" - you surely agree you can do this, right?   "tackle a heist" - yea, well, there is no game part actually called "heist", so I give you that, although technically, robbing a liquor store  is  a heist, many of the jobs  are  heists, but I accept, actual multiplayer heists  are  missing atm   "rob a liquor store" - so, back to things that were in the game from day #1.   2 seconds (absolute maximum) of mention in a 3 minute video? NOT significant.   so let's have a look at what else the video tells us about the game -   00:25 "A persistant...world" you know what that means? It means you grow your character as you play.   00:38 "a wide array of redesigned mechanics" - so, it is  not  going to work like GTA IV.   00:40 and a huge array of structured and unstructured activities" - so, not just driving around shooting each other?   00:52  this bit is important  "right after you fly into Los Santos, you are introduced to the world, and it's many opportunities for earning and spanding money" - see how this  already  got a much bigger mention than heists? But wait, there is more to come.   1:27 "complete any job, and you will  earn money  and gain reputation" see? money. You have to earn money. It got mentioned again. It  must  be important, don't you think?   1:30 - 2:00 A  whole  lot of things you can spend money on. I mean, a real lot. That is 30 seconds, solid of talking about  buying  things in game. Must be  WAY  more of an important factor than heists. about 15% of the video discussing this.   2:00 "everything you do helps you progress through the world" - ie, if you do nothing, you will  not  progress. It's not rocket science. "New missions,  rewards " again, it tells you you get rewards for doing missions, this whole earning money and spending it is getting a LOT of talk time.   2:20 -2:40 a whole bunch about the content creator. Again, this is surely significant. Around 10% of the video discussing this.   So I am cinfused why you think I am a fucking idiot to think that maybe the whole heist thing is blown out of all proportion. Yet still, people like you blindly post this same fucking video as proof that heists aresome huge part of the game, and somehow the game suffers because they are missing. Constantly complaining about having to earn money to buy things, when  your own link  prooves that that is the main focus of the game.   So, you can carry on calling me an idiot if you like. Just like I can carry on thinking that you, and all the others like you, are idiots for believing the bullshit that circulates on this forum."
gaysian,"This is really going to depend on the context of the environment.   All cis gay men to some extent are hypersexualized by society as a way to dehumanize and objectify them.   That's where all of the "no homo" and "predatory gay" stereotype stuff comes from and Asian American communities are no exception to this.   If you're a gay guy in America, regardless of your race, you are going to have to deal with people prying about your personal life and even asking really inappropriate questions about your sex life.  It is really uncomfortable and messed up.   As part of orientalist stereotypes, yes, in modern American society Asian men in general are currently racialized as asexual, but IMHO this is primarily applicable to straight passing Asian men.   Furthermore, this "emasculation" of Asian men is done to fuel white patriarchal ego--these asexualizing stereotypes fuel colonialist fantasies and myths.   On the  other hand, in a lot of gay circles, gay Asian men tend to be hypersexualized the way Asian women are.  Just look at the exotifying and dehumanizing way Asian men are depicted in gay porn."

Meteor,"Hey, there. I've been in IT for 20 years, and I see people ask a similar question to this all of the time - "what's the best framework?".

Meteor is one-of-a-kind in this way (see Meteor's principle #3).   You just need to learn Javascript.   I recommend four things:     Forget Meteor for now.       read chapters 1-8 and chapter 13. You could knock this out in a day! Read them again & again & again & again & again. It has a built-in code console that let's you play with the example code [like this](       Get this tiny book ["JavaScript Phrasebook"]( - it has a good number of code examples for common tasks in Javascript.

airsoftmarket,"A thompson is a great gun if you are willing to put in the effort and money to make it special and be unique. However, they are certainly not the easiest guns to deal with.   First off, the version 6 gearbox shell and bushings are unique, so spare/upgrade parts are not the easiest to find. The gears are standard, but everything else is unique to the Thompson as far as I know. Also, the hop up is unique and as far as I know, there are no aftermarket ones, so if you want to improve it, you are no your own.   As well, the design is notorious for barrel wobble/breakage, so you'll have to fix that (JB weld typically) for longevity and accuracy   In addition, the mags are are unique (no sharing) and the method of insertion/extraction is tough for those unused to it (slot engagement, no magwell, and the mag release is best pressed by the hand removing the mag).   Finally, don't get the "m1928," it is not historically accurate (mixes the m1a1 style upper, lower and stock with the m1928 style frontend and drum), so unless you are going to put in the time to make it look good (fill out the receiver primarily)."
misfitstv,"O.k.. Not to say you have no idea what you are talking about. Let's just say this is an actual room.  >I agree. However, these supposed "problems" you pointed out are all very, very minor superficial differences that could each be changed in a two-day DIY project.   Two days!!! Fuck are you insane? The plumbing alone would take at least, two days. Not  to mention the removing of the step-up before, setting new tile. Also another one of  what you, consider minor differences is the removing the cubby holes Drywall then paint. You'r  looking at a week at least with multiple crews working weird hours. Then the DIY factor, plus trips to local supply shop that at least adds 2 weeks onto your original  "2  days".  What you fail to notice is that the "room's" walls have some how moved closer together by at least 6 inches. Then extend the room making the tub further back from the Toilet. Why would you do this?"
weddingplanning,"u/weddinggirl2015 beat me to it, but yes, that camera is not professional grade. The biggest issue in this case is that using a high ISO would result in less acceptable (noisy) pictures on that camera than if you used the same high ISO on a better camera.   The mm (length) of the lens doesn't really matter in this case. It's the other number, the aperture, that matters. If she had a better camera, she could get by with a 2.8 lens, but with that camera, she'd need to have or rent a 1.8 or 1.4 lens (lower number = better for dark situations)."
weddingplanning,"We're trying to save money, so our save-the-date was a text message, an email or a phone call depending on recipient - you do need to make sure you mention that "full invitations will be sent out closer to the time" otherwise idiots will call you asking for more information. You've already sent those, though.   Our invites were literally a single sheet of A5 paper, folded in half, in an envelope (we did stretch to some fancy paper and envelopes though). The invites had on them:     Where it was, including a map I made in Inkscape, and how to get there by train / car etc.     What time things were happening     Contact details and directions for 3 hotels, including the one we'd arranged a deal with     How to RSVP: a phone number, a postal address, and a tinyurl link to a Google Form (which had fields asking for the names of everyone coming, if they needed high chairs, and dietary requirements).     The names of the people invited (handwritten), so we could make it clear if they had a +1 or not, if their kids were invited, etc.       We  didn't  pay for them to post anything back to us. I've been to a few weddings (here in the UK) and never seen that, so we didn't even consider it. We also only used cheap stamps.   Also, it is  definitely  not bad taste to ask for names - especially if they've got a +1!"
weddingplanning,"FMIL isn't driving me insane (yet) but we do have different ideas about flowers. I'm not huge on flowers, don't care for flowers, honestly don't really like flowers  much. They smell and remind me of funerals because I went to way more of those growing up than weddings (and I was a flower girl 7 times!). My FH hasn't given me flowers in years because he knows I don't like them. I didn't rear want flowed at the wedding except for the necessary ones needed like bouquets, boutonniere, and corsages. For decor down the aisle and on the reception tables, I want LOTS of candles, with at most petals around them. But FMIL wants way more flowers in the decorating. I was planning on just getting Costco flowers for the flowers I needed, I didn't want I have to deal with a florist, and we're having our wedding 6 hours away from where we'd be getting flowers if we were to add flowers to decorations."
homeowners,"This is good advice.  The people we bought the house included the clothes washing machine and clothes dryer in the purchase price (they were downsizing to an apartment).  We had our own that we were bringing in, but I have rentals and would put them in there.  We left ourselves a couple weeks of time before moving in to the new place to allow for cleaning, repainting, etc.  My wife was washing the curtains in the washing machine they left.  After tossing them in, she went back to cleaning the kitchen.  Right before we are ready to leave she goes down the basement (full finished basement with carpeting) and I hear a scream.  The clothes washing machine was overflowing water into the basement.  I had about an inch of water on top of the carpeting.  Apparently the switch to let the washing machine know it is full and stop filling wasn't working.  For about 2 hours we had a full force water overflowing onto the basement floor.  Did the old owners know?  They said no, it was working fine the last time they used it.  Could have been bad luck on our part.  Either way, the mess was mine to rectify."
Economics,"Lots of good points, but it over-stated the costs from the unions. The legacy carriers, in addition to (formerly) having high labor costs, also have fleets of old, less-efficient aircraft. These require more fuel and more maintenance. This also requires more crew training (pilots must get rated on different aircraft, as must mechanics, etc...) which raises labor costs. SWA used to have lowest labor costs in the industry largely because they only had one type of aircraft (737) rather than 10 types, because they didn't assign seats (thus saving labor for the gate agents), etc.."

Economics,"The fact that your insurance company has coverage with a doctor means that they negotiated a tolerable price with the doctor. There is a reason they don't offer coverage with all of the physicians.   Did you read the article?  At all?  Here are a few quotes that prove you wrong:  "The result is that, unlike in other countries, sellers of health-care services in America have considerable power to set prices, and so they set them quite high. Two of the five most profitable industries in the United States 鈥?the pharmaceuticals industry and the medical device industry 鈥?sell health care. With margins of almost 20 percent, they beat out even the financial sector for sheer profitability."   "The players sitting across the table from them 鈥?the health insurers 鈥?are not so profitable. In 2009, their profit margins were a mere 2.2 percent. That鈥檚 a signal that the sellers have the upper hand over the buyers."   "In America, Medicare and Medicaid negotiate prices on behalf of their tens of millions of members and, not coincidentally, purchase care at a substantial markdown from the commercial average. But outside that, it鈥檚 a free-for-all. Providers largely charge what they can get away with, often offering different prices to different insurers, and an even higher price to the uninsured."   "鈥淥ther countries negotiate very aggressively with the providers and set rates that are much lower than we do,鈥?Anderson says. They do this in one of two ways. In countries such as Canada and Britain, prices are set by the government. In others, such as Germany and Japan, they鈥檙e set by providers and insurers sitting in a room and coming to an agreement, with the government stepping in to set prices if they fail.""
Economics,"It's not about efficiency or cost of services, it's about convenience.   It absolutely is not.  You have the option of buying various different types of food, of various qualities, from various different outlets.  Since you have numerous outlets, and the ability to stock pile, and can choose from an abundance of sources, the food industry is not even CLOSE to the same as the health care industry.  You can't stock pile health care.  In general, you have limited options as to where you receive it, and the way insurance and billing works completely distorts how individuals choose their service providers."
Economics,"The problem of quantitative easing is not the fact that the money is created, but who gets the money in the end.   At present, QE is used to purchase government bonds. This attempts to flood the market with more liquidity. However the prospect of making huge profits from QE activity ensures that the financial market just keeps throwing the money back into bonds After all, QE rewards bond holders by paying them big money. The result is a market that wishes to hold more bonds.   I would suggest a different strategy for QE. Rather than paying bond holders with the money, the Fed pays the money into  Treasury . This would then function as an alternative source of revenue. The Federal Government would then use this money in the same way as ordinary tax revenue. This would include a drop in the issuance of new bonds, as some money is being sourced via QE rather than from the marketplace."
Economics,"Ummm, no.   Bitcoin is a 100% decentralized, peer-to-peer network protocol. This means any communication is done completely between two individual computers on the net, and in this ad-hoc fashion is propagated to every other machine throughout the entire network. The Bitcoin client node discovery process is complex, but it uses a multifaceted approach which includes remote callbacks from incoming calls, IRC channels, DNS requests, default lists, remote database retrieval, and user-provided lists on startup. All of these methods are independent of one another, and can be used either in conjunction with each other or standalone.   Further, all communications are handled through ubiquitous TCP/IP connections, the core protocols of the Internet as we know it. There is no realistically effective way to determine whether a sent packet is Bitcoin-related or something else entirely.   Some other networks that work similarly include Bittorrent and the TOR Browser, the former of which governments have tried unsuccessfully to shut down for years.  And Bittorrent is not even as decentralized as Bitcoin, because it requires file trackers in order to initiate a download process, which must be stored on a server somewhere to be useful.  (Scratch that, problem fixed.)"
Economics,"Ok, here I go with some un-sourced but easy to read about info on asset protection.  It is all general stuff and none of it is reasonable legal or financial advice of course.  In the US there are ways to protect assets pretty well that are cheap and easy to do but not a lot of people use them or know about them.  Basically the trick is to use the Corporate Veil idea (Wikipedia it) and partnership entities to shield the valuable property or etc from legal action.  I believe it will protect mostly from lawsuits from individuals and may be less robust against organizations like the IRS.   The idea is to create a holding company and an operating company. (Wikipedia)  Both of these will be LLC's.  The holding company will own all the assets (cars, land, gold, stocks etc.) and will  ONLY  ever do business with the operating company.  The operating company will own next to nothing and will lease all land and property, borrow money etc, from the holding company.  Basically the operating company will be a broke homeless bum on the side of the road.   Now lets look at some legal attacks on this structure.  Lets assume that the same 3 people own all shares in both companies and the operating company gets some bad debts with bad people (Citi Bank!) and cannot cover them because it has been dumping all its income into the holding company through a property lease or some such method.  So the bank tries to sue to get paid back their money and low and behold, they have nothing to take because they can only sue the operating company and can never sue the holding company.  This is because they never were doing business with them!  What a great deal.   Ok now lets look at the other direction.  One of the 3 owners gets drunk, gets a machine gun and shoots up a baseball stadium dressed like Elmo from Sesame Street. Dozens are killed and the families decide to sue Elmo and the highly valuable holding company for all its assets.  Well they will only be able to take Elmo's personal assets and cannot touch the holding company because of a legal precedent whereby one partner's illegal actions in their personal life should not affect other partners in the partnership.  The holding companies assets are protected again from seizure.   Now in the case of the IRS or eminent domain my guess is there would be ways around this with enough work and time.  In that situation a diversified set of holding companies across a broad spectrum of asset classes in many varying locations (international!) should assure protection for your vast kingly wealth for generations to come."
Economics,"Define austerity.   The debate in the Eurozone has been, broadly speaking, "holy crap, people are refuse to lend us money".  It hasn't been driven by  any  papers, nor has anyone seriously suggested that what's happening in Greece and Cyprus is a good policy.  It's been driven by the fact that nobody has any better ideas, and so we get to careen down the road, never  quite  spinning off into the ditch, while people desperately try figure out an answer to, as the saying goes, running out of other people's money.   Conversely if you're talking about the US, the debate hasn't been about austerity so much as "how big should the stimulus be".  Nor are arguments about entitlement reform actually arguments about austerity in disguise, and it would be a mistake to conflate them."
Economics,"The problem as I see it is that we DO need to spend, but we already spent all of our reserves and need to borrow to do it.  That wasn't Keyne's original hypothesis.

But they never yelled "WE NEED TO SAVE" when times were good, so they didn't save, and now we don't have shit and need to spend.  Then they try to blame Austerity like THAT'S the bad guy."
Economics,"The takeaway here is core capital goods.

Economics,"Unfortunately, regulation is the best answer we've come up with to overcome collective action problems by which  individuals acting in their own best interests create a socially undesirable outcome in the aggregate. I assume you're familiar with the prisoner's dilemma, etc.   Consider pollution. Because it's expensive and difficult to purchase sustainable energy, the market-driven solution has always been toward cheaper, dirtier power. But we're not satisfied with that market outcome because it makes us sick and poisons our environment. So we regulate coal plants etc. to force them to be cleaner even though consumers have been unwilling to bargain for those benefits on their own.   Successful businesses like Costco are few and far between and it would be irrationally optimistic to think that the answer to stagnant wages is just to hope that everyone will stop buying cheap stuff so that retail workers make a living wage. Simple economics explains why Walmart, and not Costco, is the biggest retailer in the world. Sure, it might happen in isolated examples, but it's clear that the trend is not a general one we can rely upon to solve our problems here."
Economics,"Title should read "MIT Researcher: Knows Nothing About Economics, Gives His Opinion on Economics'   The guy gets through an anecdote about a kid with $100k of school debt who cant find a job, then offers the solution of more taxes for state funded education and socialist benefits...

His schooling cost a fortune because the government is handing out free money, but the social safety net could never support the population trying to pay back their school debts on social welfare, so he's stuck in a low paying dead end job (soon to be replaced by technology, too).   Yet, technology didn't cause his unemployment -he went to school for a tech job, he's qualified for a tech job- he's unemployed because of an economic crash created entirely by poor government decisions and meddling in the economy, namely the housing market and banks.

I stumbled upon Snowdon's work when going over some concepts in the neo classical approach and was really into the way he wrote. Unfortunately due to limited time and the huge number of topics that needed to be covered I never really had the chance to actually sit down and read the entire book.   Years later I finally have the chance and it's all because of you. This is one of the fine examples where Reddit does indeed deliver!   Thank you OP! Highly appreciated :)"
Economics,"You're not looking at the reason for the deflation. Deflation as a consequence of growing economic productivity is a long-term trend that any economy will experience in the face of free-markets; this is healthy.   You're becoming confused & equating temporary correctional deflationary periods with the former. These temporary deflationary periods are also healthy because they correct the imbalances from the latter years, and realign resources to reflect reality; i.e. people lose their jobs in unproductive sectors. You may superficially view these deflationary periods as  "bad! Government needz to print more moniez!" , but in reality these corrections  must  occur. Refer to the stock market bubble of the 20s; i.e. the "roaring twenties."   Any attempt from government to distort the markets from naturally correcting (deflation) in the short term will be met with long term depression as the underlying structural problems remain unsolved... i.e. the Great Depression. Only after WWII did we come out of the depression; when we cut taxes and government spending, and we had the single greatest year in economic productivity in history. Government Spending in 1948 was cut to ONE THIRD of the level in 1945. AND THE ECONOMY BOOMED.   I refer you to begin here:"

Economics,"Well, all those changes I mentioned took place at the same time as a democratic opening; Mexico was led by one political party for 80 years until 1994 (legislature/governorships) and 2000 (presidency). The system was greased by corruption, nepotism, cronyism, shady business dealings, and corrupt and very powerful government-sanctioned labor unions (I did my undergraduate thesis on them!). All these structural, long-term issues were either ignored or actively harnessed for political purposes. So it's more of a political science/sociology/economics argument than a purely economic one, but my honest view is that NAFTA, plus structural market reforms, plus the democratic opening, allowed these issues to become worse or come to public light. So no, Mexico wasn't necessarily the best candidate at that particular time for some of the "bad" NAFTA things, and it was in a fairly vulnerable position, but I think the country's relatively poor growth and social dislocation after NAFTA - some of which has been severely overstated - was mostly due to domestic factors and not NAFTA itself, though there are some isolated sectors that certainly got the short end of the stick.   anyway,"
Economics,"I would argue that (and I don't have any empirical evidence to support this) there are more things (and more expensive things) that people spend money on. Most 'average' families with school age children have home computers. There were no cell phone bills, internet bills or in most cases, cable television bills. You didn't spend $6 for a coffee at Starbucks or $50+ for brand name jeans.   The 50s were when you started to see the proliferation of credit cards, and greater use of credit in general. Societal pressure to 'keep up with the Jones'' started to become a major force. The 'buy now, pay later' attitude that was developing encouraged people to live beyond their means. Sub-prime mortgages are a more contemporary example: people were getting loans on homes that the could not afford on the assumption that their financial position would improve over time and they would eventually be in a better position to pay off their debts. When housing prices dropped and mortgage rates increased, many of these people were unable to afford their homes and were foreclosed."
Economics,"Your Marxist friend is mistaken in some respects, yet many of the arguments here do not completely isolate the matter at hand. Nor will mine. However, some real world observations:     There is no such thing as a perfectly free economy, nor has there ever been perfect competition. While theory has its uses, it also can obfuscate.   Exploitation often does take place during production. But it is not necessarily a proper conclusion to say that it  must  take place.   The value=cost remark is correct; while value  can  be subjective in a normative sense of the term, it's important to have a more thoughtful discussion about the meaning of  value  for any kind of serious economics which is attempting to account for both quantity and quality. To suggest that value is a matter of perception does not get us too far down the road.   The real question here is: "From whence profit?" (or "surplus" in Marxist lingo.)   One significant drawback in so-called "capitalist thought" is that it does  tend  to undervalue the tangible, physical production of goods and services. Sweat does have some value.   One significant drawback in so-called Marxist thought is that it does not adequately account for human innovation and thought when translated into technology. Brain power does have some value.   Profit results from a concentrated effort to marshal resources in combination with powerful ideas which are mediated through the application of technology. Iron ore was just another rock until humanity figured out how to refine it.   Thus, it takes a combination of both material and immaterial "inputs" to generate both value and profit/surplus value. Honest bankers, industrialists and managers, as well as honest and hard working members on and assembly line, etc... are all integral elements of producing profitable goods. Not to mention a sufficient investment in research and development (scientists/engineers) and machine tools (tools which make tools.)"

Economics,"I upvoted you and generally agree with your way of thinking, but i have to share a slightly different viewpoint.   > Demand that the rest of world bail them out.   Things are not always like they seem. The Greek people were never properly presented with the situation at hand and never asked to participate in making a decision. The loan agreement has not even gone through the parliament. (the structural changes memorandum on the other hand has been voted in)   When our new PM publicly denied thoughts of calling in the IMF, he had already agreed to the bail out, following months of secret talks, as later revealed by IMF director Strauss-Kahn. During all these months Greece was not in a debt crisis yet and was still borrowing from the financial markets. Then, after the new government came into power, we magically lost all ability to borrow with spreads skyrocketing in about a month's time, the speculators having been let loose and fed by "irresponsible public statements" from officials everywhere. And then we entered the IMF/EU deal having been told it had not been on the table before and it was the only way out. Both of which were lies. And our gov had outside help/pressure/whatever to say these lies. (btw, not saying there was necessarily a better way than the bail out, but there were other ways certainly and none were discussed.)   Also, it is debatable if this is a bail out in the traditional sense. The Greek state will be left in massively more debt after the current memorandum (if it even goes according to plan) and facing a new debt crisis when it tries to borrow from the markets again. And it must have done away with a lot of its key assets, sold for peanuts. How is this helpful? If we're on the virge of defaulting now, how will we avoid it then?   Anyway i cannot avoid acknowledging all this could and should have been avoided if our decades old stupid policies were kept under check by our people and its government representatives. But guess what? The corruption/stupidity in this system is not limited to Greece. The IMF was in on this, in secret no less. Big EU powers were in full knowledge of how things were being run here for many decades. It was German companies like Siemens that bribed their way into (unsustainable) Greek state contracts over the years (look it up for more info, very well documented cases are out there).   Now, once again (part of the) money Greece is getting to fight the crisis will end up back in Germany and France (and who knows where else) to buy warships and submarines. Again someone is making a profit out of misery, prospect of armed clash between Greece and Turkey and whatnot..   Since i lack the knowledge to go trully in depth i will end my rant with this [nice link of Daniel Cohn-Bendit's view on the issue, from a speech in the EU parliament.]("
Economics,"No, he is right, that is how they trick smart geeks to confess they are asocial, by admitting what you think everybody would admit.

Economics,"If banks were forced to mark the value of their mortgage portfolios to the true market value, god (or noodles) only knows whether the banks would be in the black or not. However, I suspect many banks (hundreds or possibly thousands) would be insolvent. I agree with StockTraitor that this is a way of building up reserves in the banks toward the day that the bank auditors can rescind the special permission granted a few years ago (at the height of the financial crisis) that allowed banks to choose for themselves the value of their loans rather than the previous requirement of marking them to fair market value. It seems obvious to many that the current scheme of ignoring true reserve value and paying the banks interest on excess reserves and also lending money to banks at less than the rate the banks can earn on US treasuries is a huge scheme to artificially increase bank reserves and to artificially lower interest rates of US treasuries by turning every bank into a shill bidder at treasury auctions on behalf of the US govt. In case you are not aware treasury bidding is done by "Reverse Auction" whereby the lowest bidder wins and the treasuries are sold to anyone who wants them at the lowest price bid. In other words, the lowest interest rate bid is the rate that the treasuries are sold for. So banks effectively act as shill bidders because they can borrow at ridiculously low interest rates from the government and purchase treasuries at a low rate that still gives them a guaranteed profit with NO risk. Then foreigners and anyone else who wants to buy treasuries have to purchase their treasuries at the artificially low interest rate set by the banks acting as the government's shill bidders. Since the government controls the rate that banks can borrow at and controls the reserve requirement (both real and fictional), the government is providing huge downward pressure on interest rates for US treasuries (i.e. the price the government pays to borrow money)."
firstworldproblems,"That's incredibly reductionist, and it's unfair to both the players and the fans. On the matter of emotion, imagine the books or the TV shows you grew up with. Or, hell, the ones you're into now. Saying that watching sports shouldn't have emotion is a lot like saying that you should approach art without emotion. And yet I still can't listen to  In Your Eyes  because of what it reminds me of; if I do, I bawl like a goddamn baby. In the same way, sports can make us emotional. For example, I've been an Islanders fan all my life. I can remember growing up in the years they were always a solid playoff contender, but always out within the first two rounds. And now, they're the absolute bottom of the barrel. On the other hand, I can remember feeling on top of the world as a Yankee fan in 2000, before some of the most frustrating years for Yankee fans in recent memory. Followed up by a World Series win to christen the new stadium. Hell, the Super Bowl is a great example of why sports SHOULD be emotional. Even getting the chance at a Super Bowl is extraordinarily rare. Players spend their whole lives training, day in and day out, in order to reach the point where they have a  chance  at  making it to  the Super Bowl. With the extremely physical nature of football, long careers are rare for a lot of the positions. These players only have a limited number of chances to reach the Super Bowl, and to come so close to one of their life's dreams and fall  thiiiis short  is an incredibly emotionally trying experience. Comparing it to losing a video game is ridiculous. The amount on the line is really hard to understand because you and I are unlikely to be in a situation where one day's worth of work can define how we view our entire life's work. (Unless we're talking MLG that is; while I'm not much of a hardcore gamer myself, the amount of training that goes into eSports is incredible and in many ways just as demanding as any pro sport.)"
Gundam,"I don't understand what you're arguing here? I was just adding on to what you're saying. I also agree Yuuma is the overall better builder although Fumina is not to be underestimated and is not too far behind (due to her ingenius idea of being the support to enhance firepower and creating teamwork being incorporated in a single SD)   I don't believe Fumina is worse than Yuuma though when you are just comparing the Gunpla itself. The reason why I was the one who  separated  them is because I believe at the beginning of the show to the nationals, both Fumina and Yuuma are completely different in terms of builders. Yumma took his artistic grand prix gunpla and just put it in the regional qualifiers without any improvements when the gunpla was built strictly as an art. Fumina had realized she needed a gunpla to complete certain tasks and worked to accomplish that which is a  plus  to her building skills in my book.  So if you haven't noticed by now, i'll just say it outright that it is somewhat obvious for a gunpla to be "great" and succeed in gunpla battling it needs a special trait. I used the words  gimmick  because it fit it overall but i'll explain more clearly. BBG has assimulation (this can be argued but I also think BBG has incredibly strong armor for melee since that is its goal and has taken a hit from mega shiki with the later losing its arm). Winning had its supportive qualities. Build strike had its RG system. Even the Mega shiki created by sakai had particle transformation saber and its high mega cannon. All these gunpla had something to rely upon when the stakes were against them and knew that when up against something of similar caliber would come out on top (such as how mega-shiki's particle saber beat Yuuma's normal beam saber + gyanko's shield) and this requires the builder to know the role of the gunpla and it's  gimmicks  that supports that.   I believe Yuuma just lacks true creativity to make his gunpla have a certain "trump card" in dire situations and instead he relies on playing safe when he is ahead (so he knows his non-optimized gunpla can defeat it) or if the enemy has a decent gunpla he opts to play defensively (such as him running from Saga causing him to rely on his gunpla to defend and as you can see, THE ENDs fangs made quick work of lightning due to its specific build to crush through gunplas). He also sometimes relies on sekai and Fumina to clean up the fight. Yuuma addresses this by realizing he needs to not only change his mindset but decides on upgrading his speed (this could even help his old battlestyle as well). So as shown in episode 15, Yuuma's lightning is no longer a gunpla that just typically does everything averagely (normal beam saber albeit well created, normal beam rifle albeit well created, custom built backpack and artistically good model though it has no extra systems) and has now become a machine that can use its upgraded ultra speed AND beam rifle to completely annihilate a target. So if he has a rematch with Saga, he can use his high speed to evade the fangs or just straight obliterate them with his upgraded beam rifle. In the end, the lightning has a role now as a "I'm going to use range + speed to defeat them" rather than filling the gaps for the team since it is average in everything (when compared to the national level gunplas)   So again i'll re-iterate AKA"
nintendo,"MH3U is certainly the longer game (at least for me).  I've logged about 120 hours in it and I'm not even halfway through the "campaign" or main series of quests.  I have about 80 hours in FE:A, and I've beat the game twice (including paralogues) and have played a fair bit of the DLC.  I'd say they're both a lot of fun, but MH3U is definitely the longer game for most people.  MH3U isn't very newbie-friendly, though, so it will take a couple hours to get the hang of it (/r/monsterhunter is always willing to help you out if you have any questions)."
nintendo,"Your post interested me, so I decided to dig deeper.  I went to  vgpc.com  there doesn't seem to be a large price difference between the three franchises.  (Apologies for the upcoming wall of text)   On Wii, Metroid Prime 3 is $8.29, which is in the same ballpark as Super Mario Galaxy at $8.02 and the Wii edition of TLoZ:Twilight Princess at $8.97.  Other M is only $5.50, but is widely considered the worst Metroid game.  Mario Galaxy 2 is $29.09, New Super Mario Bros. Wii is 24.95 and TLoZ:Skyward Sword is $29.48, although it's worth noting that these are newer than Prime 3.  Metroid Prime Trilogy clocks in at a hefty $86.50, although it was a fairly limited release (but so was the Wii edition of Super Mario All-Stars which goes for $44.80.)   On Gamecube, the Metroid games are clearly cheaper than Mario and Zelda Games.  Metroid Prime is $5.60, and Prime 2 is $9.99.  Super Mario Sunshine is more than both of those at $22.74.  However, Sunshine is still cheaper than any of the Zelda games available for GameCube.  Ocarina of Time + Master Quest is $27.93, the GCN edition of Twilight Princess is $34.77, TLoZ: Collector's Edition is $34.59, and Wind Waker is $35.04.   On SNES, Super Metroid is the highest priced at $39.57.  TLoZ: A Link to the Past is $21.57.  I personally don't consider SMW2: Yoshi's Island to be a Mario game, but regardless of that it's $20.78.  Super Mario World is $10.33, Super Mario All-Stars is $13.94, and the cartridge combining the two is $23.23.   On NES, Metroid goes for $11.99.  Super Mario Bros. by itself gets $6.49, with Duck Hunt it gets $5.08, and with DH and World-Class Track and Field it's $2.71.  SMB 2 is $11.42 and SMB 3 is $10.44.  The Legend of Zelda is $19.26, and Zelda 2 is $10.00.   DS is the other system where the Metroid game is cheapest.  Metroid: Hunters is $7.64.  Super Mario 64 DS sells for $10.90, and New Super Mario Bros. for $12.55.  TLoZ Phantom Hourglass is $14.50, and Spirit Tracks is $15.67.   On GBA, there are ports of the NES games for each, as well as other games.  In the "Classic NES Series", SMB is $18.16, TLoZ is $15.37, Zelda 2 is $10.00, and Metroid is $10.25.  Metroid Fusion is $11.98, and Metroid: Zero Mission is $14.50.  As for the Mario Advance series, the first is $6.50, 2 is $8.11, 3 is $9.00, and 4 is $10.71.  TLoZ: A Link to the Past + Four Swords is $13.40, and Minish Cap is $18.00.   For the original Game Boy, it's Metroid 2 at $9.99 compared to Mario Land at $4.50, Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins at $5.00 (you get a golden coin back in change!) and Link's Awakening at $10.15."
nintendo,"For new N.A. releases, MM 5 and 6 are great. There's a lot of hate for MM 7 because it's 16bit, the formula changed to have an intro level, and you start with 4 robot masters that eventually opens to 8. That being said, I think it's a great game.   MM zero is pretty good, but I think MM zero 2/3 are better. The first one relies heavily on score for completing the levels, and is pretty difficult.   MMX3 is the most difficult of the SNES X series. It offers a lot of new abilities though. I can't beat it without save states. I enjoyed MMX and MMX2 more."
zelda,"My thoughts from nine months ago and its corresponding discussion: [here](   >I would love to see a Zelda title taking place so far in the future that the current timeline either is blurred to irrelevancy or converges somehow into a single thread. I'm thinking about 1000 years or so passes by, and the fantastical world we once knew is just a myth among the inhabitants of Hyrule. > >I'm thinking of a dystopian future where tech has replaced magic/potions/etc and most organic things. It's a dirty and sad place filled with machines and metal. The gods haven't made themselves present since the last game (chronologically) in the timeline(s). > >Link's name is relevant now from a technology standpoint. I imagine Link minding his own business walking down an alleyway on his way to meet up with his friends, when he hears a woman being assaulted. It's Zelda. Link steps in, despite his usual apathetic tendencies (demonstrated in earlier cut scenes leading up to this point). Zelda is ungrateful, claims she could have taken care of herself, and walks away in a huff. Link pursues her, but loses her around a corner. He finds himself in an unfamiliar part of town, and as he's walking and taking in his surroundings, he falls through deteriorated street into some underground passages. Perhaps he stumbles upon the reason why the gods haven't been present in so long. Perhaps he finds an entrances to some of the "old" Hyrule. Perhaps a lot of things... > >It can go a lot of different ways, but I'm very interested in a total departure with regards to tone and setting. At the same time, weaving in the traditional play-mechanics we've all grown to love and call "a Zelda game". > >"
zelda,"Twilight Princess is most certainly worth a playthrough.  It's a solid Zelda game with a good story.  Hyrule is vastly expanded from its OoT days, and graphically it looks as good as a Zelda game has ever looked."
zelda,"How bout no... and go fuck yourself? You're on the internet pussy. If you cant handle it, then go cry to someone who cares. You must not be very headstrong in your decisions if you regret something you did to yourself. Obviously I have thought about this. Hence the reason I am asking for a specific tattoo. The artist didnt wanna fuck it up and draw something I didnt want, so I was reaching out to the zelda tat community to see if they had any cool drawings of an 8 bit triforce."
zelda,"I love design stuff, especially when it comes to games, so it's very possible that it's more interesting to me than to others. Also, I just wanted to do this since a lot of people are complaining about the graphics, I was curious to see what a merge of the two would look like.   I think it's interesting because both MC and ALttP2 are successors to ALttP's design, and they both try to implement that art style into a system with higher specs. Despite this, they two games went in completely opposite directions.   The designers made the MC world brighter and more colorful, but they also made it a lot warmer too. I think I remember reading this week that someone was even complaining that MC was too "yellow" in a lot of places. MC also infuses a lot of WW elements, especially in the way of character design.   ALttP2 takes this in the opposite direction, and while they try to make the game brighter and more colorful still, they make the overall palette cooler instead.   Something else I think is interesting is the overall design approach when you look at this compared to Skyward Sword's art. I've always seen Skyward Sword as an ode to the original games, but now in full 3D. ALttP2 seems to be an ode as well, but taking that even further with the fixed 3D perspective. With that said, it makes sense that ALttP2 would also borrow elements from SS (notice the subtle texture on the grass)."
zelda,"The MEANINGS are in the word. Plural. That's part of the problem here. It means a bundle of sticks. It means a cigarette. It means an insult to a gay man. It means a substitute for "douchebag", etc. It means a British meatball commonly made of pork offal. What makes a definition the "right" one? I'm all for influencing people to stop being jerks, trust me. But we have to be smart about this, we can't tell them they're choosing to bring along the other meanings of the word, because if it so happens that they didn't, we're going to look presumptuous, and if they're jerks....you'll know how far that will go. Jerks will just see us as the ones bringing the baggage around. There's no "winning" this debate for any one side. It's well into the gray area between good and bad. What I'm really sad about is how often I see this argument and so few people involved try to see what makes this issue so difficult, to see the whole picture of it."
zelda,"I personally can't get behind the hate. It's just the Zelda cycle in action, so whatever.   If you already have a Wii or Wii U, go for it! It's the earliest of the Zeldas plot-wise, so there's a lot to learn, play, and explore.   SS's coolest aspect was the swordplay and level design. The three primary areas are densely designed with many obstacles. They're made in a rather organic manner. Navigating them isn't much of a chore once you get far enough in each, since you'll unlock "shortcuts" not unlike what you find in Metroid.   Aside from the glitch that can screw your save up (Nintendo has a channel to fix it and there's a Gecko GCT to prevent it while playing), my only complaints are the Beetle's inability to fly straight once you've steered it and the fact there's no land-based way to travel between the three areas. Had there been tucked away paths to get to each area, I'd have been thoroughly satisfied in the level design department.   If you're a Zelda vet, the puzzles aren't particularly hard, but they at least incorporate something besides blocks. Each item retains a use throughout the game, too; something I can't say about OoT or TP.   The trials (don't worry about it, you'll learn later) were really cool, too. A lot of people disliked them and compared them to the Tears of Light from TP, but the change in gameplay and your utter vulnerability added excitement and depth to what would otherwise be a boring fetch sequence."
zelda,"So a grown woman doesn't have 200$? The chainmail and leather required to make everything perfect would have been roughly 125$. Some link costumes don't include either and can be close to 200$, while ones with actual chainmail and leather parts are either nonexistent or hit the thousands of dollars.   Also you kind of took that the wrong way. I am incredibly picky about cosplays, so glaring deficiencies like the tights just kill it for me. I never meant to insult you or your costume, but simply to point out ways it could have been better. People these days can't take anything other than "noice job m8 +1", and when someone states their opinion with valid arguments they get down voted."
zelda,"I agree with that first paragraph. I liked the Water Temple in the original OOT actually way more than the Fire Temple. The First I played through it, it was me and my sister, and we would play at different times and complete different dungeons, or just help each other out. Interestingly enough, I completed the Water temple all by myself (at age 10). I've since beaten it 3 or 4 times and all I can say is that it is difficult, but I like that it encourages you to think ahead several steps, something reinforced by the fact you have to pause and constantly change your equipment (and play songs). And other than a few really well hidden keys (did anyone else find themselves missing a key right before the room to Dark Link screaming  FFUUU ?"), I found the dungeon pretty fair. I think Nintendo did the right thing but not completely rebooting the temple and instead just making it a much smoother experience for younger gamers and those who didn't enjoy it."
Gameboy,"yeah, sadly it only works for gba, and only on the gba (dose not work on game boy player, I tested). The problem is that the gameboy game boots before the memory stick can, then sense the gba is in "game boy mode" the SMS (super memory stick) can't load. I have tried a bunch of ways to get the SMS to load with a gameboy game, but with no luck."
Edmonton,"If you're asking about party affiliations and political representation, then you only need to count up the number of MLAs and MPs, as others have done already.   I have a different theory, however, based on more literal definitions of liberal and conservative.   If  left-leaning  or liberal is defined as being "open to new behavior or opinions and willing to discard traditional values" (i.e., risk accepting) and  right-leaning  or conservative is defined as "holding to traditional attitudes and values and cautious about change or innovation" (i.e., risk averse) then on this continuum, Calgary is far more liberal and Edmonton is far more conservative.   There are many reasons for this, including economics, labour force characteristics and recent interprovincial immigration patterns. Edmonton is almost 100 years older than Calgary. As its elder and government capital, Edmonton family roots run deeper, generational family finances are more well-established and governance, or rather a respect for traditional due-process, are deep-seeded values as one would expect from a capital city. While more recently a magnet for hard-working, blue-collar labourers, Edmonton was established by judges, lawyers, doctors, politicians - all of whom respected tradition, rule of law and the comfort that comes with slow and steady development.   Calgary radiates a younger vibrancy. It has come to embrace a maverick characteristic of cowboy independence - which is ironic, given the historic necessity of cooperation and collaboration that was required in order to settle the west and turn oil into a national energy driver. But this is the also the narcissistic quality that gives Calgary its youthful confidence. However, eventually, these cowboys became land owners and those land owners became oil investors and they traded their blue collars for white ones, especially after Lougheed granted huge tax breaks for oil companies to relocate and establish head offices around the Bow River.   Older money is more conservative money. It is risk-averse money, preferring government bonds over get-rich-quick schemes. It values reasonable returns over long terms. It is also stingy with the purse strings - willing to put up with repairs over replacements. Old money has been through the booms and the busts. Old money prefers a low-profile - neither losses nor profits are grieved or celebrated in public. When investments are made they are done so after all of the evidence is in. These values embody the character of Edmonton, for good and bad.   Newer money is more liberal money. It looks for unconventional, but lucrative, investment. It resents rules that curb its potential. It doesn't want to be told of the dangers and risks. Newer money is bold, like Calgary. It wants to enjoy the benefits of these riches today; it wants to be current and modern. Nouveau riche celebrates the highs and celebrates the survival through the lows (and the dead or broke tell no tales, at all). Newer money values intuition over evidence. These values embody the character of Calgary, for good and bad.   Edmonton has created a reputation for world-class medical research and clinical treatment; Calgary is creating a powerhouse market for naturopaths, homeopaths and alternative medical practices. Edmonton is a natural base for labour movements and union offices; Calgary celebrates the entrepreneur who walks the tightrope without a net. Edmonton fluoridates its public water supply based on decades of research and evidence on the public health benefits for such a low investment; Calgary does not "believe" in the benefits, opting out of socialized treatment. The oil industry has attracted an international immigration of upper-class to Calgary; the same industry has attracted an interprovincial relocation of middle-class Canadians to Edmonton. Thus, Calgary is a much more metropolitan and diverse city; whereas, Edmonton is more homogenous and traditionally "Canadian" because of its residents.   Calgary is also much more a city people move to; Edmonton is still home to many who were born there. Such characteristics force Calgary to be far more liberal and willing to change due to outside influencers, while Edmonton remains more conservative and less-willing to change. Edmontonians are more willing to pay taxes for services; wealthier Calgarians would rather pay no taxes, in favour of purchasing services when required.   So, while on the surface, Calgary appears politically to be more "Conservative," it is only the economic influences that drive policies of energy exploitation and low taxation. Calgarians, also due to the growing diversity and immigration, vote for their own individual interests. The vast majority of Calgarians earn their living thanks to oil and gas. Voting against the government that has guaranteed this monopoly would be foolhardy. All of these factors support the notion that Calgary, as a city and society, is far more liberal than Edmonton.   While Edmonton looks more politically liberal, it is more a respect for due process, which includes debate amongst differing political actors to inform a better outcome. Debate also slows down change, and Edmonton likes neither haste nor waste. Edmontonians tend to vote for shared interests and the spreading of risk that minimizes the individual impact of failure. The fact the the government sits there connects policy to practice more tangibly than down south. Edmonton also has to manage a more diverse portfolio of industry, which makes it more cautious and risk-averse when it comes to economic development."
LARP,"Gorg makes good weapons, and they're competitively priced with the other pre-made options out there. [Forged Foam]( and [Warlord Sports]( are the two other major makers. They offer comparable products, and it may come out to be a little less. The shield is probably what's really driving up the cost for you. They cost more to start with, and I'm sure it's driving up the shipping. Any of those three stores will probably make you happy, just read the product details to be sure of what you're getting.   There's two other options besides purchasing pre-made swords. Option 1 is making your own from scratch. It isn't what I'd recommend for new players, and it sounds like you already decided against it. It's the cheapest option, but it is hard to make a durable and safe blade your first time through. I'm an editor at [this site which may offer some suggestions.]( [Here's some other tutorials.]( The cost is about $20usd for a sword, down to $15 if you're making in bulk.   Option 2 is what I'd recommend for most people. It's buying a pre-made blade kit from one of the 3 stores, then making your own weapon with that. It brings the cost up a few bucks, but you get a much higher quality blade (which is the most difficult part to construct). Forged foam sells blade kits for $6-8.   Shields can be done from kits, or from scratch as well, with comparable reductions in price."
apathy,"Dude.  We would have missed you if we'd noticed you were gone, you know?   There was a posting about the apathy subreddit about a week ago that made it to the Reddid front page.  When I got here, someone had posted a self "meh."   So I posted a self... something, a link to an apathy joke and sent a message to donbueno that there was some activity then... oh, heck.  This is too much work to recount."
Hunting,"I don't know where I got the bad impression of a trappers.  Some reason I have this image of some guy stumbling out of his truck beer-in-hand up to his trap. Only to find out he caught something out of season that he has to release with a broken leg. After releasing the animal he then throws his empty beer can at the animal to make it run away. He then says to himself, "Well, maybe tomorrow" before wandering back to his truck.   Glad I can put that image to rest.  Sad thing is I know several people who trap.  I should just go check lines with them someday."
Hunting,"That was a wonderful article to read.  It really grasps the multiple views on hunting, from the hunter, the casual non-hunting observer, the guide, and the people that it will feed.   I went to South Africa last month and I can wholeheartedly agree with much of this article and it's message.  Elephants, rhinos, giraffes, and zebras are engrained in our childhood memories as stuffed animals or cartoons.  But in Africa, they are game species like deer and turkey are to us.   One point I will make that I think the author didn't strongly enough cover is how hunting legally, prevents poaching.  Unlike the US, most of South Africa is privately owned land.  As a landowner you also own the animals, so to speak.  They are yours to manage.  If you raise cattle, sheep, or crops, these wild animals eat your livestocks food or your crops.  So they are hunted so that their numbers do not effect your livelihood.  But game farms manage the animals to have a robust huntable population of game animals.  They also protect these animals, with fences, and private security.  If they cannot profit from having an animal on their property (i.e. if elephant hunting was illegal and they couldn't charge someone to shoot it) then there is no use for that animal on their property.   That elephant she shot cost 60,000 dollars, 10,000 of that went to the government, but the other 50,000 dollars went to the guide who will use that to pay his staff, some of whom will include private security to make sure the rest of the herd is not poached.  Therefore one dead animal pays for the rest of the herd to live safely.  It also pays the trackers and skinners for their work.  This way they are more likely to work for an honest guide, than to lead poachers into the same bush to kill elephants illegally.   This is the only way that conservation of these animals will work in Africa.  Governments there do not have the infrastructure and funding to provide the security these animals need.  Our fish and wildlife system in the US, as extensive as it is, cannot stop poaching completely, and one that is much smaller and poorly funded could not hope to curb it over such a large expanse of areas in Africa.   If you've ever thought about going to Africa on a hunt, do it.  You'll do more to help the animals there than donating 10,000 to the SCI or WWF.  It will give you a new perspective on hunting, game management, and life in general."
AbandonedPorn,"Theres an entire small town under the lake by my house. I'll try and get up there soon to take pictures. the lake should be pretty empty right now. Usually is at the end of summer and before rainy season. It's actually pretty close to Shaver lake. Lake Kaweah in CA. I don't remember the story well but they either made the lake or made it bigger and the town had to be moved. didnt take down the buildings and once in a while you can see them sticking up a bit out of the water. I think the area use to just be a river. a decent part of the Central Valley use to be a lake because of all of the rivers flowing in. Shaver might be from this too. blocking off the rivers to dry up the valley. Not sure though.   this is what it use to be. Tulare Lake. Biggest lake on the west side of the Mississippi river. Now the valley is dried up but has some of the best soil for crops in the world."
Bombing,"A lot of people share that same sentiment. There isn't a single part of the town I live in that doesn't have some form of graffiti present. In the neighborhoods, downtown, industrial complexes, etc., graffiti seems to always exist. It's a part of society whether one loves or hates it. I accept it as a constant, and appreciate it for its artistic value. I know many others would disagree with that last statement ("what if it was your personal belongings being tagged?" etc., I've had that happen many times before and I really don't care. Just don't make it suck. Practice/put effort into it and make something dynamic enough to make a random person stop for just a second), but it's ok. Everyone has their own views on this type of art. I embrace it for the influence its had on me since childhood, but I can also understand the anger towards it in terms of personal property. Over the years I've learned, someone will always do it."
BubbleHash,"I've tried it a few times and it really isn't needed. I had the same thought process as you, I thought it would help yield and separation but it didn't really improve my numbers and lowered my quality. Just get a [water cooler]( fill with ice to the top, then water to the top. After 45 minutes that water will be as cold as you need it to be.  As soon as you add the chilled water to your machine or bucket for your first wash, refill the cooler so you have cold water for the second wash, ect. Dry ice is too cold for making bubble anyways, it make the water a slushie and that is not helpful at all to the process. I asked my grocery store and they said dry ice has other additives to keep it clean/odorless, and that I shouldn't be adding it directly to food.  So overall, no i don't think your hypothesis is correct, with regular ice my water gets so cold it makes my hand  ACHE  if i even dip my hand in to adjust my wash bag.  Thats all you really need."
TaylorSwift,"I always laugh at those that say that because they're the same people that bitch and moan about fat shaming and how being fat is "beautiful" and "strong" but they don't hold back when they make fun of "skinny bitches" or how "men don't like bones"   A big part of it since obesity is so normalized, anything less than the average person is any country where obesity is rampant looks "unhealthy""
Sacramento,"I mean people like to say this and that about why Sacramento gets a bad rap but in my opinion the truth of the matter is it is a GREAT city with no access to beaches in a state that's...known for it's beaches. People generally associate CA with the beach, many people associate the high prices of CA is due to the ability to live near a beach.   An equivalent of Sacramento would be if there was some hypothetical city in western New York that had the most gorgeous mountain range on the East Coast, the best campgrounds, excellent weather and one of the best freshwater lakes in the country. Now if you were from this city and went to say Manhattan, people would probably feel sorry for you and say your city sucks because NY is known for the big city and if you are anywhere but in the big city in NY it must suck right?"
GreenBayPackers,"Thornton has hardly looked good this preseason.  He reminds me of a gap stuffing nose tackle in a 4-3.  When he does get penetration he either gets too deep in the backfield or he lacks the speed to properly pursue the ball carrier."
GreenBayPackers,"IN DEFENSE of the Bucs... their offensive coordinator is actually their QB coach. This was supposed to be his first ever year coaching anything EVER at the NFL level, and it was to be QB coaching only. In preseason however, the Bucs OC got terribly sick (cancer I believe) and went to the hospital. It was expected he was going to return to the team by regular season but he decided to step down permanently and this guy the Bucs have now is that QB coach. I feel really bad for him because I'm sure he did like 0 prep expecting to run the entire team's offense for the entire year. Even if he did do some prep work it's his first ever year at the NFL level."
Showerthoughts,"Uh, I played bagpipes in competition for years at Scottish games. I had to wear not just a kilt, but the whole shebang.

I had trouble at first, but you get used to it fast. The  real  secret is no underwear. If you wear underwear it fucks everything up.   Pissing is easy, just lift, grab, and spray. No toilet available? No problem! Indian squat on the ground, move the kilt out of the way and spray!  Taking a shit? Easy! Using a toilet: just lift the back of the kilt, wrap forward and dump away. No toilet? No problem! Same steps as pissing, just bring toilet paper!   Too cold in the winter? Please. Winter socks! They're extra thick, made of wool. If your kilt is the proper length it should be just covering your knees, meeting the socks. Essentially fully covering you. Too hot in the summer? Summer kilt+summer socks. They're significantly thinner, and so is the kilt, usually made of cotton or another breathable material.   You should treat your uniform like tires, there's winter tires and summer tires. Yes, there is all season, but in reality it sucks equally for both scenarios instead of being good for both."

Showerthoughts,"Similar story, when I was in 1st grade, I had to walk past a house on the way to the bus. The owners had 2 huge German Shepherds, and they'd always rush the fence and bark at me. They also had softballs as chew toys, and the balls were always covered in slobber and blood.   Fucking terrified me for months.   Then one day, the owners were outside, real nice couple in their 50's. They asked if I wanted to come in and meet the dogs, since I was so obviously scared. For some reason I agreed, and the second I walked in, they both calmly walked up, dropped their softballs, and licked me to death. We played fetch for a while, they got some belly rubs, and I went on my way.   Those dogs got a pat on the head every day after that."

Poetry,"Beware the advice of anyone who tells you to  absolutely not  do/use something, or that you  must  do/use something:   The other shoe Oh if it were only the other shoe hanging in space before joining its mate. If the undropped didn't congregate with the undropped. But nothing can stop the mid-air collusion of the unpaired above us acquiring density and weight. We feel it accumulate.    --Kay Ryan   The point is to know that you're using those things and why. How do you use them? Are they being used as shortcuts to an idea (bad! poetry is never a shortcut) or as a way towards the deepening of an idea (good!)?   If there's no radar in a poem, why are you talking about radar? If there's not a mechanistic device or a biological contrast, why are you talking about a "well-oiled machine"? Is it merely the first thing that popped into your head? (Did it actually  POP  or, was it there already and you simply rolled it into place?)   Someone said to me recently, paraphrasing: "What's  it  doing?" "How are you  using  it?"   Cliches are like anything else previously established, there's a comfortable power in its familiarity and warmth but鈥攊n contrast鈥攁 dangerous laziness when the writer relies on it unthinkingly.   Also, remember that poetry is not always written from the point of view of the author/writer/poet... oftentimes the speaker is a character in the poem. Would that character think to use anything other than a cliche? Does the reader know the speaker a character? etc etc etc... poetry is infinitely cool."
legaladvice,"After reviewing the causes of action in which we are acting upon I believe it would not be in my best interest to settle the case without just compensation.  In the original petition we were suing for,   >1. Return of vehicle per Texas Business & Commerce Code 2A.519;   >2. Actual damages;   >3.  Statutory damages;   >4. Exemplary and punitive damages;   >5. Attorney's fees in an amount not less than $5000.00;   >6. Costs of suit; and   >7. Such other relief to which Plaintiff may show himself entitled;   >I filed suit with no intentions of ever doing business with * Infiniti again. With 9+ causes of action, and many examples of evidence that they acted maliciously or with ill intent, I believe we have a solid case that should be pursued. I do not want this business to profit in any way from this transaction, and many variables since September, 28th 2011 have changed that do not merit entering into the same deal with the dealership.   >1.    Having been almost 5 months, the car has depreciated greatly since the time of signing the lease. I entered into the contract with the intent to lease and keep a new vehicle, not to lease and have stolen from my possession for four months, and then returned.   >2.  I would not have taken the time to file a lawsuit for a deal that was afterwards brought to my attention to be fraudulent. The dealership would not have been willing to work with me, if I at a later date discovered that the price I purchased the car at was vastly different than the price I was originally shown on my first visit to the dealership on 9/20/2011   >3. The botched deal in this arrangement has caused much grief in my family; my grandparents should not be put through potentially the same trouble as before and have to bear through even more lies by the dealership.  Their original signature that they will testify to should be the only one needed, and I will not strain my relationship with them even more by asking for another.   >4. I have had individuals from other car dealerships through casual conversation comment on how Crest had no grounds to repossess the vehicle after a signed agreement was made, and that I should end up owning the car.   >5.  With the level of humiliation, intimidation, and verbal degradation Crest Infiniti used through the course of our transaction, I do not see how anyone would be expected to enter into another transaction and allow the place of business to profit off said transaction. The dealership will make money on the car, regardless of reducing the price to invoice as car dealerships get kickbacks on financing.   > With their reckless use of my and my grandfather's credit information I cannot insure that I will not encounter more issues in the future even if the current inquiries can be removed. They without my permission used my credit information after I was informed that I had been approved with Infiniti Financial. They then showed my private credit information to parties unrelated to the original transaction without my permission.   >With these variables I feel that by resuming the transaction, and acting like the events never happened would only cause me to lose out. They were given multiple chances before to resolve the issue and did not do so.  I have spent additional time and money pursuing this case, and feel that even in civil claims court there would be more compensation then just having the original deal returned to me.   >I believe that the whole conversation between my grandmother and Infiniti financial is not factual. There is no way that this was my grandmother, and she will even testify to the fact that this was not her, plus she was with us at the dealership on the day we signed the contract and assisted with the credit application. She even submitted her own signature to the dealership to become a cosigner herself when they rejected me and my grandfather together. Even at that, the issue was between the finance company and the dealership and with a signed contract and the cashing of my check I believe the deal should've been set in stone regardless of the issues they encountered on their end.  The spot delivery agreement was expired when they contacted me to get the car back, and even at that it was not correctly filled out so therefore should be invalid.   >I am interested in what you would recommend to be a counter offer to the dealership, excluding resuming a lease transaction with them. I am still open to settlement talks with the dealership as a show of good faith, even though I have doubts any results would be obtained by talks with the man that previously talked with such contempt towards me before I filed suit. I feel that it would only be a method for them to try and intimidate me into a decision that would be of benefit to them. But, I am not against attempting to do so as a matter of record for the court.   >Best Regards, *   She has not even tried with this suit, my attorney literally filed papers that I would not be beyond filing, and when they offered to pay her fees decided to bail."

legaladvice,"My experience with LegalShield has all been in having to undo problems caused by people who relied on it when they should have called a lawyer first. In my experience, LegalShield and those charge a fair amount for their product, but don't provide the analysis and personalized attention that a lawyer looking at your situation provides."
legaladvice,"So he didn't allow you to use his copyrighted material in your video (he told you you would have to pay for it) but you used it anyway without permission?   That is copyright infringement.  Sure, that guy infringed on the original artist, but his infringement doesn't give you the right to infringe.  When someone creates a derivative work (modifying another song or copyrighted work and creating a new work) that person owns a copyright in that derivative work.  They don't own the original, but they do own the work they added to it.   So in shorthand:   Artist A creates work.  Guy B, creates a work and tells you (C) you need to license it.  If C doesn't pay B (which he told you you needed to), B can sue C for infringement.  However, A can still sue B for infringement, and C for that matter.  Even if A sues B, B still has a claim against C."
legaladvice,"I'm a little old-fashioned about this, but as I've gotten older and wiser I've become disinterested in one-night stands etc., partly because of what you're talking about here.   Most people who have something to hide can't hide it for very long. Movies and books where someone hides a fundamental part of their personality (e.g. being completely nuts) aren't indicative of reality - it's REALLY HARD to suppress something like that. Most people can't do it for very long. My bare minimum for considering someone for romance is six months, preferably longer.   That's not to say I'm not a little flirty, but again, it's only after you've known someone for a few months that they start to show hints of who they really are. That fact usually gets swept up in the infatuation that people mistake for real affection."
legaladvice,"I'm a landlord in Texas, not Georgia so any specific Georgia laws are unknown to me and hopefully a lawyer will be around shortly, but it's really late.   Your lease allows them access for this, so they can legally come in and inspect. They cannot go through your belongings but can open pantries, closets, etc and inspect for damage. Every landlord I know does this monthly, usually when I do I simply make a quick lap around and make pets haven't eaten window sills, no water leaks etc. You might be the perfect tenant, but most aren't and most don't report "minor" problems that are or can lead to huge problems.   I can't imagine this is actually going to be an invasive search as much as a "yep, the building is still here", especially since this isn't university affiliated housing."
legaladvice,"It's admirable that you want to help your friend, but you could be doing him harm by falsely interpreting the rules. Universities do not have to function like the US legal system and often afford you less rights. Even if you would be found not guilty in a court of law, the university can still expel you if you're found in violation of a number of codes they may set forth.   Unfortunately for your friend, universities tend to rule in favor of the female victim in the vast majority of cases brought before them. Sexual assault is taken incredibly seriously in this day and age and it's a situation the school will likely be familiar with. Similarly, if you are too drunk to consent to sex, you can be convicted of rape in Texas. Prior consent does not indicate consent at the time the intercourse takes place, they could have had intercourse a number of times and had a strictly sexual relationship with a large amount of evidence proving that, but what occurred could still be considered rape.   While the school may be a major concern, your friend will be in a lot more trouble if the case becomes a criminal issue as well. I'd recommend seeking out a lawyer if he can afford it, or contacting whatever legal assistance your school may offer. In a large enough university, there may be free legal counsel available. Please do not rely too heavily on yourself as a witness or legal advisor, only a true lawyer can help and you may end up accidentally digging your friend into a bigger hole due to lack of familiarity with the rules e.g. laws regarding consent."
MyLittleSupportGroup,"The best way to start meeting people, regardless of age, is to pursue an interest of yours in some group setting. Whether it be a high school or college club, or even just a group meeting in your local area. Finding a public group to engage your interests should be your first step. If you don't have such a hobby, start experimenting with new hobbies. Though the internet isn't the best place to foster lasting friendships, it can provide some inspiration for activities where you can meet such people.   Once you do manage to find such a group, focus on enjoying the activity with the others around you. Talk about your shared interest. Generate small talk. Ask about what they do outside of the group or what else they enjoy. With the interaction over time, you'll start to gravitate towards people that 'mesh' with you. The key point will be if a potential friend asks you to do something with them outside of the group (have a beer, go see a sports game, etc.). A key indicator of a friendship is being to be able to do multiple activities with a person and still enjoy their company. Also, if you enjoy someone's company in your group, you could also try to invite them to do something.   However, the problem appears to be that your standard of people you would want to befriend excludes the people you know. There are people that fit snuggly into these descriptions you've listed, but there are more  people that once you get to know them have alot more depth past these cookie-cutter stereotypes that you have identified. The fact of the matter is that you will never find the 'friend' that will meet all your criteria. You're friends will be the select few that you are willing to make allowances for, people that may not live up to your expectations but are great enough that you will see past their flaws. The only way to meet such people is to try, try, try. Not every interaction with a potential friend will end with one being made. But, what do you lose in the scheme of things by trying? No skin off your back if you try and it doesn't work out. You just keep having to make such attempts until it does pay off.   You also make the request that people forgive you for being imperfect, that request is a two-way street. You have to be willing to forgive others for their flaws for them to be willing to do the same for you. You need to internalize that idea, because people will always fall flat of some expectation eventually.   so,"
singapore,"Thinking back, my NS journey was very laid back, not a lot of tekan sessions, or not fierce at all. The most memorable one however, was during BMT.   It was the first book-in after confinement week. As we all know, supper was served during confinement week for transition.  At Pasir Ris Int, the whole company was being rowdy, loud, just not listening to the specs to form up nicely. Back at Coy line, a PC made us all do push-ups, crunches, run around cluster, the works man. Dude, we were in Smart 4, nice boots and with all our book in stuff.   I swear it lasted about 20, 30 minutes. It was what, close to 10pm, I was so worried there wouldn't be enough time to shower and unpack everything. But then he stopped, and before giving RO, he ask if anyone had anything to say. The epic moment comes here. This cock in my platoon, raised his arm meekly, and asked loudly:   "SIR, TODAY GOT NIGHT SNACK ANOT?"   The look on his face and the whole company's was PRICELESS man. You could hear a pin drop, the silence. Oh my god I swore I face-palmed at that moment.   The PC then just ignored his question and went on to give RO.   Best. Moment. Ever. More of a joke, rather than shag.   EDIT: I think the worst was one where I gave this LCP in my platoon a horrible time."
singapore,"Singapore is amazing! Singaporeans are also amazing. Sometimes, you meet people who say things that may sound prejudiced/insulting, but don't let them or hateful online forums make you forget that fact.  I think that Singapore gives you what you bring to it. I have heard loads of people complain about feeling cagey here but the way I see it, there is just so much to do and so much to see that one could never actually get bored here.  People are kind and nice if you try to talk to them. I think that not many people try to be friendly because almost everyone is reserved - but if you take the opportunity to strike up a conversation with your taxi uncle or the hawker centre aunty, you will learn that they all have fascinating stories to tell. Also, the city is beautiful. Do go and explore all the parks and things. It's easy to get sucked into a mall-visiting-spiral because the malls are just so comfortable compared to the heat outside. But that would be a terrible waste because the city has a lot to offer. And most important of all, something that I always try to remember when things get a bit rough is this quote - " 鈥淏e kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle." The city is small and immigrants like you and I are helping it economically but we are also putting a lot of pressure on the infrastructure and the socioeconomic situation due to our sheer numbers. People have very hectic and stressful work lives and long commutes and a million other things to juggle. So if anyone is rude or unkind, remember that they probably just had a bad day and don't let that be the thing that you remember the city by."
CODZombies,"I think things that make maps not as enjoyable as the original maps is the focus on Easter eggs and tasks in the newer maps being more important than survival. If there was a campaign, then tasks and missions in these maps would be fine. When they distract from the core gameplay and make large, difficult maps that are more focused on story than zombie killing, suddenly all of the maps need to be almost too large for just four players and overcomplicated. I like the smaller maps that fit 4 players to keep the mayhem going. Making the perks or power just a challenge to access discourages me in particular from wanting to play those kinda of Maps. However, I quite enjoyed Mob of the Dead, as it was really forward with the mission at hand, and far more self explanatory. The items list on screen is very useful, and there isn't way too much to handle."
CODZombies,"I've thinking about this for a long time...   I want zombies to head in the direction that makes camping more viable then running circles. I find it more fun to camp by far compared to running circles. Circles are easy and super boring to run. I find my camping run to 46 was much more fun then running circles and traping to round 70.   I don't think traps are needed, they just make for endless games and dont require to much skill to really use once the easy strategies start rolling out. Instead of traps I think it would be better to have a multiple PaP level system where every time you upgrade your weapon it gets stronger but also cost alot more to upgrade again. This would make it require a certain amount of skill to get the higher tier guns but also you a rewarded by being able to kill zombies in the higher rounds much more efficiently, which goes back to me liking camping maps more.   I hate/love the same wall weapon around the map, I like the idea of having multiple ammo spots for a gun but hate the fact that it cuts down the amount of different guns we can buy off the wall. Also every gun thats been in Black Ops 2 Zombies (other then wonder weapons) should be in  the box. I would love it if there was like 30+ guns in the box.   No gameplay changing easter egg stuff, I love the idea of there being a hidden back story and you had the option to figure it out if you wanted to. But now its just turned into an achievement hunt type of thing or you get people wanted to do it for what you get at the end. This just makes playing the game take longer, and it already takes to long to get to 60+. I'm glad you dont get all perks that dont go away like moon, thats just OP.   And last but not least the map its self should be 1 easy to navigate map. Mob of the Dead was the first to do this right for BO2 both Tranzit's bus system and the Die Rise elevator ruined the maps for me. I dont want have to wait for something I have absolutely no control over. The gondola is fine because you dont have to depend on it."
CrappyDesign,"Besides the fact that it looks like a sex toy, this is crappy design because the user would have to pick up and hold each "bead" to connect or disconnect a device, and it wouldn't consistently stay upright with ports accessible because the bottom isn't flat.

classicalmusic,"Well, I hadn't heard that about the design of the LP.   The original 78s could hold 4 minutes of music per side (I have been told that this may be responsible for short pop singles).   Then there were the 33 1/3, which could do 11 minutes per side   Victor took the rotation speed and increased time to 15 minutes a side   Columbia soon developed a way to hold 20 minutes a side   CBS followed up with 78 rpm and 22.5 minutes a side, which is about where technological development ended.   So, you know what, looking at the Beethoven symphonies, I'm wondering if there were cases where the first two movements would fit onto the disk only if a repeat wasn't taken to save an extra 2 minutes.   There are numerous ways to increase the amount of time you have on an LP, and numerous tradeoffs you need to take into account when doing so.  You can make the grooves smaller, so there's more recording surface, but this loses fidelity and may hurt your needle.  You can equalize in such a way as you remove a bunch of frequencies, which again hurts fidelity but allows longer recording time."
hcfactions,"I would suggest possibly a limit to the level you can enchant and making it a level 20 max with protection 2 being turned into protection 1 if you get it.This would let people get optimal enchants on there gear much quicker.With this in place there could be the mob limit plugin put in that would only allow you to have x amount of mobs in 1 chunk.It might still cause a little lag but thats the reason for donations and upgrading server hardware :p.I mean what server can run 20 tick rate 100% of the time with 0 lag on a crazy high FPS non stop, its a nice goal but it can't possibly be achieved without a insane hardware for the server or removing some natural elements of the game.Now getting back to the part of enchants....being able to enchant at level 30 only and a max armor enchant of prot 1 would solve a lot of things.Unlike a set of full protection 2 protection 1 can be gotten at level 1 and dose not max out the amount of EPF you can have.This causes more damage to be taken and less time to enchant.Now to get on to tools, at level 30 tool enchants you can grab your basic silk touch and i believe up to unbreaking 3 and efficiency 3.As for fortune enchant level 1 would be common level 2 would be rare and level 3 would be VERY RARE I'm talking 0.24% chance rare.People may say "But now we can't get enough diamonds" well your sort of wrong sort of right, With protection weekend it won't absorb much damage = less damage to your armor and getting more bang for you diamonds which ultimately = less diamonds.As for the rest of things you use diamonds on you won't waste 400 diamond son swords that you keep going for a OP sharp V fire 2 looting 3 that you have a 1.24% chance of getting.This would ultimately lower the same game stats to what it is now on a more noob friendly level.Sharpness 3 is the highest sharpness possible at that level and a sharpness 3 fire 2 is only 3.98% at level 30, going back to the sharp V fire 2 looting 3 god sword its about the same % as getting a sharp 3 fire 2 looting 3 at level 30.Add a few potion delays and maybe instant health 2 again and over all this would be a nice noob friendly add on :).(Bows would need a nerd though as they already can deal about 6.5 hearts to prot 2 in prot 1 thats a 1 hit)   Now to the problem of getting more people to events.Events of course would have to have a tone down in mob damage and rewards.Some things that could be good would be getting a fortune 3 possibly or maybe just maybe a sharp 4 fire 2.(this seems op to protection 1 but believe me coming from a server were there was no grinding and people had 1 sword they loved for life they got from donating this being a sharp V prot 1 let you live and win if you knew what you were doing)Another big prize at this point i would say would also be ender pearls since looting 3 would be the best looting you could get and it only having a 3% chance would be very good for a lot of factions that go through a stack a fight.With rewards that are good editions to even the newest of teams that a lot of new played could compete for would be very strongly to adding more action in events."

TumblrInAction,"Because it gives them a noble cause to get behind. Notice most of them are also young adults -- I think they're the same kind of people we see here on TiA. Young people looking for something with which to define themselves. Some people do it by subscribing and coining new labels, others do it by finding something to fight for (exemplified in just how successful army recruitment is when they market to young adults).   It's not so much about seeing it as a competition so much as seeing all the injustice in society while you're still young and angry with the world. There's an energy and a drive to fix  every little thing  about us as a species because otherwise it's a failure on your part, because you weren't good enough to change everything. That's why we see so much Rorschach-esque black-and-white thinking with SRS. Either you're against all these little flaws, or you must condone or support them and therefore you're part of the problem, intellectual equality and internal consistency be damned.   I surmise that even in a society where tolerance were ubiquitous and there were no systemic oppression to be found, they would find a new problem to fix. Some of them are finding new problems every day, many of which are idioms which are misinterpreted, usually intentionally so, by the SJW so as to have a new target to attack and feel satisfied in defeating.   Case in point: I've seen them say the conversational use of "man or woman" is offensive because it enforces the gender binary. (85% of SRS identify as cisgendered -- another 9% are questioning. Meanwhile, [99.998% of people globally identify as either a man or a woman.](   I've seen them say the idiom "I'll give it to you straight" is offensive because it's homophobic ("straight" meant "without twists or turns"  long  before it meant "heterosexual").   The word "lame" as the opposite of "cool" is ableist (that usage actually originated in the 20th century to describe someone who dances badly; nobody uses this word and thinks of a disabled person outside of the frickin' Bible, and nobody wanting to insult a disabled person thinks of this word).   Saying a trans* is "biologically male/female" is transphobic because it implies they have some obligation to fill that role (they also said they don't even know how you'd convey the same thing in an inoffensive way; at least they're being consistent).   You've even more recently got that Anita Sarkeesian cacophony where having a male lead save a female in a video game is sexist, and when the vice is versa, it's either empowering, or worse, irrelevant. They believe that one side is "oppressed" and the other isn't, and the majority is above being offended. Convenient for feminists like them, since it enables categorical insults based on how someone was born, if you're born into a social majority. They can say it's not hypocrisy because it does no real harm, a retort that runs conspicuously parallel to their detractors who say that offensive jokes do no harm. It underscores their mentality on social justice issues. Good vs. bad. Black vs. white.   So it's part gloryhounding, part desperation, part reckless moral crusade. Honestly, I can understand why anyone would get behind this kind of movement. But at the same time, it's pretty undeniably toxic and trigger-happy when it comes to who and what they castigate, and how heavy they do it. Like I said, it's all black-and-white, and everyone wants a ticket on the trainwreck."
TumblrInAction,"Someone got in an argument with a guy on SRD the other day about the way kickstarter is ran. The guy used Sarks kickstarter as an example to kind of a flaw in the system.

TumblrInAction,"white males   well, while something around [41%]( of all homeless people in america are white, and about 60% of them are male,  only approximately  15 % of chronically homeless people are white.   and while a majority of homeless people are male, a 60% proportion of the total homeless population compared to a ~49% proportion of the overall population doesn't suggest the same kind of prevalence as, say, queer youth.  with a homelessness rate somewhere between [20% and 45%]( compared to a 5% to 10% rate in the overall population, homelessness is much more of a queer/youth issue than it is a men's issue, at least in terms of disproportionate representation in the homeless population.   I think that this is more of a case where both the SJW and 'talking fedora' are wrong, or at least misunderstand the concept of privilege: while men might be privileged as a general, statistical group, homeless gay youth, or middle-age, mentally ill men who can't work or function in society are  disprivileged  in comparison to the general population, male  and  female, because class (wealth) and sexuality convey far,  far  more privilege than gender ever could."
TumblrInAction,"The fact that you just said that made me realize something. The girl in the comments saying that what the two girls in the status said wasn't racist is white (she said so " we  are the privileged"). I've heard PoC state that racism makes some PoC hate the color of their skin and become racist against their own race. This makes sense that racism against your race could ultimately make you hate your own race because it's ingrained in you that your race is bad. All these SJW's are standing by being white is bad. If you are white you are horrible and a racist and talking out against remarks made to "prove" you are an awful racist person makes you more racist. And don't even get them started if you are a straight white male."

TumblrInAction,"I dunno. I went to community college my freshman year and planned on getting my associates before heading off to a four year for my bachelor's. So i tried to take all the gen eds that I could. They ALSO had a public speaking requirement, and to this day it was the only class I just stopped going to.   I'm an introvert. I'm the textbook definition of introvert - it's not that I dislike people, it's that I need to spend a lot of time on my own to recharge from being around the people that I love. I'll even get sick of my boyfriend every once in a while and need to just chill in my room with a warm blanket and a book. I am also cripplingly shy.   This class was awful. The professor was so full of himself and picked favorites almost right away and I wasn't one of them. I tried to keep up with the work - writing banal speeches about the importance of smoke detectors type stuff - but then he would make us get up in front of the room. Again, it's a public speaking class, but that wasn't the worst.   The worst was that he would sit right in front of you, and instead of using words, used one of those clickers for dog training. Too quiet?  click  not enunciating?  click  Voice trembling?  click   He didn't give you verbal criticism. He just tallied up how many clicks you got. And the more shy you were, the worse the clicks made you. It was dehumanizing. He was training you like he trained a dog.   The most upsetting part? I was coming from a minor theater background. I'd taken theater classes at a drama school for five years before then. I can speak my lines on stage perfectly. It's just something about speaking in front of my peers academically takes all the wind out of my sails and makes me hyperventilate and want to cry.

TumblrInAction,"I also agree with the jist of her post, or at least can understand her emotions. Especially because she's obviously young and maybe hasn't been outside of her comfort zone in the world very often.   I've travelled with people who have said and done offensive, douchey things, and I know that in my travels I've surely said and done offensive, douchey things. I've had the good fortune to be able to get myself around in the world a little bit, and when I look back I definitely see some blunders I've made, whether they arose from being too gung ho about something or too careful. Because until you know any better, you don't know any better.   Her frustration with her travel group is real and understandable, and it's part projection and part insecurity. "Oh my god, look at all of these ignorant Americans who don't know what they're doing!" She's distancing herself because she realizes, ok, so maybe I am also an ignorant American who doesn't always know what I'm doing, but now I see this and I know that I don't want to be like that. Wanting to disassociate from your privilege spotlight but realizing that you are on a study abroad sponsored tour...being invited to move to the front of the line by local people but knowing what goes through your head when you see those fuckers with their "Move To The Front Of The Line" Passes at six flags get on the roller coaster for the third time when you haven't even made it up the steps of the line yet...a lot of hypocrisy and conflict to deal with.   Coming from a place of relative privilege and doing most of my travelling in developing countries as a young adult during and post college, it was hard to come face to face with the special treatment I got. Was it because I'm white and therefore everyone must do what I say because I'm all-powerful? No. Was it because my white skin made me an obvious guest in a foreign land where people take pride in how they treat visitors? Almost without exception, yes. Day one of my time in [insert fancy travel destination here], it felt pretty horrifying to have the biggest chunk of meat put in my dish while the little old lady who spent all day preparing my food got none of it...but I hazard to say she was just as horrified when I tried to give it back. With time and practice and exposure and mistakes and laughter and learning, I got better at being a good guest and better at asserting myself appropriately as a member of the community. Towards the end of my stay in [I'm so well traveled], I served mama the best chunk of meat  and  I washed the damn dishes afterwards."
TumblrInAction,"The reference to standard English was, I believe, with regard to written language. I agree with you that spoken language must only be coherent to the target audience to be "valid", and I suppose the same argument could be made for written language. However, writing has generally been more formal and codified than spoken language, especially in formal settings. While minor points of grammar or spelling differ between the English skating populations of the world, there is a generally agreed upon standard. As for spoken language, while I've touched on the validity of aave or any other dialect, a formal spoken dialect is generally expected in business, etc. This is why code switching is a thing."
TumblrInAction,"Eh, I genuinely think that it has less to do with being weak-willed and more to do with issues that were not really relevant prior to the advancement of technology and the abundance of resources that we have now in modern western society (food, specifically).   People always had the ability to be huge fatasses if they had the resources to reach that point, which for a long time we really didn't, as a society. Food was seen as fuel for the day, not something that is mostly always around.   I don't buy into the weak-willed stuff. You either care about your appearance or you don't, those who do fall into three categories and those who don't well, generally only fall into one.   Care: Are healthy, or aren't healthy and don't know how to resolve it (genuinely have no idea how to diet), or aren't healthy and have no ability to stop it (depression, other psychological diseases, compulsion, and so on).   Don't care: You really only get mentally ill here. If you genuinely don't give a shit about your health  at all , huge issues.   The people who would lose a bunch of weight in a structured environment and then gain it back, most likely fall into the latter of the three under 'Care' - most likely compulsion.   Eating stuff to them is like smoking a cigarette or checking their email or biting their nails or throwing up (for some people, anyway). Its something that they know they must not do consciously, but the urge is strong.   It really is exactly like craving a cigarette, good analogy me. Being that I have a few compulsive issues, I can relate a little.   Now, nobody should think people are any worse for having these issues, I mean they're just people with problems and the harm falls on them, there's just no reason to.   The main issue is with tumblrinas who advocate this lifestyle and who respond aggressively to criticism, while advocating their culture of unhealthy activity. That is messed up and can potentially harm others, some who may have lost hope."
TumblrInAction,"They don't want to explain it. There was an  article  a few years back.   > Colour-blind racists feed on good-faith debate, and engaging with them, especially online, is almost always futile.

TumblrInAction,"I still don't get why they use the word privilege as such a terrible, horrible insult?   I (maybe foolishly?) studied Sociology when I was in undergrad. It's where all the pretty girls were and very few guys, and it had a Public Health concentration that I was interested in. Anyways, it's common for certain groups and people to have privileges, because not everybody is exactly the same. That's how life works. Having a privilege is not, in of itself, a terrible condemnation on the person you are. What you do with that privilege or how you act IS a determining factor of who you are.   I'm a white, heterosexual male who grew up in upper-middle class and I have been able to become educated through my hard work and the support of my family, financial or otherwise. I have privileges that other people do not, but I don't hold those over others, because I realize that it just means I need to work harder to deserve the good fortune I have. Instead, I try to learn from others, treat all people kindly and respectfully, and do the best I can with what tools I have to make the world a better place.   Most tumblrinas would tell me I'm a horrible person because I have a privilege and dare to try to learn from others. Based on that, I don't think even they really understand what they're trying to do."

TumblrInAction,"I don't think it's fair to generalize that widely. The same thing gets said of bisexuals all the time, that they're "just doing it for attention", and in my experience some people who claim that label are just saying that for one reason or another, but you can't say because of that everyone is.   I'm 28. I have an active social life, friends, and currently a boyfriend. I've done quite a bit of dating in the last 10 years, and I've identified as asexual for the last 3. I have one other friend who is the same way - very attractive girl, very social, gets asked out frequently and turns them down 90% of the time, because she's identified as asexual since before Tumblr existed. It happens."
TumblrInAction,"Although most Tumblrinas phrase it like a petulant little child, there actually is (some) truth to this.   Making fun of a man for feminine qualities IS sexist against women, because it implies that feminine qualities are undesirable.   Making fun of a woman for masculine qualities is also sexist against women, as it implies that women can't have certain qualities because they 'belong to men'.   However, that's usually where they stop. They fail to realize that:   Making fun of a man for feminine qualities is ALSO sexist against MEN, as it implies that men can't have certain qualities because they 'belong to women'.   Making fun of a woman for masculine qualities is also sexist against men, because it implies that masculine qualities are undesirable.   Admittedly, I can't stand the term 'sexist against'. I used it for clarity in the above argument, but something can't be 'sexist against' or 'racist against' or 'ableist against'. It either is sexist, racist or ableist, or it isn't. If something is sexist, it applies to BOTH SEXES (or all sexes, depending where you stand on the whole gender binary, something I'm not even going to touch).   If something is sexist 'against' a woman, chances are it's also sexist 'against' a man. It's just 'sexist'. That's it.   Someone tells a female rape victim that it's her fault because she was wearing a miniskirt?   That's sexist as hell, but no, it's not sexist 'against' women. Yes, it implies that a woman is responsible for her attack because of the way she looked, but it ALSO implies that men are rampant sexual animals that can't control their actions when they see an inch of a girl's upper thigh. Sexism is a two-sided coin.   Misandry, and misogyny, however ARE one sided, but should not be freely swapped with the word sexist.   Someone says "Custody of a child should always go to the mother no matter the circumstances"? Misandry.   "Women shouldn't be allowed to vote" Yeah that's pretty misogynistic.   "She was raped because of what she was wearing" Surprise! That's actually sexist because it implies negative things about both men and women!"

First things first, ignoring the "echo system" thing, yes, in order to build in Minecraft there is some level of environmental destruction required, but the beauty of Minecraft is that you can fix it. Chop down 20 trees to make room for your house? You can plant 50 more! Or not. It doesn't matter because Minecraft isn't real! And on the male protagonist part, a second protagonist was added, named Alex. Alex has a gender-neutral name for a reason. The original creator of Minecraft explicitly said that he does not want Minecraft to be a gendered game. Even Alex's appearance can be interpreted as either way. Before that, you could change your skin any time you wanted, for FREE! Be a man, be a woman, be a boy, be a girl, be a fucking penguin, nobody gives a shit!

TumblrInAction,"Medical student here. Let's break this down a little bit:   >excuses surgeons give for not wanting to operate on fat patients is about never having bothered to learn to do so safely.   Surgeons spend 4 years in medical school, 5 years in a residency program, and then an extra few years if they want to specialize. All that training is necessary to make sure they can do surgeries well and, most importantly, safely. This is fucking offensive to those who actually go down this path in their medical career.   >Never having developed solid anesthesia guidelines,   General anesthetics work by going into lipid-rich areas and staying there, including your brain. The more lipid-rich areas in the body, the more anesthetic will be stored there. The more anesthetic stored in your body, the longer it takes for the patient to wake up from anesthesia. The longer it takes for the patient to wake up, the more dangerous it is. Anesthesiologists goal is to use the minimum amount of anesthesia to get the patient under, keep the patient under, and bring the patient back as fast as possible. Having a shit-ton of fat in your body makes the anesthesia A LOT more unpredictable and an anesthesiologists job that much more difficult.   >never having trained on fat corpses in meds school,   Does she mean cadaveric dissections or actually treating fat people? I've seen dissections on larger cadavers during my anatomy course. However, surgeons don't train on cadavers, they train on actual patients and there are PLENTY of obese patients for them to train on. It's actually very common to see obese patients at the hospital I train at.   >never having developed the tools to hold fatty tissue out of the way.   Haven't done my surgery rotation yet so I don't fully know this answer, but I think surgeons have been able to figure out ways to navigate around fat given that more than a third of the US population is obese and the obese people  tend  to see the doctors more (I wonder why?).   On top of all of this, OP is talking about getting a breast reduction, an  ENTIRELY ELECTIVE SURGERY . OF COURSE, the surgeon wants her to lose some weight before the surgery. There's no need for the procedure to be rushed, so the surgeon wants the patient to be in the most ideal condition for the surgery to go well. This would be entirely different if OP had to receive surgery for a serious medical issue."
TumblrInAction,"It wouldn't be as diverse as the world actually is. Making all of these characters ace really would take away from characterization possibilities.   You could possibly make Harry bi with a preference for women. That's as far from straight as I would take it. Charlie could possibly be aromantic because he seems to like dragons more, but wasn't he a bit of a flirt in school? I wouldn't call him asexual, tbh.   The majority of the population is straight, there's no changing that. A lot of people want to ignore that in their headcanons and not pay attention to how the characters truly are.   It's like certain trans headcanons that have no basis in canon. If they haven't shown anything that resembles dysphoria, then it should just be accepted maybe that character is perfectly fine with being cis. Their canon shouldn't be morphed for the sake of a 'headcanon.' Alternate universes, perhaps, but not headcanons."
entertainment,"No. I've stated from the beginning that I believe Clash has a share of the blame here. Whether he's 1% or 100% at fault. All I ask is for people to consider the facts which DO point to him having at least some share of the blame.   It's the total ignorance of those jumping on the bandwagon to fully support him that's sad. Just because he's a celebrity.   As a celebrity, you DO NOT publicly settle like this. I firmly believe this second accuser is being an opportunist, BUT for Kevin to settle in the first place and then resign immediately after the second accuser gives a lot of merit to their claims!   The second accuser very well may have had underage sex with Clash, but I doubt that if he did he was ever "troubled" by it.   I believe Clash's willingness to first settle, then resign, means to me that there is incriminating evidence somewhere, and possibly MORE accusers that will be coming forward.   If you were 100% innocent in the first place, WHY settle when  as a celebrity  you are inviting copycat accusers?"
entertainment,"What would  you  do?   What would any of us do?   What would a celebrity do, who has access to top lawyers and publicists?   Any publicist worth a damn would have advised him NOT to settle  after the first accusation was made public . As a celebrity, maybe it would have been worthwhile to settle  before  it became public to prevent anyone from talking to the press, just to prevent a PR nightmare. That stuff happens all the time, especially with celebrity divorces and things not involving these current allegations.   BUT, once this shit was made public, any publicist or lawyer would have advised NOT to settle if you were innocent, because it gives your public accuser credibility.   Now this second accuser comes along, which again any lawyer or publicist for someone famous and with lots of money would have expected. "Hey, this rich guy is giving out free money!" And copy-cats come out of the woodwork.   How does Clash respond?   He  resigns .   Makes you wonder what evidence is out there, how many more accusers will come forth, etc. You might have 100 accusers come forth now, with 99 of them  lying through their teeth . All it takes is just one with some evidence.   Which is why  if  Clash were 100% innocent, he should have never settled in the first place."
entertainment,"Oh yes! I'll stream of consciousness as much as I can remember. About ten years ago I read an article about Lisa McPherson and I couldn't stop reading and clicking after that. It's some incredibly fascinating shit. Here goes.   First start with [L. Ron Hubbard]( himself. Essential reading. He's one of the most charismatic motherfuckers ever to walk the Earth. He claimed to be the youngest ever Eagle Scout or some shit. Even a nuclear physicist. Also a navy ship captain and war hero. The list goes on. But people believed it. Who could verify it back then anyway? Seriously. I know there's a TON of stuff on that wiki, but here's why it's all worth reading.   At the end of all of this, you will have a shitload of knowledge about how easily people can be manipulated and used and how to avoid situations and people like that. And also have read some seriously crazy ass shit about a crazy ass cult. If you've done your homework on Hubbard, then follow me.   (also, you'll eventually need this: [dictionary of Scientology terminology](   [Here's an excerpt]( from the book  Bare-faced Messiah: True Story of L.Ron Hubbard . Read it. It will blow your fucking mind. But there's so much more! Later, we'll learn about some of the people from that link.   I happened across that excerpt when I checked out  Operation Clambake . You should definitely spend time scrolling all the way to the bottom. The links there will keep you reading forever. There's stuff about that bullshit Narcanon and also Scientology's strategic use of celebrities to rake in cash.   There's also the [cost of Scientology]( Old data, but gives you some idea. Or how about the [techniques]( Those pages link forever.   Plus some of the personal stories of [people who have gotten out (note: if you're in Scientology, this is the link you want)]( are fucking horrifying. They're literally in exile [or much worse]( Anyway, you can read all about the owner's reasons for running the site [in the FAQ](   Oh, and really check out some of the forum posts. Keep in mind when you're reading that not so long ago Scientology was terrifying and powerful, and not the joke it's becoming today. They use lawyers like guided life destroying missiles. They strong armed the US Govt into granting them tax exempt status. Some people got out of Scientology specifically because of the info on that website.   The internet has really messed up their secrecy operation though, and I can't even imagine what that [sociopath Miscaviage]( is going through right now with this missing persons thing. Miscaviage is also the leader of the [Sea Org]( as well. That's the mysterious organization that makes you sign a contract for billion years of service. And yes, they even have actual ships. One's called the Free Winds. [Look at this ridiculous shit]( You can also think of it as Hubbards floating tax shelter/slave barge.   Or, you [here you can see]( Hubbard's original hand written notes on the OT III stuff. That's the level of Scientology where you learn about [Xenu]( Plus all the others. They were smuggled out of Scientology long ago and eventually made it to the internet. This is the [table of contents]( for that page.   I think that if you're in Scientology, and you've reached that level, and you read that bullshit - I think you pretty much have to accept it. Mainly because you just paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours of your time just to be able to read it.   If you want to get into even crazier shit, [read about Lisa McPherson]( who Scientology killed.   Or the [investigation]( into human trafficking and forced labor. Assholes.   And here's an entire other rabbit hole based on this guy named [Bob Minton]( Bob Minton basically championed Lisa Mcpherson's case all the way to court. He spent millions to fight Scientology and embarrass the fuck out of them. Even set up the Lisa McPherson foundation.   Anyway, in the end at court, Minton suddenly turned on the McPherson's and testified against them instead. Scientology went after McPherson's lawyer for misconduct, with Bob as their fucking witness. What the shit Bob? Clearly Scientology had finally gotten to him. His millions of dollars weren't enough. The wiki is amazing in the context of all of this. It tells how they eventually ruined him. Miscaviage doesn't fuck around, just ask his wife.   Oh oh oh, and if you've made it this far, here's your prize or.. whatever. It's a very long read, but it's just fascinating. I ran across it a long time ago when i was reading about this stuff and have remembered it ever since.   So this bit of fucking insanity was written by Bob Minton from above. It's an old usenet post from 1998 where he tells an incredible story about the true origin of Scientology, and a guy named Ralph Dorian. This will only have it's full effect after you've read a bunch about L. Ron though, so be sure and do that.   [Page 1]( is Minton describing the story he's about to unfold. [Page 2]( is the account written by this guy named Ralph Dorian who tells a story of what scientology was supposed to be, and that it had more than one writer. Keep in mind that this was written way  before  the Lisa Mcpherson trial which is what makes it so interesting.   Sorry factual errors or broken links. And complete goddamn randomness. It's late. Holy crap.   Oh! By the way, one of my favorite L. Ron. Hubbard stories - he once [stole Jack Parson's girlfriend] ( after doing [Magick]( with them!"
entertainment,"Deseret" is a word used in the Book of Mormon to mean "honeybee." The beehive is sort of a Utah Mormon symbol and a lot of church-y stuff uses it. The Deseret News is owned by the Church and I believe the Mormon Times is a weekly supplement.   The "women's wiring" stuff in the article and the ensuing analysis is really odd, though bear in mind that some stripes of LDS culture in Utah see Twilight as essentially relationship pornography - I think it's a well-believed fallacy in our modern society that women don't have sex drives, and it's easy for a culture that tiptoes around the specifics of sex and intimacy (believing them appropriate to address directly only between a couple) to say "well then, women must be turned on by something  instead  of pornography - let's say romance novels." Simplistic analysis and kneejerk thinking nobody really evaluates too closely tends to make its way into media channels."
entertainment,"When Mol and Cobb are in Limbo the first time, Cobb placed the top in her safe; that was  the  inception he performed on her.  The top represents the idea that the behavior of an object you alone know well can tell you whether or not you are someone else's dream or your own (it was never, contrary to popular belief, meant to distinguish the dream state vs reality).   This is a falsehood created by Cobb to get his wife to leave Limbo with him.   When Mol discovers the top she is finally able to understand that she is in Limbo, not reality.  I assume this is because Limbo is "unconstructed dream space" and does the top would not behave as she knew it to in reality. The first interpretation mentioned in the article, which seems to be the most obvious, is false.  Totems were an idea created by Cobb to save Mol from Limbo.  They may be useful in determining whether you are in your own dream or someone else's, but they have no ability to differentiate between a dream and reality."

MakeupAddiction,"Usually with contouring your face, you add shadows and highlights to highlight certain shapes on your face. If you have a round face, by adding in some bronzer under your cheekbones and highlighting above the blush, you can create a "thinning" effect.

[This one]( is my favourite, I think she really nails it. Hope that helps!   What I meant by saracir1's nose is that I think she created very straight, shadowy lines that make her nose appear straighter and thinner. Maybe it was from highlighting on the side too, I'm not sure, but the straightness seems a bit unnatural. Maybe she just has a perfect nose :P"

MakeupAddiction,"I rarely got up early enough to do makeup that took a lot of time... if you feel awkward about leaving the house without a full face you might want to perfect a minimalist version of it for days when you're running late to class, and maybe stock a makeup bag with your essentials to keep in your backpack so you can run out the door and put your makeup on in the bathroom before class if you have to.   I wouldn't worry too much about taking makeup cues from the people around you in college. There will be people that show up to class looking gorgeous and stylish every day and there will be people that wear pajamas to their morning classes. I got into a really unhealthy habit in college (especially after gaining my freshman 15) of comparing myself to the girls around me and always deciding that I fell short somehow.

argentina,"Hice la materia psiquiatr铆a en el Moyano. Una de las veces que fui un ayudante nos dio un tour por el hospital. Aparentemente, trabaj贸 ah铆  Christofredo Jakob .   La cuesti贸n es que hab铆a un pizarr贸n en una sala, la sala vallada, el pizarr贸n a medio borrar. 驴Por qu茅? Una asistente de una conocida productora televisiva estaba preparando la sala para filmar en ese ala. El pizarr贸n ten铆a dibujos que como seguramente no ten铆an nada que ver con el programa, deb铆an desaparecer. Pero ella no sab铆a y nadie le avis贸 que eran gr谩ficos de los cortes de Jakob, dibujados por Jakob mismo. Por eso desde entonces la sala estaba vallada."
argentina,"Upvotes for you. Justamente eso me estaba dando cuenta en estas 煤ltimas semanas. Antes ten铆a RE fichado quienes eran K o al menos comulgaban ligeramente con sus ideas. Hoy en d铆a entro, leo posts y digo "Da fuck, dude... eso no lo habr铆as dicho hace dos meses atr谩s".   No digo que est茅 bien o mal, pero simplemente me preocupa tener una visi贸n MUY parcializada de la realidad y no poder ver realmente para d贸nde est谩 yendo la nave. Antes con este subreddit no digo que lo pod铆a llegar a alcanzar, pero era lo m谩s cercano, sin tener que leer 6 diarios distintos, de los cuales 2 no me los puedo tragar, otros dos son otro chiste y el resto son... meh."
argentina,"estoy a mas de 500km, asi que no voto. fuck all.   igual, no se a quien votaria. ninguna de las opciones me convences. de lo que mas se acerca quizas es lousteau, pero tengo sentimientos muy encontrados con el tipo ese. desde que dejo de ser parte del gobierno lo leo y dice cosas muy coherentes. pero por que no las decia antes? no termino de descifrar si es un simple veleta, un inteligente y macabro o uno que penso que se podia ser kirchnerista+buena persona+inteligente y choco contra el paredon."
argentina,"Contexto: Mis viejos cuando se jubilaron hace ya muchos a帽os decidieron mudarse a Paraguay en una zona hermosa, selv谩tica y llena de cerros. Fue una buena decisi贸n.   El a帽o pasado a mi mam谩 la internaron porque estaba anemica y con una infecci贸n pulmonar (aparte de tener cancer) as铆 que me quedaba a cuidarla con mi hermana en el hospital. Una vez me quede durmiendo tipo croto arriba de un cart贸n pero con frazadita en un pasillo del hospital. Al d铆a siguiente mi hermana me dijo que me vaya a dormir a la casa de mis viejos por el tema de que asi veia si estaba todo bien, limpiaba un poco y de paso descansaba bien. Me tome el  colectivo   Pasan 30 minutos nada. 1 hora y nada. Cada tanto pasaba alg煤n cami贸n brazuca a toda velocidad. Mientras tanto no se veia nada en la ruta (sin iluminaci贸n) a los costados de la ruta cerros selv谩tico.   2 horas y nada. Yo agotadisimo de estar d铆as en el hospital cuidando a mi mam谩.   Empieza a llover.   La temperatura baja aun mas. (En paraguay el "invierno" dura un par de horas. El resto del a帽o hace 50掳 a la sombra)   Pasa el tiempo y me empiezo a congelar. Mi m茅todo de poner las manos a 1 cm de la lamparita ya no alcanza.   Empiezo a hacer dedo a los camiones brasile帽os que cada tanto pasan so riesgo de terminar como novia de camionero. Me pongo a cantar esto  mientras me doy cuenta que los camiones no van a parar nunca ya que justo estoy en una parte baja y los camiones esos necesitan mucho envion para subir el cerro. No iban a parar ni a ganchos por un argentino medio congelado.   Decido caminar hasta encontrar algun poblado. Me pongo a caminar y luego de un km me cruzo con un paraguayo. Me habla en guaran铆 y no entiendo un soto. Me habla en castellano y me doy cuenta que el tipo estaba re mamado. Le explico mi situaci贸n y le pregunto por el poblado mas cercano ya que el colectivo no pasa mas.   _Nahhh. Venite conmigo que vamos hasta lo de mi amigo asi le digo que te lleve.   _Eh... (me van a violar)   _Venite te digo as铆 nos tomamos unas ca帽as, curep铆.   _OK. (Recuerdo a Crispin el de PNP 驴Vivira por aca?)   _Nos pusimos a caminar y el choborra me empieza a contar como odia a los argentinos ya que una vez uno le hab铆a robado un celular. El tipo se empieza a enojar conmigo por ser argentino. Al rato me adora, despu茅s me odia de nuevo...   En un momento me dice mientras me apunta con su mano envuelta en una bolsa:   _Sabes lo que tengo ac谩?   _Eh... un arma?   _Si.   _En serio?   _ No curepa tarado. El arma la tengo guardada.   Seguimos caminando en medio de la nada y pienso en la idea de revolearlo al ca煤 por el puente que estamos cruzando. Meh... Mejor no lo hago ya que lo 煤nico que me falta es terminar en una c谩rcel paragua siendo porte帽o.   El borracho me invita a tomar de nuevo ca帽a en su casa que esta a una distancia desconocida por el mismo... mientras le explico que no tomo veo unas luces de la polic铆a a la distancia, se acerca mi salvaci贸n! En cuanto esta a unos 200 metros empiezo a hacerle se帽as a lo loco. La camioneta de la polic铆a dobla y se mete en el monte.   _Que haces argentino tarado? Sos boludo? Me van a fajar si me agarran.   Me despido del borrachin que milagrosamente decide irse vaya uno a saber donde.   De pronto de un camino de tierra al costado de la ruta aparece un gordo en una moto Yamazuki (si, esa marca existe. No es ni yamaha ni suzuki, es una marca paraguaya)   Lo paro y le explico mi situaci贸n. Le pido si me lleva a cambio de plata y me dice que si.   SALVADO!   Me subo a la moto del gordo y me doy cuenta que yo soy mas grandote que el. Casi en willy vamos como a 100 en bajada por los cerros paraguayos de noche, a 1 cm de la banquina mientras me congelo aun mas por el viento y la lluvia. Como deporte extremo eso de andar esquivando camiones no es lo mio.   Luego de 10 kms llegamos a destino. Yo al borde de la hipotermia, sin poder pensar claramente, me doy cuenta que no tengo plata paraguaya solo billetes argentos. Le explico que el peso argentino tiene un valor re groso, que cotiza fuerte y iba a poder cambiar esa plata en el banco sin problemas. Le doy como para comprarse 4 cervezas. Me dio ternura como inocentemente me crey贸 cada una de mis palabras mientras yo me sent铆a un poco como Kicillof.   Cual si fuera la tierra prometida logro llegar a la casa de mi vieja para por fin tirarme en un colchon y dormir sin que me importen los insectos gigantes que me empiezan a golpear la cara.   Creo que mas o menos termine por aca:"
Cockatrice,"As many of you many know, I'm infatuated with Junk Aristocrats. As such, with the inclusion of M14, I've been trying to figure out the best way in which to improve the deck. Most notably, I've been trying to incorporate Xathrid Necromancer and Archangel of Thune into the deck. I tested Shadowborne Demon, but while he acts as tutorable removal which is sweet, I often just wanted Obzedat or Archangel more. While Ghost Daddy seems like it is easily replaced by Archangel of Thune, the Necromancer requires a little more thought. For reference, here is Brad Nelson's [GP Miami list](   The options: 1) Blood Artist for Necromancer. This has been proposed by a writer for ChannelFireball and it merits some discussion. Often, BA feels like an 0/1 for 2 that does nothing when it comes into play as it requires other cards to optimize its utility. As a result, Necromancer would be a step up in getting value, albeit through a different means, by providing even greater wrath resistance. However, I am awfully greedy and can't help but see why these two can't live in harmony with each other, since their synergy together is quite impressive (A sac outlet with a Necromancer, Blood Artist, and a Traveler yields a Spirit and a Zambie as well as a point of damage/lifegain, and potentially five more if the Necromancer, its undead counterpart, the Spirit and Zombie generated from Traveler, and BA are sacced.) So onto option two:   2) Skirsdag High Priest for Necromancer. This makes me equally uneasy because while I preserve the synergy between BA and XN, I won't be able to outright steal games with the T3 Demon that is so vexing to deal with.   3) Removing a land and two Young Wolfs. I am vehemently opposed to this option because although Young Wolf is not a human, the recurrence of the Wolf is what makes this deck so good, both in terms of getting a T3 Demon as well as abusing him with a sac outlet to give cartel protection or Varolz regeneration. Dropping a land to go down to 24, however, is perfectly fine. This leads me to option four: Shaving.   4) Shaving other cards allows for the incorporation of Necromancer at the expense of reducing the consistency of the deck. Cards that could potentially be shaved: A land, which is perfectly fine. A Garruk, which is unfortunate as he is often removal. Also, his tutoring ability is devastating with this deck being so reliant upon synergy. He gets flipped quite often since the deck is great at chump blocking, and once you -1 him, you can go and find either the last piece of the puzzle you are missing, or just search up an Archangel of Thune and unleash mayhem. A Blood Artist. While I hate playing less than a playset of BA, it may be necessary since there are already only 3 SHP. Finally, I could just play two Necromancers, which might be okay but from testing, having multiple Necromancers out (unlikely with only two in the deck) at the same time is simply laughable, but I guess it functions similarly with a single Necromancer and two BA's. Lastly, I could exclude playing a 5 drop and go down to 23 lands in exchange for playing more BA's, SHP, and Necromancers, but the deck doesn't feel as strong without that big-game top end.   5) Don't play Necromancer. Just because he was printed doesn't mean you need to play it in your deck. You have enough interactions in the deck, and the extra synergy you gain from him takes away too much of this deck's core. Change isn't always good. But still swap Obzedat for Archangel, that guy's the tits.   As you can tell, there are a multitude of avenues this deck can go, and while I'm inclined to go with a variant which stems from option 4 (shaving a land, a garruk, and a BA for three Necromancers, or just play two and leave in the 4th BA), option 5 might just be the best version of the deck. Anyways, with that said, thoughts?"
borussiadortmund,"This whole thread is a "FUCK MIKI" and a "Miki is great its just circumstances!!" so I feel a need to give my 2 cents, even if it adds nothing to the discussion.  I would never condone hating a player on our team, so pls stahp   I've stated that I believe he is leaving this summer, because I get a vibe that he wants to.   Anyway, I can see why people dislike him:     Record Transfer fee, didn't even come close to his predecessor     Horrendous form, 0 goal 0 assists all season despite 1506 minutes on the pitch. I believe that everyone else but Schmelle and maybe Pische has scored at least once, and I know that Schmelle and Pische have some assists.     I honestly think that ever since the Real game, he has been scrutinized more because he put the spotlight on himself. That's all I can think about     Kagawa. We had to 'fix' Shinji, and he performed better in his return than Miki has all season. Miki was forced to live up to the heights of Shinji and that other guy.     We skipped out on Eriksen for this guy. Half the price, statistically worlds better, albeit I haven't seen Eriksen play so I can't judge.     Kevin De Bruyne. You're lying if you wont admit he is better. Mou was a cunt, so now we have a (unfair to miki) comparison playing and destroying the same competition.       Counterpoints:     Its completely unfair to judge him against 2012 Shinji, and tunnelcunt.     Everyone was shit in the beggining of the season--not as poor as miki though--also, could other poor perfomances have been inspired by lackluster playmaking while reus was kill? idk       3.He has never been anything but happy to play for us, he deserves the same respect.   He doesn't deserve the shit he gets, but he also has played like shit. I dislike his play, but feel nothing but compassion for him. I hope that he gets his Shaktar form, even though that's unlikely. I pity him because a lot of it isn't his fault, but if he played almost as good as Eriksen, De Bruyne, Et.c then he wouldn't be in this situation   Now I think we should part with him, as this is poor for his career and he ins't the player we needed. That's just my personal opinion on this."
dragonage,"More love interest/companion interactions.   THIS is what I want the most.  DA:O did it pretty well, but because of the way it was animated and such, with no movements really or even that much facial expression (and no voiced Warden), the conversations felt static and got a little boring at times after 5+ playthroughs.  In DAII it seemed like every interaction with your LI (and really most regular companions, minus the sex part) was "hey here's my backstory", "oh hey, here's some horrible shit that's happened to me/my family/my cat/my people/my left shoe", "hey I need your help!", "oh hey, I love you let's have sex", and then "oh hey, final battle, we're all gonna die let's kiss."   That's oversimplifying, of course, and I really did love my lovers in DA2, but... I just want more wholesome interaction!  I don't care about the sex so much, that's not the core of a relationship in my mind (though it's certainly hot to see Fenris slam M!Hawke into the wall and passionately make out... I would never complain of more of that, hehe).   What I want is more interaction like in Mass Effect, particularly ME3, most especially in the Citadel DLC.  I want the silly jokes and the "laugh it up, Garrus," and the "what is she doing with her arms?" teasing, and the special date night dancing at the club, or a peaceful lunch at a cafe, or overlooking a beautiful view and hearing stories about a character's mother, or bragging about the Reaper you just killed over a game of poker.   I want that conversation, I want to see that depth of character that goes beyond "I'm a mage and I'm possessed and I want to free my people from the oppression of the Chantry and I'll hurt you even though I love you."  Hell, just tell me their favorite color!  ANYTHING.   I want more stories about Anders' life in the Circle, his friends and enemies, drama and midnight trysts, see him interacting with some kitties!  I want to hear more about Fenris' time with the Fog Warriors, what they were like, and what are some things he's always wanted to do that he and Hawke could do together.  I want wild stories from Isabela, about her voyages and adventures, to be shown the basics of how to sail a ship, to expose a little more of that sensitive, tender side she pretends she doesn't have.  I want Hawke and Carver (or Bethany) to reminisce more about their childhood, and swap stories.  I want more stories from Sebastian's wild younger years ;)  I want to know  anything  about Varric!  About his childhood, his life, BIANCA, anything!  I feel so close to him and yet, know next to nothing about him.   Aveline was one that I felt was perfectly executed.  She had lots of interaction that wasn't based on something she needed from Hawke, she gave up enough information about her past that you got to know her without it being too dull, she offers condolences on Hawke's mom's death (why didn't they all do this??  Why wasn't there a funeral, like the one for a certain character in ME Citadel?  I would have loved that - and cried).  I don't know, something about her I've always just found as well done.  I see her as a well-polished character who you get lots of good interaction with.   /rambling"
dragonage,"I sort of like her, but wouldn't excuse her words or actions. She's an interesting character to have around, even though I completely disagree with her views. If you have her in your party for long enough (or, like me, listen to the banter on YouTube), you see that she eventually gets more civil with the others. Not friendly, but better. In a way, she's a bit like Sera - not at all open for any kind of criticism and always convinced her truth is the entire truth. It's funny. She probably wouldn't like the comparison."
dragonage,"Oh man, Flemeth's quote gets me every time.   Makes me think about all of the history and current events we learn, for obvious reasons, but I especially think about the little snapshots I get of the people around me as I travel.   I made up the advice of "judge others like you judge yourself: by intent" ages ago and relate that to this. Most people we interact with do not show their full selves to us, so we compartmentalize them in order to process info faster and get on with our regular routines."
girlsinyogapants,"No, she fucking doesn't fucking have the most fucking glorious fucking ass in the fucking world, and this fucking post is fucking the most stupidest fucking thing in the fucking world."
PS4,"I think it will definitely hold its value鈥擲ony would be pretty stupid to make it any other way.   This is the way I imagine it will work, although I could obviously be totally wrong:     online play will be free鈥攂ecause that is one of the biggest reasons to migrate from the Xbox.   cross game chat will be free鈥攁gain, another reason to switch consoles.   the use of the share button (excluding live streaming) will be free鈥攂ecause it would be foolish of them to put a button on the controller that is rendered completely unusable without a subscription, although it makes sense to make livestreaming premium.   the easy download methods/smart buying will be free鈥攊t promotes the spending of money and Sony likes money.     Everything else will be behind a pay wall.   Then, with the apparent ease of putting content on the store, there should be a higher number of games than we anticipate to hand out for free to PS+ customers. The potential for indie developers to use it for advertising is fantastic, meaning that they can then rely on their next game selling assuming the first is well received. Then once we get further into the life cycle, at least 6 months but probably closer to 12 or 18 months, we might see retail games given out for free.   Finally, if they do manage to get their rumoured Netflix of games up and running, the value will go through the roof (although that might require a higher priced subscription, which I'm sure most would be willing to accept)."
PS4,"If you play online  you will get more games and they will be newer than the ones on live it seems. so far they mentioned halo 3(2007) and Assassins Creed 2(2009) while PS+ right now offers Uncharted 3 (2011), Saints Row 3(2011) both in Nov of 11 and X-com ( late 2012) you also get a version of drive club when ps4 comes out and a hand full of vita games. PS+ is also cheaper. The PS4 also has an upgradeable hard drive that you will need to hold all the games "free" games you will get."
PS4,"He said that it is not impossible but it's extremely difficult. It's not like an Excel Spreadsheet where we can go in and change the name in and out but it is a core part of their infrastructure. We wanted to prioritize games and other features first, but this is not to say this won't change in the future. We want to make PS4 the best platform we can so we will work to do so. This is me paraphrasing but this is basically what he said."
PS4,"Of course, not everyone knows every single game journalist in the industry. I like the GB guys a lot too, eventhough they're pretty good at avoiding vidogame talk in their massive podcasts...   But you should try  beyond  (ign playstation podcast) not what it used to, but man does this podcast has history...   feeds.ign.com/ignfeeds/podcasts/beyond/   the  wink  when Shue says beyond in the video is because he actually said he listen to every single podcasts, and a lot of his ideas come from there. He also showed the folks from the podcast on the big screen during the E3, posing with shue..."
PS4,"I bought the A40s when the newer 2013 Mixamp was released. I did not like the closed style of the A40s earcups so I gave them to my brother and looked around some forums. I picked up a pair of Audio Technica ATH-AD700(s) and a Zalman mic for use with the Mixamp. Best soundstage I've had the pleasure of listening to.   If you don't like hearing anything other than your game, you'll like the A40s or the A50s, but you don't get the depth of direction you do with other headphones. If you want to close your eyes and be able to visualize where the sound is coming from and be able to judge how far away a sound is located, then get just the mixamp and buy your own headphones and mic.   To try and put into words the difference between the A40s and the ATH-AD700(s) when playing a FPS that I have noticed, I would describe it as such: The A40s block out most sounds other than your game audio. When you hear a gun shot or any noise you can definitely tell what direction it is coming from, but when closing your eyes and trying to visualize it, it is like you can only see about a 5 or 10 foot radius around you. Compared to the AD-700s when put in the exact same situation, it is like you have an increased sonar. Sounds can be heard and give not only a directional indication, but more depth of say a 30 foot radius.   It is something you really have to hear for yourself to believe and I was surprisingly shocked when I tried the two pairs back to back."
PS4,"I had the A50s but they had way too many charging problems.  I did research on their support forum and apparently other had the same problem.  81 pages of people had the same problem since 2011 and ASTRO has done nothing to fix it.  I considered the A40s but the A30s were much more comfortable and nearly the same sound quality."
PS4,"Simple answer. No   Complicated answer. No, unfortunately not and it's not know weather sony are planning to either."
PS4,"I bought both but I know your dilemma. It's why I bought both haha.  Haven't touched GTA yet as I just picked up the games last night but dove into DA for about 3 hours.  Playing on Nightmare and being my first forray into the series, I had quite a hard time with the first demon boss, but I could not go to bed until I defeated him.  Being able to play with the action-rpg elements of player controlled, switching between characters quickly, then at the click of the track pad being able to pause and tactically maneuver your party is incredibly fun.   Game is gorgeous. Frame rate stutters during cinematics that I have watched so far but honestly doesn't bother me.  Story is already sucking me in while I only have a vague understanding of the Dragon Age universe and the rifts between races/factions/political side of things.   With GTA...you know what it is.  You've played it before as have I (but I didn't get very far cause it caused my PS3 to obtain the YLOD), but I see this as the "definitive" version of the game.  Like Diablo 3: UEE, it's the version of the game that is going to be there to pick up and play whenever you want a taste of that genre.  First person is definitely something I am looking forward to checking out."
PS4,"120hz refresh rate on a panel for gaming is bad. It effectively doubles the frame rate for the content you're viewing through interpolation. It guesses every next frame to make it appear that you have 60fps instead of 30.   For games this just adds latency to input. For example, playing Call of Duty online with 120hz mode on will result in you getting shot more because when you tap the buttons to bring up your sights, there will be an ever so slight delay between the press and the display reacting, because the displays processing unit is taking longer to show the images due to it having to double back and interpolate the frames.  Input lag is a serious deal in games, and that is where companies like Panasonic and Toshiba and occasionally Sharp/LG lead the pack typically. Sony and Samsung are both good for it as well, as they develop their own processors for their displays, which are fast enough to cut down the latency.   Vizio is a terrible brand to buy for this reason. They don't create their own chipsets, which leads to lower entry cost for the display but ends up costing in display lag. Some higher end models are okay, but will never compare to a bigger brand due to the chips being faster and smarter for power."
PS4,"Your kind of a prick for that. You expect us to know every single model and every single spec? No one knows that."
PoliticalHumor,"I'm not just talking Presidential. People don't pay attention to the House or Senate (hence, 40 year terms), Governorships, or even their own counties and towns.   Yes, the media puts it's thumb on the scale for Presidential elections. However, with an educated and participatory voting populace, even that weight would be mitigated as coverage would have to go to the candidate the populace wants to hear about (rise and fall of Cain, for example).   It is unfortunate, and I don't discount that there are powerful forces that influence elections, but I believe the only reason that those forces have such influence is because people don't pay attention."
PoliticalHumor,"It can be done.   Flunked 4th grade and discarded by my teachers. Gave up on them in turn and set about educating myself. Read every book in grade school, junior high, and high school libraries. Read every non-fiction book in city and county libraries. Discovered regional library system and started on that.   Teachers and fellow students decided I was weird and left me alone. When I finished HS I had the highest SAT scores in our school district's history. Admitted and graduated from state's top private college.   Started adult life with a high-status near-useless degree, no money, and no support system. No 'old boy' contacts or network.   Starting broke and homeless, I worked sub-minimum wage day labor for years while building up a cash pad (dug ditches, drove combines, loaded freight cars). Used that money to pay my way through trade school. And so on and so on..."
bleachshirts,"What I do is just hold it underwater when I get the color I want.  Then after I am done soaking it I pull the stencil off.  Pulling the stencil off takes 30 seconds at least for small stencils.  With the bleach still on the shirt it might bleed into your design if you pull it off then."
freemasonry,"Swedish Mason here. Can confirm. The Norwegian GL (DNFO) practices the Swedish Rite which requires a Christian confession.   That being said, nobody will judge your level of religiosity. As long as you are willing to self-identify as a Christian, the definition of what you actually mean with that is up to you and your own conscience. The question will be put to you, during the initiation. I've heard candidates getting away with as vague statements as "I sympathize with the Christian values" and thus dodging the question completely. I can not guarantee that will always work of course.   Personally I see the requirement for christian confession as our greatest threat for recruitment and relevance in the future. Unfortunately (again, my opinion) the GL policymakers belong to a very different generation and consider it a strength.   So without knowing anything about you I'd definitely recommend you to join. That is if you think you can live with the christian slant. I think we have a great thing going here, and sooner or later the matter of religiosity needs to be addressed."
golf,"I think he still has the drive to get to 19. I think to him, that's priority #2.   Does he want it as bad as when he won his first Masters and when he had the Tiger Slam? Want? Yes. Prioritize as #1. No.   He's said numerous times his kids are now #1.   However, when I see any great... and I mean truly great (not just a pro... but the cream of the crop)... they are not great because they are more talented than everyone else. These guys on tour are amazing. They can putt lights out, get up and down from everywhere, etc. It's not their skill that separates the great pros from the truly great ones. The cream of the crop.   It's a mindset. They have a better mental game than all their competitors. That's what gives them the extra tiny bit to get them into the top 0.1% of athletes. Take anyone from the top 0.1% of athletes. Michael Jordan. Kobe Bryant. Wayne Gretsky. Jack. Tiger. Whoever.   None of these guys are there because they were more talented than everyone else. The thing that makes a 0.1% upper echelon athlete succeed is a mental attitude not shared by the other 99.9%.   Take the sport most rife with drugs as an example. Tour de france, bodybuilding, whatever. Those sports are drug fueled. Take two clones. Same mental attitudes, same physical attributes. Put one on drugs, and the other not on drugs. Who wins? In those sports you simply can't compete without the use of drugs anymore because someone will just come along with your same physicaly attirbutes and mental attitude but they will take drugs, and crush you.   The same goes for the upper 0.1% of athletes. You simply can't be in the top 0.1% on talent alone because someone else will come along... have your exact skill... but will have a mental fortitude 10 times greater... and crush you.   Tiger has not stumbled upon 14 Majors because of a crazy talent he has. There have been greater ball strikers, short game artists, and putters. Does anyone out there dare say he struck the ball better than Hogan, had the short game of Seve, of putts better than Crenshaw. Well, he might be the best putter the game has ever seen.   However, what has got him their is the attitude instilled in him by his father and mother from age 2 to age 20 and beyond.   I would go as far to say that by looking at who a child is between 2-18... you can determine with 90% accuracy what they will be like when they are 30. Often the things parents instill in you as children never change. They become a part of you.   Tiger got to 14 by having an upper echelon 0.1% mental game. A burning desire greater than perhaps anyone. THAT is what his got him to 14.   Now, you're asking "is he content with his accomplishments". A person like this... simply cannot be content. If he were the content type of person, he'd probably have less than a handful of majors based on his skill. People don't simply go from having possibly the greatest burning desire of any athlete in this generation to being content. He wakes up everyday... much like his dad taught him... "how can I be better today than I was yesterday".   It's like a catch 22. You want to be content with becoming the greatest golfer of all time... but to get to be the greatest golfer of all time... you cannot have a content attitude. You'll never become the greatest (as previously mentioned... someone will come along with all your skill and physical attributes... but they will come along with the burning desire attitude you don't possess... and crush you). Instead... you must have a burning desire like no one else, never being content, but always striving each day to be better than the previous... and then... when your desire pays off and everything comes to fruition... and maybe Tiger wins 19 Majors... you still aren't content. Because you aren't a content kind of guy. You still wake up, retired, having won 19, and still want to better than you were yesterday.   That's what separates upper echelon athletes from the rest."
golf,"This was a dilemma for me as well. I started playing baseball/hockey/anything with a stick or bat left handed as a kid. My Dad's reasoning was that I was right eye dominant, so I would see a pitch coming from a pitcher better batting left handed. A few years ago, I attempted to pick up golf and decided to try right handed. I had a terrible slice, and I dropped it pretty quickly. A few years later I bought a left handed set of clubs, and really couldn't make great contact. Then about 3 months ago I got a new set of righty clubs, and I worked on my slice like any other golfer. I've found out that I get more power swinging righty then I do lefty (funny enough this goes for softball/baseball as well). I still play softball, and bat left-handed but I don't think it messes with my swing (as I play golf right-handed). That's just my story, and I think it'll be whatever feels the most comfortable for you."
golf,"Be prepared to pay. That said, you probably won't have to. Maybe for the greens fees, but almost every club has a food minimum that is way too high, so you're almost doing him a favor. If you're prepared to pay, then it's not even an issue. And don't sneakily try to offer or some bs, they'll ask if they want you to pay.   Shoes - change them inside in the locker room, or when you get to the cart if there are no locker rooms. Not the parking lot. Wear loafers, those will be fine walking from the car to the clubhouse, and great for lunch.   Lockers - Don't put yourself in a position to need one. Jacket? in the bag. Phone, wallet, keys? in the bag. Don't bring too much extra.   Phone - etiquette is to not use it on the course. Don't make calls in the practice area either. Need to send a quick text? As long as it's on silent, no one cares. It's the same as normal society though, if you're on your phone the whole time, you're a dick. Don't be on your phone and you won't have to worry.   Hats off inside - golf course, private club, or mcdonalds, it's always a proper thing to do. There is never going to be a rule that hats have to stay on inside. Take it off, no longer have anything to worry about.   Changing clothes - 1. it's probably a casual lunch, so no. 2. How much do you sweat? Would you change if it was a nice public course? If so, pack another polo in your bag  2. wear pants, almost always times clubhouse rules require pants. Slacks/chinos. Not cargo pants. Not jeans. Not shorts.   Maybe I'm getting the wrong vibe, but you sound like you're building this up to be much more than it is. The members are people too. They aren't looking for every little fault in a random guest. They're just there to do a little golfing. Enjoy the round, shoot the shit, realize it's normal life."
Torchlight,"Fuck Gawker and anything related to Gawker.   Years ago (before I was on reddit, and I've been reading reddit for 5+ years) I registered an account with Kotaku with my main e-mail address which I was using many years prior - which was spam free.   Not long after registering with them I started getting spam, later on I hear they got hacked, did anyone get an apology, nope.   Yeah I'm sore about something kinda minor, but whatever, fuck that company for all it's worth."
Torchlight,"I'm sorry, but I don't submit evidence to child rapists.  What I will do, in my infinite generosity, is allow you an attempt to clear your own name - that is, unless you're too busy raping children.   What you need to do is post all of your real life information - name, address, recent photograph, et cetera.  Additionally, I insist that you provide a detailed history of your Internet usage, so that we can pour over it and see how it definitely includes raping children.  We'll then go through your logs, and if you're really clean then we'll leave you alone.  Hopefully we'll go through them before someone uses your information to track you down and do something illegal, but that's the risk you took when you decided to literally rape children in the first place.   I realize you aren't going to do that, and I know why.  While the innocent may have nothing to hide, you're hardly innocent.  In fact, the mere fact that you haven't given us what I so reasonably demanded only goes to further prove that you're obviously guilty of raping children."
Torchlight,"First let me say I used to consider myself a feminist until I started seeing so many articles like this one.  Now I'm someone who acknowledges that privilege and sexism are real things, but I stay away from the "f-bomb."  (Also, for you casual readers, please read my entire comment before you downvote me as a SRS/MRA supporter, 'cause I'm neither.)   You're not supporting the article solely with your comment, so I don't think you should be getting quite so downvoted.  I read through your recent comment history and you don't seem to be a troll, so here's an honest response more detailed than "it sucks."  Because that article is awful awful awful bad bad bad.  And his followup was over-the-top insulting.  Normally, I would re-read something to give specific quotes and details, but it upsets me way too much to be worth it.   If the entire article was a single sentence that said, "Being a straight white male in the US often gives you a lot of privileges, sort of like starting with extra points in character creation in a RPG."  It would be totally fine.  That's true!  It's a true thing to say!  It's not speaking in absolutes and it doesn't minimize people's experiences.  The actual article, however, does.   The article wasn't written to change anyone's mind, but it was framed like it was.  Because the premise is one that would be useful to reach out to people who haven't thought much about gender politics or who are more moderate on those issues.  It devolved from a decent premise into a "you don't know how hard life  really  is" and started belaboring the point using insular language and making lots of referential nods to existing feminist culture.   A lot of people on his blog, on Gawker, and I believe here on Reddit gave him a lot of very level-headed, calm, and surprisingly thorough feedback on why he was off-base and why his article wasn't successful; in other words, they furthered the discussion.  His response was no more thought out than "I'm right, you're wrong; my original article was perfect in every way and if you disagree, you're 'mansplaining' and an idiot."   That's not the way to spread acceptance of your ideas; that's being a ideologue. It's essentially screaming at people, and then plugging your ears.  That's not what feminism should be about; that's just a religion."

NAU,"Pros: Cool fall and spring, moderate summers, SNOW!!! It snows in the winter, wide selection of dining options, expansive amount of resources for freshmen and undergrads, smaller class sizes, hundreds of official clubs, including club sports like Karate, Youn Wha Ryu, Roller Derby, Water Polo, USA Archery, Badjakcs (dance), Ultimate Frisbee, Quidditch, Scooting, as well as non-sport clubs and organizations, like the Anime club, Philosophy club, ASNAU (Student Gov't), PRISM (People Respecting Individuals and Sexual Minorities), and a group for just about every foreign language, political interest, and religion imaginable.  Cons: wind. Just the fucking wind. Summers are a little warmer than what people expect (80-85 during the day), Construction projects - there's always something happening somewhere, buses are packed when it starts getting cold b/c nobody wants to walk.   Things you should know: 1) If you drink or do other drugs, be discrete about it. If you don't cause trouble or blow your horn about drinking, you won't get into trouble. You should also know that NOBODY can enter your dorm room without your permission. An RA can open up and see if you're okay if he or she suspects you are in need of serious medical attention, service workers can enter when you are gone to affect repairs on internet, plumbing, electric, etc, and you must open up for Police IF AND ONLY IF they have a warrant for your arrest/search/seizure of property. THAT BEING SAID, do not abuse these benefits of living on campus. Be considerate to your neighbors and uniformed officials. Be respectful of those around you and be responsible for your actions. 2) You're going to get a lanyard. Don't. fucking. wear it. Put that shit away. Nobody wants to see your I.D. hanging from your neck, and everybody hates that you have your life attached to it, with the end hanging out of your pocket. Both of these are dumb-ass moves to pull. Don't be an obvious freshman. Put your I.D. in your wallet/purse and put your keys in your pocket. 3) Remember what being a freshman was like in high school? It'll be kind of like that, except you won't (hopefully) be as awkward. People will be a little more accepting of you and interested in you, but don't let that make you forget your manners or your intelligence. 4) Keep on top of due dates not only for homework, but things like exams, enrollment dates, add/drop/withdraw dates, and financial dues.   Social life: My best advice is: If you want to buy your friends, join a fraternity or sorority. I'm not saying you won't meet great people, but understand that you are buying your way into a social sect. If that's not for you, see option 2: If you want to make legitimate friends (not that there's something wrong with fratbros/sorohoes), attend the club info fair and join some clubs that interest you. If you're religious, join the religious club of your choice. You also don't have to be religious to make friends who are. I'm part of NAU Chabad, the Jewish organization on campus, and I'm not even Jewish. I don't even have Jewish ancestors or relatives, to my knowledge. Talk to your classmates every day if you can, and meet all your neighbors right away. Don't be the awkward guy or girl who never says hi in the hallway and doesn't know his or her neighbors names. You live with these people. Be their friends.   Good luck!!!"
Republican,"Not so sure. We have had a shit ton of moronic and insane legislation under Brewer and Pearce. While immigration is important, hispanics have a strong vote. I feel we will have a referendum on state politics. Between the constant attacks on immigrants and women's rights coupled with insane state politics... AZ will be a challenge for Mittster. Having said that, there is a strong Mormon voting block here - they're just not nearly as strong as the Hispanic+women vote.   Operation Fast and Furious is just more noise in the constant drone of violence on the border. I doubt it will have much effect at all among hispanics. That issue only works with white men."
DebateReligion,"Some personal info first: I live in Detroit, arguably the most downtrodden major city in the USA. Thirty percent of the city lives at or below the the poverty line. Remember, this line is defined as 20,000 US dollars per year for a family of four. This means that there are countless others who are poor and not living beneath this line. Suffice to say, I think I have a rather intimate understanding of issues of poverty, at least in my city.   Now, the questions.   >Is it OK to give a few dollars once a week and feel absolved from ones Christian duty?   Absolutely not. We are told to take up our crosses and follow Christ. This is a lifelong, all day, everyday commitment. If we do not follow the teaching's of Christ with our whole being, we are being false Christians. The idea that I can give to charity once a week and then go and spit on the homeless with the other six days is ridiculous and anti-Christian. We are called to follow Christ at all times, in all things.   >Is it enough to feel that these people have made poor choices and thus, "get what they deserve?"   No. In America, these issues are systemic. That's demonstrably true. There exist power institutions which prevent the poor from overcoming their poverty. While some misfortune may result from personal choice, I don't think it's fair to say that all the poor are at fault. When the prevailing system tells the upper classes that the American dream is alive, but tells the poorer classes that they're lazy scum, we're bound to have some problems.   >Shouldn't a truly Christian COMMUNITY be doing more?   Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely. But most people are CINO's - Christians in name only. It's typically true of the politically right-wing Christians, but  liberal Christians are guilty of this too.   >Is it just a matter of not caring about people and choosing to focus on other initiatives instead? The ol' "You can't help everyone" idea?   As namer said, you can't help everybody. But, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. Just because I'm focused on ending institutionalized poverty in the city of Detroit, doesn't mean I don't care about the institutionalized racism of non-white, non-black minorities in the city (In Detroit, 80 percent of the city is of African descent, making them the majority). I care about he plight of the Bengali people living in the inner city, but I'm currently working on poverty.   > How does one bridge the disconnect between the reality of what one would see, smell and hear every single day - people are literally starving in the streets - with a WWJD mandate from the pulpit?   Laziness and a lack of priories. People don't want to get their hands 'dirty'. They'd much rather write a check then come down from the suburbs and help the impoverished - that's a Detroit thing; the wealth disparity due to the white flight of the 1960's and 70's is insane. As well, people often prioritize the perceived 'social values' of Christianity over truly helping the impoverished. This can range from hating gays to wanting prayer in school. Whatever it is, it's not what Christ said to do.   Perhaps the biggest problem with modern American Christians - at least from what I've seen - is that they tend to combine the Protestant work ethic with some sort of karmic philosophy (never thought I'd write that sentence). That is, they seem to think that hard work = success and therefore everyone who is poor is lazy and doesn't want it. This view is what I call the greatest American heresy, and is one of the largest problems plaguing Christianity. People don't follow Christ's teachings in the context that he taught them - they absorb non-religious, non-factual, classist nonsense into them and call it Christianity.   Which it's not."

DebateReligion,"simply ignorance or perhaps a shade of pride as well. People build on previous ideas without ever questioning why we accepted the previous ideas as fact.   Now I have no university education in something relevant to biology but from my other university experience I would have a hard time believing that.   Do you have experience with education in biology in universities, maybe even in different countries?   >It has always, ALWAYS been the person willing to confront the consensus that has revolutionized any field.   Well, how long does that usually take? How old is creationism? 80-120 years? And how much funding did it get in this time? Alone the creation museum cost 27 Million Dollars according to wikipedia. Wouldn't it have produced something convincing yet?   Are there really revolutions to expect in fields like biology in that one of the leading theories turns out to be completely false? Maybe some centuries and possibly several decades back when there was actually very little known at all about how the world works, but today with all the large scale modern science that has gone into it? Now the understanding of biology is actually decent enough to genetically engineer plants or grow new hearts from stem cells (well, nearly) and there are so many other fields that borrowed the ideas that have been found out in evolutionary biology. For example evolutionary programming / genetic algorithms. And the best thing: It works as well as expected."
DebateReligion,"To know everything about God would be to gain the knowledge that God is said to possess. What separates humans from, in this case, the God of Abraham? Knowledge about how God allegedly produced the events/effects/interactions/causations attributed to God. So yes, I agree with the Priest, by remaining ignorant God seems, in comparison, to be more amazing, more "special." It is interesting that the Priest suggests that people strive to remain willfully ignorant - though such ignorance does allow one to more easily control ones adherents.   And that is a good summary presentation of the God of Gaps argument for the existence/non-existence of God."
DebateReligion,"Most people are familiar with theists saying things like "God is outside of time" or "outside of space" (I prefer "underneath" time and space). But I do not think that, from those, we should infer that God is also "outside of logic".   The "power" to commit logical impossibilities is not really a power. First, let's be clear, "logic" is a human endeavor to represent interconnections of true statements. There are plural logics, but from that, it does not follow that there are multiple conflicting truths (just different human systems not yet reconciled).   So logic is a very different sort of thing than time or space. The object of logic, reason, intelligibility, etc., is truth itself. They are what  Is . Supposing there was a god (and let's keep to the scope of the question), it would be more accurate to say that logic is coextensive with God.   So to ask whether God can operate outside of logic is tantamount to saying that God can be not God. That's not a power; that would be a handicap.   That being said, the Thompson's Lamp paradox depends on a strictly linear understanding of time. There is a whole lot left we have to learn about time, and when we do (and I expect we will, someday), there might be a logically sound answer to Thompson's paradox."
DebateReligion,"To quote Augustine ( Civ. Dei , 19.17):   >The earthly city, which does not live by faith, seeks an earthly peace, and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered concord of civic obedience and rule, is the combination of men's wills to attain the things which are helpful to this life. The heavenly city, or rather the part of it which sojourns on earth and lives by faith, makes use of this peace only because it must, until this mortal condition which necessitates it shall pass away. Consequently, so long as it lives like a captive and a stranger in the earthly city, though it has already received the promise of redemption, and the gift of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes no scruple to obey the laws of the earthly city, whereby the things necessary for the maintenance of this mortal life are administered; and thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony between them in regard to what belongs to it.   >[...]   > This heavenly city, then, while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens out of all nations, and gathers together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not scrupling about diversities in the manners, laws, and institutions whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained, but recognizing that, however various these are, they all tend to one and the same end of earthly peace. It therefore is so far from rescinding and abolishing these diversities, that it even preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to the worship of the one supreme and true God is thus introduced. Even the heavenly city, therefore, while in its state of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as it can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains a common agreement among men regarding the acquisition of the necessaries of life, and makes this earthly peace bear upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be truly called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment of God and of one another in God."
DebateReligion,"I'd like a bit of discussion on the word "arbitrary".  First, I appreciate that you used "arbitrary" rather than "random".  However, I'm not sure it's even all that arbitrary.   Certainly, there are minor nuances that may be arbitrary.  But I don't think the answer to the question "Is murder moral?" (for example) is arbitrary.  Any inherited tendency that arbitrarily answered that question in the affirmative would tend to not be as frequent in future generations, it seems to me.  In the same way that any inherited tendency to find nutritious food distasteful would tend to not be as common in future generations.   Of course, there is a lot of complexity we're not getting into here (in-group vs. out-group altruism, for example) but I'm just not sure that a social species has as much "freedom" to set itself on any course as your post suggests."

DebateReligion,"If you are not a bible literalist I would posit that you are not a real Christian, as for the most part it is impossible to discern the metaphor from the literal in the book. Thing is, if you're not a 'real' Christian, then you're not a Christian, but that's okay - I'll try to explain:   As a book of instructions for how to exist as laid out by God, one would hope that there was zero ambiguity in the message that would allow for misinterpretation. The penalty for guessing wrong is eternal damnation, you'd better hope that God can communicate clearly! However, the presence of contradictions should be worthy of questioning the legitimacy of the entire book. One argument that counters this is that the bible was mistranslated by man. Would an omnipotent God allow his word to be misunderstood, put to print and distributed?   We have two choices: Take the whole thing literally, which is commendable only in that the ability to adhere to such an arbitrary, restricting set of rules is astounding given how petty some of them are - yet also means you would condone a lot of the awful things that are commanded in the bible. These bible literalist are 'real' Christians, but they are untrustworthy.   The other choice would be to take the whole thing as a metaphor, which gives you a lot more 'wiggle room' to change your beliefs. This way, we could cherry pick the good stuff. However, a lot of the objectively good guidance doesn't require a God to be followed. We shouldn't need the threat of eternal damnation to know that killing innocent people is wrong for example. The other problem with taking the entirety of the bible as a metaphor is that some of it is indeed unambiguous. God didn't mince words when he acted as such:   (Romans 1:27)"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet. " I was originally going to quote Leviticus 20:13, but there was an ambiguous mention of "mankind" instead of "man" which I suppose is open to interpretation.   What I'm getting at is that you don't need the threat of eternal damnation to be a good person. So many of us godless people are perfectly capable of being the love we want to receive ourselves, and it stems from our historic nature as social animals, capable of empathy. If you're not a Bible literalist you're not a real Christian. And that's just fine, it's okay to not be one at all!   Make yourself your own God, do what's right because it's the right thing to do - not because you've been told to by a book that also won't let you eat shrimp. Shrimp is tasty!"
DebateReligion,"What would you gain from a rebellion?   A) Succeed, and you killed the creator of the world, and presumably the master of the afterlife. What then? If it was undeniable that God exists, then wouldn't that mean Heaven and Hell exists? With no God, would you go to heaven or hell? Would heaven be in utter chaos after the slaying of its creator? Would Lucifer, the one who wanted to destroy humanity, reign over both heaven and hell, and what would happen to us then? It would be pointless rebelling violently, and God isn't known for taking opinions or people questioning/disobeying him.   B) Fail, face the wrath of God, or beg for forgiveness and hope. You're nothing but a slave now with a pissed off master (who's extremely volatile).   Honestly, if there is a God and if he's like in the old testament, then I'd say it's better to be without one.

DebateReligion,"Then you need to be much more careful with your words.   # > They reject the Christian god outright, but then fall back to "I'm not making claims" just because they left a back door open that some sort of God might exist.   No. Just No. I will say the things that amount to me disagreeing with your claim. My going further by exploring my disagreements and judgements of the specifics of the claim or its tenants is still not a reason for you to independently decide that I have taken a position counter to yours; it means only that I don't agree with yours, and that is all. To consider me holding a counter position at that point is an assumption on your part and is entirely your problem.   > You can remain claim free by saying "I don't know if this guy was or wasn't abducted by aliens". However, if you have a negative tone as is implied by the sentence "I have no reason to believe that you were abducted by aliens", then you are making a negative counter-claim.   # > The statements you expressed earlier definitely have a negative bent to them as opposed to neutral.   This is your sensitivity. "There is no good reason to believe X" and "I have no reason to believe X" are both equivalent with the non-position "I do not believe X." They just sound judgemental because they are; and the use of that tone is my choice to make independent of the position I hold.   Note that even if I do hold a position counter to the one I'm disagreeing with, none of those statements claim so. My disagreement with the truth value of your claim is in no way an agreement or disagreement with ANYTHING ELSE AT ALL. You can read implications into my rejection of a position if you like, and they may be somewhat accurate, but they do not amount to my holding of a position regardless.   PS. I think your example about god hints at you being either obsessed at best or dishonest at worst. The vast, vast majority of atheists reject your CLAIMS of god, especially the Christian god, vehemently without claiming there's no god; and it's convenient to be dishonest about them because if you think they're denying all chances of a god and then trying to be slippery, then they're being unreasonable and it's then reasonable for you to disregard either their disagreements or just them entirely."
polandball,"Disclaimer, there are probably going to be some mistakes and / or oversimplifications   The Netherlands and Belgium (the Low Countries / Lage Landen) are a relatively new concept. There were no Belgium (BE) or The Netherlands (NL) in the middle ages. You had Flanders and some Dutch duchies like Holland or Utrecht. They were however connected in language, Diets (Middle Dutch).   That changed when the Habsburgers got control of the Low Counties in the 16th century (I'm ignoring the independent bisdoms). Fillip II, king of Spain, had control but due to bad management, religious tension and high taxes the Low Countries broke free beand declared independence. (Oversimplification)   The North what we now call The Netherlands became independent and Flanders stayed under Spanish / Habsburgian rule. Skip ahead until the convention of Vienna, Napoleon was defeated and the monarchies were carving up Europe. In this turbulent time of revolution, war and crumbling empires, The United Netherlands were formed.   It was an economic powerhouse due to the combination of the Wallonian industry and the Dutch trading power lead. But there was one problem. The southern Netherlands (present day BE)  was filled with dissent, the French speaking nobility, the Catholic Church and liberal politicians hated the King. He wanted to make Dutch the one language, institute religious freedom and was a despot.   These factors eventually coincided in an uprising in Brussels. At first it was just a cry for more self control but it radicalised when the army showed up. Suddenly the Southern Netherlands wanted to break of. How they succeeded is still a mystery to me but they did. Then they wasted their potential on infighting. I hate the Belgian Revolt"

Now the fun part begins   Now, this answer is in fact "Neither one of the objects doesn't contain heaven. English language thought us that "Neither objects don't contain" or "Both objects don't contain" are the same answer. They have the same meaning in this proposition. So, if you think about it, the truth telling parrot in front of hell's door can reply instead of "both" with "neither" also.    This makes your argument invalid, because it implies that the lie telling bird will tell you the truth, that neither one of the objects contain heaven."

funny,"I am going to have to disagree... respect is earned, not a given.   Just like someone who is rude or arrogant does not deserve my respect through behavior, someone who dresses in a way they know will draw attention garners only the respect I would give someone who behaves that way.   That said I am not implying it excuses raping someone, but honestly, I don't wear 80's running shorts and a mesh tank top because I know what kind of response that would garner.  However if I did wear that, it would be very out of line for me to be angy at people for looking at me doing it.   I respect their right to dress how they like as long as it does not directly harm me but they need to respect my right to respond in a way that does not directly hurt them."
funny,"I agree with the kid.   Let me explain: I learned more from watching Magic School Bus, Bill Nye, etc than I did in grade school. In the past school was used to give knowledge and information but in today's age information is readily available at our fingertips.   Therefore the role of schools should change from giving kids facts for rote memorization to teaching kids how to think better, appreciate knowledge and foster resourcefulness.   Sadly, this is not the case and often it is the kids with the best memory that score well on tests because intelligence and insightfulness is not scored."

funny,"I somehow ended up a graphic designer of sorts after working for a guy doing some basic labouring. I could work out what I was doing with most things, so ended up doing some basic layout work and vinyl cutting. I suggested an upgrade to the adobe suite and learnt that. Then seeing as though there was someone who could do all this stuff, we bought a CNC and large format printer and so on. Now pretty much all I do is design work, and have to have the same damn conversation every time.   "I'm a graphic designer" "No I didnt do that at uni" "No, I'm not artistic." "Yeah, I dont know why I'm doing it either."   More often than would be expected I'm talking to someone who did design at uni, or has a sister, girlfriend, friend, brother who did.... and doesn't have a job.   I couldn't art myself out of a wet paper bag... My qualifications consist of a few years of chemical engineering which I'm getting back to so I can get a real job. I don't mention the real job part to the people who want mine."
funny,"I didn't downvote ya, but I'm sure those that did have a variety of reasons including:     This is not "funny". I'd say it'd fit better in "cute" or "aww" or maybe even "pics".  Heck, there may be a half dozen other places it would fit better than funny.     The reason many people get upset with re-posts isn't simply because it's been here before, but because all it takes is a simple 10 second effort on the part of the poster to see this (and thus prevent the re-post).  People are upset when people are lazy.  Here's the results I got when I did a 10 second search here.  gets re-posted several times each month.       Again, I agree that some people may need to relax a bit, but here's how I look at such things here:   To many, Reddit is like the local Piano Lounge on the outskirts of a Touristy town.  This particular Piano Lounge has a jukebox that allows people to upload and share their own appropriate songs.  The large crowd of regulars and locals take delight in sharing their unique finds ,broadening their horizons, and stroking their egos with their classy music.  And every night, a small group of tourist walks into the lounge for the first time.  They come in talking loudly, dressed oddly, and bumping into people as they make their way straight to the jukebox. And then they proceed to pick "Piano Man" by Billy Joel to play.  They think it's a great song. They enjoy it. The group of people they walked in with enjoy it and think it's the most clever thing ever (Piano Man playing in a Piano Bar? How awesome!). They laugh loudly, sing along, and then stumble out into the night never to be seen again.  But not before pumping $5 more into the jukebox and selecting Piano Man to repeat 5 more times.  Clearly, the regulars don't find this as entertaining.  And because of this, there are signs hanging above the jukebox and posted all around the Lounge.  They say "please check before picking a song to play""

funny,"Although I do agree for the most part, I'd like to raise a few points.   YES, Quebec universities have the lowest tuition fees in all of North America. Also, students graduating from these universities are proud to say that their education is as good if not better than the education given elsewhere in the world.   So wait. Where's the loophole? Did Quebec universities figure out a way to offer an equivalent education for approximately 1/4 of the tuition fees in the rest of Canada? 1/5 and sometimes more than the tuition fees in the US? Absolutely not. Let's just put a few APPROXIMATE numbers to the situation. The average Quebec university tuition will be around $3 000/year, whereas the average Canadian university tuition will be around $10 000/year. So keeping in mind that Quebec university students (including me) get an equivalent quality of education, the question is WHERE DOES THE REMAINING $7 000 COME FROM??   The government. The government gives universities approximately $7 000 per student per year!! The University of Quebec in Montreal (UQ脌M) alone has 40 000 students!   Therefore, I don't think we should mind paying, theoretically, fractionally more for our education which will last us the rest of our lives. Especially when you consider that this money will go straight to us students and not to patch up potholes."
funny,"Continued...   Personally, if the freeze in tuition does pass, I wouldn't mind either. Because I am 100% independent, which means that I pay for my school, my apartment, food, transit... everything. I also do not have any school, loan, or credit debt. I manage this because I work my ass off, often managing a full time work load and course load.   What I find discouraging with the student mobilization is that a large chunk of these students are parading down the street in their Canada Goose jackets and taking pictures of each other with iPhones will sipping their Starbucks coffees to keep warm. I have absolutely no problems with the actual products, but I mean... come on.   Also a large chunk of these students have their tuition paid for by their parents and aren't working.   The lower tuition fees have been designed to give a greater access to higher education, not for students to take advantage of it. I have a hard time finding somebody's plea relevant when they are in the 6th year of a 3-year bachelor program.   Two years ago, I was caught in a strike that forced us to cancel our semester with no refund. It sucked. However, it's not the University's fault. It's the fault of whoever was on strike.   SO, my message to the student strikers: If you aren't happy, study hard, get better grades so you can get the fuck out. Also, don't complain when you are given the opportunity to better your education which will have an impact on the rest of your lives."
funny,"Any generalized use of the word "idiot" is a pretty enormous turn-off for me. My guess is, this girl is not especially intelligent, is self-conscious about that fact and, consequently, compensates by writing off people who disagree with her as "idiots". I've noticed that Glenn Beck loves doing this, i.e.  Arguing With Idiots , but it's pretty common among militant atheists too."

funny,"My freshman year of college I had a roommate who liked to jerk off a lot.  I would always come back to the room and he would fling a blanket over himself and slam his laptop shut. I learned pretty quickly to intentionally fumble with my keys as I made my way back into the room to give him notice of my intent to interrupt his masturbation time.   One fine Sunday I was laying in bed watching TV when I notice my roommate get up and leave. About 10 minutes went by when I started to get hungry as I hadn't eaten anything yet. Now, due to the location of my room, the lounge of that floor of the dorm was clearly visible. In fact from my side of the room you can see directly into the big bay windows of the lounge. So when I stood up that fateful day I made the mistake of glancing into the lounge where before my very eyes I saw my roommate laying down behind a couch in the lounge pressed up against the glass of the window with his dick out, fapping without a care in the world.   Now, I had caught him jerking it many times before, but this was the first time I ever made eye contact with his dick. I quickly lost my appetite and decided to just get out of the building and go for a walk. I was gone for about an hour and on my way back I hatched my scheme. When I walked back into the room he was there. I knew he hadn't seen me before so I began my rehearsed dialog: "Dude, you will never guess what I saw! While you were out I stood up and saw someone laying in the lounge jerking off!" he then turned around with his face bright red and said "what?" so I said "I didn't see his face, but he had the tiniest dick I have ever seen!! Can you imagine what kind of sick fuck it takes to do something like that?!" He was utterly speechless from then on out.   For the rest of the short time that I lived with him I made sure to tell the story anytime any of my friends were in the room, even though they had already heard the story and knew that my roommate was the perpetrator. I got to enjoy the shame in his face every time."
funny,"There  is  a card catalog buried deep in the recesses of the library, but it has signs all over it saying that it hasn't been updated since 1989.  I've only ever seen one particular man who must be about 70 wander over to the drawers and try to use it.  More power to him, I suppose."
funny,"I would like to let my opinion sink in on this situation.   I don't understand why saying that someone who is fat is gross is a problem. Being fat is (in most circumstances) a decision. If you would like to be fat then why are you getting upset when people call you fat ? If you don't want to be fat stop blaming advertisements or poor self esteem for your problems.   I don't understand why there is any debate on this. I am not saying that everyone needs to be a supermodel or super attractive, but there is no reason to think that someone who is this overweight is not to blame for their body.   There is no actual legal reason to stay skinny, and I do not think there should be. But I do not understand how people can get upset about getting called fat when they are."
funny,"Well, sort of. You can't see how someone answered a question on OKC unless you have also answered it. And you can't change your answer within 24 hours of answering or changing. And you can only see questions they've marked as public. It would work  ok , until the first date probably. The bottom line really is meeting people and actually creating your own opinion about them can't be replaced by a questionnaire."
funny,"Answer all the questions one day, find someone with most of their answers public, then come back the next day and match theirs.  Both situations are still the same, someone is faking interest and deceiving the other, and it will probably fall apart when they actually get together."
funny,"I'm ... not really sure what you're trying to achieve in asking that question, but I'll take a stab at it.   You don't have to hate pedophiles to agree that children need to be protected. Hating pedophiles has led to a mass hysteria that's resulted in the over protection of children (protecting them from the big bad wolf, and major over alert on stranger danger). There's no justification for harming a child. Nor is there justification for destroying the lives of someone who's peed, drunk, next to a play ground at 3am. Or prosecuting a 17 year old for sending nude pictures of themselves to someone (or receiving them from their underage girl/boyfriend).   The horrific reality of sexual abuse is that it's pretty rarely strangers who do it. Your kid is  far  more likely to be molested by a close relative or family friend than they are to be abducted off the street.   Instead, "protect the children!" has become the battle cry that has allowed ill-thought out legislation, not only causing people convicted and branded as pedophiles to have no place to legally live (forcing them to live in colonies under bridges, for instance), but also allowing a lot of other nasty stuff to happen. We need to get the fuck out of our knee-jerk reactionary mindset and start thinking through this stuff practically."

But, i loved that cat. And she was fine."

As a result Sir Tophamhat had to buy "special coal" presumably with a higher heating value so that it burned hotter. See this [Wikipedia link]( for more detail.

funny,"Hi r/funny. Let me explain karmac's comment. FOV means field of view. Basically, it means the angle that you can see at once without moving your head.   A human being has a huge field of vision, something like 120-180 degrees (it depends on your definitions). You can see stuff in your peripheral vision that is basically at a right angle to the direction you are looking.   But if you tried to stuff a humans' entire field of vision into a single flat monitor, it'd look all warped around the edges, like a Mercator projection. Most FPS use a field of view of around 75-90, and much less in the vertical direction. That's why you don't see the whole arm when you play a FPS. In real life, it would be in your peripheral vision. But your peripheral vision is cut off in the game.   So that guy in the first pic is not holding the gun up to his face. he's holding his arm outstretched, but the arm is cut off by the narrow field of vision."
funny,"Double bounce boss here!  I used to be a fat kid with a trampoline in the back yard and learned my epic powers early in life.  After perfecting the double bounce I went on to other things.  After college myself and my fianc茅 were visiting my parents and that old trampoline was still there:  sun bleached and rusty springs.  My kind of party haha.  I jump on and goad my lady to follow who after seeing me take a few big bounces jumps on.  She's about 100# soaking wet and I'm about 200# at the time.  So we start jumping and having fun.  I do a "sumo sit". Where you basically jump really high and kick your legs out to land on your butt.  I do many of them and they are great fun.  I'm beat at this point and jump off the trampoline. She's still jumping and wants to try a sumo sit but she's nervous so I goad her on.  She finally does one and her butt blasts straight though the trampoline onto the ground.  I felt so bad after laughing historically for 15 minutes and checking to see if she was fine.  That moment will forever be one of the funniest things I've ever seen.  Btw she was fine besides a grass stain."
funny,"Now, although I know that this IS fake, it's not what bothers me about it.   It's the fact that the conversation is so blunt and simple, yet obviously comes across with a distinct fake feeling. Nobody talks like this. It's like watching a movie where you just feel how the sentences in a conversation are just like a beat on a drum. No improvisation or changes whatsoever.   Anywho, it bothers me just like when someone puts more than one exclamation point at the end of sentence. Actually, any exclamation points. It just feels fake and a desperate plea for attention"
funny,"Wow, that's actually kind of a dick move.  I've had that happen.  Cashier dropped (among other things) my apples.  On the floor.  Picked them up and rang them in.  I (politely) said I didn't want them any more.  I think her manager was watching, because she just said she'd be back, and ran off for a few seconds.  Came back with "new" apples for me, and I thanked her profusely for being so nice.  Turns out they weren't new apples, as most of them now had large mushy spots.  And I'm pretty sure she dropped them a couple extra times just because I was so rude as to not want crushed apples.  The part that really pissed me off, is that I wasn't the one who noticed, it was my son, who took one in his lunch to school.  So, his lunch was shorted by her ignorant behavior.  Bonus points: she charged me twice for the apples."
funny,"My favourite is as follows: Customer: "oi mate, you got any of these out back" Me: "I'll just check for you sir" I go to have a look like a good little employee, and because I actually know what I'm doing, check all places I know the product may be before returning to the customer I'm serving.  Me: "sorry sir, outof stock at the moment, it should be arriving on our delivery tomorrow, sorry about that" Customer: " ain't no good tomorrow" Cue him walking off in a huff.  2 minutes after, I'm approached by another member of staff asking me about the product I've just been looking for.  Apparently the customer asked 2 more people after I told him it was out of stock, and complained about my service to management.  I guess he didn't like the cut of my jib"

funny,"Probably a long unneccesart story but I'm going to tell it because maybe someone out there will read it and share my pain: I grew up in Indiana and learned the foil method like most normal people and then my junior year of HS moved to North Carolina where they used a whole different method called the box method. To me, this method is a lot easier but it wasn't at the time and I had a really rough time grasping it and had to basically relearn all of algebra because of it. Basically everything my new teacher did was backwards from what I had learned in the Midwest (it wasn't just foil that was different, he introduced a lot of new ways to do stuff that I had previously done). This really wasn't the problem, but when it got into more complicated stuff, the fact that I was doing stuff so differently made it difficult to follow lessons. And then when I moved to another school my senior year I was moved back to the foil method. Which sucked and I just said fuck it because I was not going to relearn that shit."
funny,"So then what is the difference between diffraction and light bloom?  Diffraction is what causes "starbursts" in long exposures with small apertures, and light bloom is related to bokeh which causes light areas to expand when out-of-focus light is behind a dark subject.  My understanding of it is: Diffraction happens at the aperture, behind the lens and causes "rays" having the same number of angles as the number of blades in the camera aperture. Bloom is simply an out of focus backround/foreground which causes points of light in the image to become circles of light.  Unless you mean that his finger wasn't doing the diffracting, but the edges of the camera optics were.  [Diffraction](  [Bloom and/or Bokeh]("

funny,"the tapered mag leads to one side, that just does not make sense and the 1911's magwell  does not have total clearance all the way to the front of the grip. Note also that the barrel of a 1911 clears the frame of the gun and yet that is not visible. I would not discount the fact that either are fakes, in fact I believe they are."
funny,"I think so, here's my reasoning..  Two numbers share a divisor if the same number, let's say 4, can go into both numbers. Another way to think about that is that the same number, added to itself a lot, makes the other numbers (so each number would be a bunch of 4s). So in the case of 12 and 44, they share the devisor of 4; 4 3 and 4 11. 11(4)-3(4)=8(4).  To think about it algebraically, any two different amounts of x will equal another amount of x. So in the case above, 11x-3x=8x.  So to test out of two numbers have a common divisor which you can factor out and cancel out [44/12=4(11)/4(3)=11/3], you can subtract one number from the other one.  However this is only really useful when you have two numbers that aren't easily factorable in your head, but when you subtract one from another one, you get a number that is.  Did that help?"

funny,"Once, ten years ago, I noticed a can of cheap, generic brand orange soda had been in my work fridge, un-drunk, for weeks. On one incredibly hot day (summer in Sydney, AU in a building with no AC) I thought, "fuck it", went into the kitchen and chugged the can as fast as I could before anyone came in and caught me drinking someone else's soda. I hid the empty can underneath some other trash in the trash can. The perfect crime.   As I sat back at my desk, I thought about how refreshing the soda was and thought to myself; "who would buy that cheap orange soda in this office? Only person I know who would buy it is... my... Mum"   It was then I realised; it was my soda. I brought it in and forgot about it weeks ago."

It also gave the added benefit that he'd enjoy the Pepsi on the way down and the way back up!   Unfortunately, Mr. [Thief] stole OP's Pepsi before OP could drink it and ingested the ipepsicac."
funny,"I remember in 5th grade we were learning the 50 states.  I was a history/geography kid when I was younger, so I knew the 50 states from reading the book, but had never actually said each state.  I had missed the day our teacher went over all 50 states, but came in the next day when they entire class was going over them. We had to say each out loud. Well, when everyone went to say Arkansas, I said Are-Kansas (because hell, it looks that way). Teacher stopped and kids turned around (my last name starts with a z, so I'm always in the back) and just stared at me. Then the teacher made me say Arkansas five times in front of the class to teach me 2 lessons, one to not skip class and two: learn how to say the name correctly.  Didn't learn lesson one though ;)"

You go through life, with all likely hood that you'll pretty much benefit from every government program and expenditure (such as schools, healthcare, military defense, economic regulations etc) for the vast majority of these services most people have already benefited from in some way, and if they haven't they're pretty much garaunteed to at some point. Through all of these benefits you've been able to lead a productive life and earn (hopefully) a good amount of money, then you re contribute some of that money so those programs can be maintained, not just for you but the children born after you who should damn well get the same benefits you did.   I Know the thought of the government leeching off your income and such might be painful, but they've made thatt income possible (and in a lot of ways made you being alive a possibility) and now you have to repay your debt to society, AKA, Pay taxes.   And you only need to look at a few examples to realize Free Market isn't good for everything, free market is brutally effective, but greedy and inefficient, Government run programs are (typically) more efficient, and that's why in countries like England, we pay a fraction of what an American would to health care companies, through tax, and receive a better service.

funny,"Honestly, regardless of opinions for or against this particular piece of legislation, this is my biggest complaint with modern politics.   We (the general population) are not educated enough to understand how to fix a widespread problem, such as the so-called healthcare crisis. So, as our democracy is set up, we elect officials that should more more specifically educated to fix these problems. The problem is, politicians know that we aren't very good at knowing whether a proposed solution will actually work, so we begin to pick the person who is able to explain the problems with the system. The problem is, picking out the problems in a system is much easier than providing a solution to said problems. So the politicians are not held accountable for the kinds of solutions they put forth, but rather that they did in fact put forth solutions.   It is striking how many Democratic politicians did not approve of this piece of legislation. It's disproportionate to the amount of Democratic voters who say they support it. I think this comes from the bulk of the voters being uneducated on solution since the president didn't need to put forth specifics during the election. I'm sure he made sweeping statements about some of the traits that are included, but we didn't know the specifics. But these are just observations."
funny,"intolerant   I don't think that word means what you think it means.   When is the last time atheists started a lobby against religious rights? Fired an employee for being Christian? Threw someone out of their restaurant for saying a prayer over their meal? Or advocated actual violence against the religious? Never. Fucking. Happened.   Disrespectful, maybe. Intolerant? Not so much.   But the meat of the matter is much more simple. A good demonstration would be to ask whether it is the case, that when someone pushes you and you push back, are both you being "pushy"? Atheism itself has no substance. It is a response, a counter point to rampant misconduct by theism as a force in our society. Without something to criticize, the entire "new atheism" movement is entirely meaningless.   Criticism of a reaction must always consider the cause of that reaction, and whether or not such a reaction is warranted. In this case, calling someone an idiot for propping up a corrupt dogma construct engaging in despicable acts ranging from the introduction of creationism to the science curriculum to denying people equal rights based on their beliefs, gender or sexuality... well, I think that's reasonable."
funny,"Art is about the hardest thing to categorize in terms of good and bad. To consider one work or artist as dominate over another comes down to personal opinion. Sure some things maybe blatantly better than other works, but it ultimately lies with the individual. I personally enjoy the work of "street artists" (using quotations not to be sarcastic, but mainly because this is in a different category than graffiti and since my background is not in art I don't know what the "proper" term is , if there is one), but I do see where you are coming from. CLET tends to use the same images continuously (to a point where one could say "Is this it?") as do most street artists (I do think this term is thrown around a lot more than it should be, I agree with you there) and it can be annoying."
funny,"I graduated from the University of Colorado, a pretty well known drinking school.  Every year it seems they would have graduation earlier and earlier to try and curb pre-graduation drinking.  My year, it was at 7am. Needless to say, the bars were open at around 5am.  I was able to fit in my fair share of drinking, but there were others who got in an entire days worth in those 2 hours.  As we all lined up and funneled into the stadium single file, almost the entire graduating class passed a poor soul who had made it almost the entire way into the stadium only to pass out cold and hit his head on the concrete.  When I passed him there were paramedics treating his head wound and he still didn't appear conscious.   To this day, I wonder about what happened to that kid and to his parents and extended family.  If they were anything like mine, they had flown in from across the country just to see their child walk across that stage.  This guys parents would hear their child's name called and be puzzled as to where he was, only to find out later he was in the hospital with a head wound, a hangover, and the collective shame of the entire family.  OP, At least you weren't that guy."

funny,"I've long said that Twilight is a tragic case of an awesome plot and a shitty author.   Caution: Spoiler warning!   Twilight : Girl falls in love with a vampire whose coven abstains from human blood. Her blood is particularly tempting to him, so every moment they spend together puts him in great pain and her in great danger. When a passing vampire decides to use Bella for a sadistic game, he convinces her he's kidnapped her mother and she goes willingly to him. He starts beating her up by throwing her around in a ballet studio and bites her, only to be saved at the last minute by Edward and his family. Edward sucks the venom out so he doesn't condemn her to immortality. Oh, and he can read minds but not hers and their first date is a result of him saving her from rapists.   New Moon : We learn that her best friend Jacob is a werewolf and that the shape-shifting of his tribe stems from an ancient rivalry between his tribe and the vampires, though they have a treaty with the Cullens. In an effort to keep her safe from potential danger of vampires Edward leaves, and Jacob becomes her rock through the ensuing depression. Bella starts taking risks to get an adrenaline rush and "see" Edward. When she jumps off a cliff for that reason, his future-seeing seeing sister believes she has killed herself. Bella must fly to Italy and stop him from stepping into the sun so that he will be killed but the "kings" of the vampire world, a cult-like ancient group called the Volturi. Edward then returns with Bella so as not to lose her again.   Eclipse : The sadistic vampire that Edward killed in the first book had a mate, who has been creating an army of volatile newborn vampires in Seattle to come and kill Bella to avenge her mate. The Cullens have an uneasy alliance with the werewolves to protect her, and the Volturi allow the army to come. We learn about their political motivation and their desire to take the super-powered Cullens and use them for further control. The newborn army is defeated and Bella cuts herself to distract Victoria (the vamp girlfriend) so that Edward can defeat her. Not even getting into the love triangle between Jacob, Bella, and Edward.   Breaking Dawn : They get married and she experiences a hyperspeed pregnancy where the incompatible fetus is draining the nutrition from her body, forcing her to drink blood to sustain herself. The baby kills her during birth, but she is saved at the last minute by Edward's venom. Believing that the child is an "immortal child" (dangerous vampires that stay children and are killed on sight) rather than a half-vampire child, the Volturi are coming to slaughter the Cullens. They must gather witnesses to make the Volturi hear them out: vampire friends from all over the word. An Egyptian coven brings someone who can manipulate the elements, amazonian vampires with someone who can change what you see, fellow "vegetarian vampires" have someone that can physically shock you, Jasper brings friends from his days in the Civil War but he and Alice mysteriously disappear, and nomadic vampires from all over join them. All of  that  is compounded by the fear of the child's speedy growth and the lack of information on her future, which Alice can not see. There is a final standoff that I don't want to spoil.   All of the Cullens have interesting and dynamic back stories, and so do some of the werewolves. With a strong female lead and a better author, Twilight could have been fucking awesome."

funny,"I'm not a neurolog so take this with a grain of salt, the way brains creates "knowledge" is by neurons creating a connection between them. So if a bigger brain means more neurons then the maximum number of connections increases, however note that the maximum number of connections is faculty (!) of the number of neurons, so to give an example 55! is more then 10^73 so given a billion neurons the maximum number of connections is beyond our comprehension of numbers."

They can't get jobs because the wealthy white minority literally set up the country in such a way as to keep the black population poor and powerless. The only reason white Africans were able to dominate their country's majority was because of military power, itself the result of a technological legacy originating with the Islamic empire of the "Golden Age"... The Golden Age drew on knowledge from the Greeks, who got that knowledge from Persia and Egypt, who had the means to gather said knowledge because of a legacy that FUCKING STARTED IN BLACK FUCKING AFRICA.

funny,"People are so freaking paranoid...   Can anyone tell me, besides the legal reasons, why Marriage is important? Does anyone spiritually sincerely believe dancing in circles in front of dead gods will legitimize a bond that you feel for another human being? There is no boundary which keeps people, in the afterlife or without, together that could expresses love any more or less. The act of marriage is a tradition which solidifies possession over individuals, which doesn't sound like, "to honor, to cherish". Inviting family and friends, however wonderful a community gathering could be, is a con for gifts and to ward off any male or female predators. The only joy I could possibly foresee is the Bride's, "One Day", but that is reinforcing a HUGE negative social stereotype which is capturing the absolute beauty of a woman in her prime, her aesthetics, and her youth. After that day, THAT'S IT! Either back to yoga to keep up obsessing over a wedding dress that you will never wear again for the rest of your life or always wondering if you could COMPARE TO YOUR WEDDING DAY. You know the most beautiful I've ever seen a woman? It was after my buddy's kid was born. His partner was so freaking beautiful in intention, motivation, and was in complete aww over a tangible journey which lead to the most beautiful life on this planet. But when she got out of the hospital, only myself and their parents were there to help and be a part of their lives. I wouldn't say that they need to rush the couple, but the community could do more for the lives of those they supposedly cherish than to sit, kneel, stand, aww, eat, drink, dance, cheers, and go home. I would want people involved in the most important moments in my partner's and my lives rather than creating an intangible moment to the dead gods to ward off any other male predators so that I could, how did you put it, "lock that down".   Legally, makes sense. That's a commitment. Spiritually, unless it's deeply personal and a completely intimate connection with everyone involved, not a fucking preacher you've met twice before and to impress your Bosses Boss or your distant Aunt that lent you some money because she has no children of her own and, "It would be nice to give her some attention, considering...", then what's the point.   Shit, since I'm already on this rant, Sex. Fuck people before marriage. The body is sacred, which is why you SHOULD test drive it before "committing to owning". The reason is not because you should know how it feels, (because it feels pretty fucking good or it's awful, never really a middle ground about it), but because in those soft, silent moments after is the ground which make the earth tremble, the moments of bliss which will sincerely connect you to your partner. God DAMN nothing feels better than having finished mutually and then discussing about your lives, fears, woes, joys, memories, expectations, and hopes. Worst case, if the relationship doesn't work out. then you have come to understand better who 'you' wish to be better and with 'whom' you wish to be better with! WHAT A FUCKING CONCEPT!   Do you wish to commit to the partner that you love? Get legally whatever makes you safe from society, and then commit to each other in the knowledge that, no matter how ever much you both change, that the only person in this world that is important enough to share it with is your partner. No "official notice", no community peer pressure, but by acknowledging the joy you both feel for one another every single day, because through the uncertainty of life, there is a stronger love for those who know rather than who need evidence... scratch that... who need a shiny rock as proof rather than the boundless experiences of every day with each other as evidence of your commitment towards one another.   I'm going to love my partner so much when I get home.   Then we'll play with our pet Chinchilla as she bites our toes and hides in our blanket as we snuggle on the floor while we watch M.A.S.H. (RADAR!), then after sweeping, cleaning out her cage, and finishing the dishes, we'll fall asleep in each other's arms, knowing that this was also the happiest day of our entire lives as well, and looking forwards to tomorrow."

funny,"EDIT: looks like I got carried away and missed the point. Do infact chew aspirin as soon as you call 911. It prevents the bloodcloth from growing.   You won't get high from aspirin so there is no need to get it in your bloodstream as fast as possible. Except maybe if you suffer from a migraine attack but then I wouldn't recomment aspirin anyway. Bypassing the firstpass effect of a pharmaceutical product designed for oral ingestion is never a good idea. It can result in much higher blood concentrations than intended. Unless you wanna get high, then it's adviseable to alter the route of ingestion so your liver won't destroy all the precious molecules before they even arrive in the brain.   Acetylsalicylic acid (as in aspirin) inhibits an enzyme called cyclooxygenase. It's involved in the formation of bloodplatelets. If you have less aggregating platelets, you lower the risk of bloodcloths forming somewhere in your body. Which could travel through your bloodstream and get stuck in your coronary arteries.   However the same enzyme is also responsible for acid management in the stomach.  Chronic use of acetylsalicylic acid in high dosages like in aspirin will significantly increase the risk of stomach ulcers and -cancer.   There are formulations of acetylsalicylic acid with low dosage specially designed to lower the risk of heart attacks with little to no effects on the stomach.   Trust me I'm a scientist."

funny,"This is so sad! Maybe my vet office is just super awesome but i think finding the right vet is a key in making sure your dogs aren't terrified.   I have 2 dogs, a lab mix and a chihuahua mix. When we first got the lab as a puppy, we brought him to the vet that the humane society recommended and he wasn't ever happy about going.   That, on top of a recurring problem the vet always had the same "solution" to, made us decide to change.   We brought him to the new vet and they whole staff is just so nice and personable.   They have 3 vets but I usually see just one and the others as back-up. I feel like my vet genuinely loves my dogs and the vets that don't see them regularly seem to really care about them, and I think my dogs can tell this and know they are safe there. They are not just another chart/patient, they are pets/friends/family.   When I bring my dogs in, the receptionists greet them, talks to them, has them weighed and then gets us in a room where a nice vet tech talks to us, gives them scratches, talks more, and takes their temp and gives them a treat. Then after a bit, the vet comes in and talks to to us, plays with them a bit of it's just a routine check up, gives them sooo many treats. If they need shots, the vet techs administer them quickly and talk and treat as they do it and if there's an exam, the vet has techs come in and talk and pet/hold/treat while he does it.   Even my small dog, who is afraid of nearly everything (from brooms and lampshades to falling leaves and bicycles) and is VERY untrusting of people in general, loves the vet.   They don't do anything super special like baking cookies but my dogs are always happy to go to the vet. Sometimes when I'm walking them, they try and turn towards the vet clinic (it's super close). When I'm there, I never feel rushed. My vet always takes the time to fully explain things, even if he has to draw pictures and use diagrams. He understands we are on a budget and will sometimes "forget" to add stuff to the bill, like when our lab tore his cruciate ligament and he had a $2000 dollar surgery at the same time our small dog was getting spayed. He cut off $100 for the anaesthesia and $100 for the overnight stay and the 3 follow ups. He also gave us the small one's pain meds for free and included a ton extra for Hershey because he knew they'd need it. Oh, and he cleaned their teeth for almost half off, since they were already under anaesthetic and it was dental month (normally 20% off).   My only regret is he can't treat people."

I honestly feel like I might at some point, in the future, travel back to the past and get the job of whoever wrote this and wind up being the guy who writes it myself, since it's exactly the kind of thing I would do.   On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning. Choose sitting on that couch watching mind-numbing sprit-crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself.

Face facts, everyone- if you are attracted to a woman who shows no interest, "friendzone"ed or whatever is jsut a polite way of saying "Move the fuck on."   Which you should do. Quit making yourself miserable, get the fuck out of the basement, and find  someone  that you can make as happy as they make you."
funny,"That's how it worked with a coworker.  She was stringing me along and playfully touching me and such.  Then she said she felt things were going in the wrong direction, and we should keep things on a friend-level.  This is also when I found out she lied about being engaged, and I told her to fuck-off and just leave me alone.   After a week of straight-up eye-contact ignoring her anytime she'd come around and address me, she started flirting a bit sexual and said something like, "I have naked pictures on my phone, which one should I send you?"   Still didn't say anything, just held out my hand, she gave me her phone, went through them and said, "All of them."   Long story short, adulterous sex.  It was about 14-months after my first sexual encounter, so I was really in an oddly depressed and manic emotional place.   Looking back, I kind of think she just really enjoyed my company.  She was probably so lonely in her relationship that when I cut off all interaction with her, she did whatever it took to keep me around."
funny,"It seems to me that guys that this whole idea of a friend zone exists almost exclusively with dudes who are incapable of having girls as actual genuine friends. My partner and I started out as friends and we've been together for seven years. This is very true for many other couples we know. I hate all this advice that you have to be aggressive and emotionally forceful with a girl up front if you want your interactions to be romantically charged lest you want to fall into the dreaded "friend zone". Wouldn't you want your romantic partner to also be someone you'd be friends with? If not, then you probably don't deserve the romantic attention you think you're owed. Believe it or not, your friendship can be a spark for something way bigger. It can be a slow burn. Have you ever been around that Plain Jane that got a little cuter every day as you got to know her better and then one day noticed you were all of the sudden very attracted to her? It can work like that for girls as well. People don't always know how they feel about someone else and being desperate and forcing your object of affection into making up their mind about how they feel about you is almost universally unattractive. Treat girls like people - they are not some formulas to be solved. Sometimes you may have to make a move, and sometimes you may have to be bold, but sometimes there are attractive friend-quality members of the opposite sex and you'll have to come to grips with that fact. Also, having members of the opposite sex in your close friend group tends to show that you are able to maintain different types of relationships and can be an asset in your quest for romance. I've seen my girl buddies play some astonishingly effective wingman roles for my guy friends over the years when they are interested in someone. Attraction often comes about when someone sees how another person interacts in a group and can heighten curiosity of what that person is like away from the group as well."
funny,"OK guys, this is a funny cute post but fuck.   The "friend-zone" pisses me off to no end. It basically fucking implies that a chick wanting to be your friend is an awful thing.  Like maybe she wanted to be your friend because your a nice and interesting person and she wants to share her life with you?  Just because she doesn't have a romantic relationship with you means that she can't talk to you and being nice to you is  leading you on ...   OH FUCK NO-- if you're not getting it in then it's not worth being her friend.  So basically the only reason you fucking approached her is cause you view her as a sack o' meat, a hot lil' thing to satifsy your dickdongdangler?  And then you have the fucking  nerve  to get pissed when she doesn't reciprocate?   Maybe all she wants to do is chill and play fucking Mario Party with you, butttt NOOO since shes attractive she  must  want your tongue in her throat.   I just. Can't. EVEN.

If sexy time happens hooray, if it doesn't hooray as well cause you got a new buddy to drink beers with and talk to.

funny,"The local businesses do typically continue to operate, albeit at a a reduced level.  No matter your clientele, there will be those that go to the lowest possible price.  This results in substandard labor environments and a severe pay crunch for employees at smaller locations, leading to downsizings, exacerbating the issue of diminished ability to provide customer service.   This is a combined issue with walmart skirting around legal price fixing.   When walmart buys whole chickens from tyson, for example, the negotiator for walmart (yes, that's how purchasing works on a large scale) essentially tells the tyson representative assigned to corporate, "Look, walmart buys "blah" percentage of your total chicken sales for the year, so we want them at this price.  Say no, and we'll go somewhere else for our birds."   This is typically a high enough price that, logistically, tyson can't refuse.  In order to keep everything above board, tyson then makes a pricing chart to reflect walmarts' purchase size.  Arguably, no single company is going to purchase as much as the number one company on the Fortune 500, so nobody else can legitimately get that same cost.   This is called the economy of scale.

funny,"44% is actually higher than I expected. Quite frankly, that's pretty damn good. Your employer doesn't OWE you health insurance.   $10.10 an hour doesn't sound to bad to me.   I don't see any issue with the August 2006 statement. It makes sense that even if someone worked at Wal-Mart for 35 years, they wouldn't get paid $20 an hour to stock shelves. That's just crazy.   None of that justifies your statement that they are at the bottom of the barrel in terms of employee relations.   I was a manager at Target. It was a good place to work. Our best employees didn't even get 6% raises. Shit, you'd be lucky to get a 6% raise just about anywhere."

funny,"While I do agree that dogs are obviously carnivores, I believe they do need a  very small  element of fruit and veg in their diets. Looking at the wild wolf diet, we see that when a pack takes down large prey, they go right for the tasty, tasty organs, usually the stomach first. The stomach of the (usually herbivorous) prey contains somewhat-digested plant matter. Since it's already been broken down by the prey animal, the wolves can get a nutritional benefit from it. We have also been observing wolves grazing on plant matter such as grasses or fruit which has fallen from trees. That usually means they need some more fibre in their diets.   Because wolves and dogs can't process cellulose, they can't break down fruit and veg on their own, it's true. But juicing the vegetables and including the pulp in their diet will give them better access to the vegetables' nutrients, and also add fibre, which will help keep everything running smoothly in the digestive tract.   They certainly shouldn't be getting lots of plant matter, maybe 5% of their entire diet max, but if you see your dog eating grass, it probably needs some fibre. Good, and tasty, sources include pureed pumpkin and sweet potato."

IP bans wouldn't work either, because all you need to pass that is a public computer access area.  I'm probably vastly overcomplicating this, but the most effective means of a perma-ban would involve a profiling algorithm.

funny,"When I was a kid, my family and our dog (a small Pomeranian) used to live in a duplex. Our neighbors, the Potters, were good friends of ours. We would sometimes leave Blossom our on a stake with a really long leash and let her hang out outside for a while. We had a pretty large but unfenced backyard that we shared with the Potters.   So one day I  look outside the back window to check on Blossom and I see the youngest Potter kid, Kelby throwing sticks at our dog who was trapped on the stake.  [THIS]( is what a Pomeranian looks like!  The kid was about 5-7 and I was in sixth grade so probably around 12 years old. Also, Blossom wasn't hurt, but I was pissed and went outside and screamed at him to not do that. 5-7 year-olds being what they are, he was mortified at being caught and ran back into his house.   Fast forward a couple years. I'm in 8th grade. My family has moved and we now live on a lovely little street called Winterbrook Drive. I'd received a beautiful husky for my birthday not too long ago. This house had a decent sized gated backyard and the husky, Maya, ran around in it unattended all the time. Fucking  AGAIN  I look out the back window and see some asshole kids through the slats of the gate, spraying something into Maya's face. I think it may have been spray paint, I can't imagine what else it may have been, but at any rate it was aerosolized. I ran outside and asked them what the hell they were doing. There were two and one freaked out and ran away. The other stayed and said some bullshit like 'We're saying hi to your dog' or something. He and the other were older and bigger than me so I just got Maya and took here inside."
funny,"Do not joke. My neighbour two doors up thought she had rescued a stray (my cat) for 4 months. It was only figured out when my neighbour took her in to get spayed and they opened her up and found out she was already spayed and only then noticed the microchip which is a rather obvious lump on her neck region (at least to anyone who actually touches the cat). The vet phoned me at home while I was at work...and then gave MY cat back to my neighbour to look after! This was aggravating as I was on crutches with a freshly broken ankle at the time, so was unable to travel to my neighbour's and carry a cat cage home at the same time, and when I phoned my neighbour, she seemed like she wasn't even going to give her back!"

They do this because it's the campers last year as campers and it builds leadership for the next year when they become counselors. The inside of the bus looks just like a normal school bus, except that some of the seats are turned backwards to face each other and tables are put in between them. There are 4 people to a table, but only three cup holders. I have no idea where the second pic is from. How do I know it's the CLH Ranger bus?

funny,"This is not a Far Side comic.  It looks a lot like Gary Larson's work but unless this is some draft of a comic he posted it never would have made syndication or printing with the blood accompanying the bodies.  In "The Prehistory of the Far Side" he talks about comics not being published for way less than this, and actually sometimes way more than this.  His original comic was called "Nature's Way" and was much cruder and the humor a little more violent (though not violent by any really offensive standard) than The Far Side so it could possibly be from that time period..  Also Larson always talks about his editor having to send him back strips for multiple rewrites and edits just to make it to the papers because the humor was so weird or the publishers didn't get it and thought it would disturb people.   This isn't a bad simulacrum, I kind of laughed at the reference and it reminded me of my own comics, but I don't think it is a Larson original."

funny,"Interestingly, a major aspect of Darwin's Theory of Evolution is being challenged in Biology. The idea that genes are the only information holder that can spur on natural selection has been specifically contested.   Epigenetics is part of how your body regulates what genes to read and transcribe (make). Different enzymes add or subtract chemical groups to your genes to allow/prevent them to be read. These chemical marks have been proven to change throughout an individual's life span and can be induced through environmental factors (pollution, nutrient availability, etc.)   There are a few key experiments involving that acquire different chemical groups on their genes throughout their lifespan that then pass on those marks to their offspring. I'm on mobile right now so I can't post links to some of these experiments. However if you're interested try searching these:   Agouti mouse experiment Dutch hunger study Pottenger's cats   I'm not saying epigenetics truly proves Darwin wrong (again this is a really contested idea in Biology).

funny,"The main issue with your argument is that evolution isn't an explanation that says things change in this way. It's a huge field of scientific thought that seeks to map out the physical relationships of things that are (and things that were).  If we assume some sort of accurate trace of evolution back to a theoretic genesis by creator, you still have animals that show genetic markers of previous generations...   That is to say, evolution does not at all point to things starting from something complex, and many of the markers and characteristics we see in living things blow the theoretic genesis creation timeline entirely out of the water.   You could say that you think that evolution suddenly started for no reason (other than the creator explanation) as though it had been going for a while - that a creator effectively faked a giant history that's not there.  But if you're going to say that the modern scientific field of evolution and it's partner process of slow change through natural selection fits seamlessly with biblical literalism, you're going to be wrong."
funny,"This is Dr Farr at Texas State University. He's a badass dude. Oh yeah, he puts a frog in a blender on the first day of class.   Edit: a couple people asked so I'll explain further.   Dr. Farr is a master of suspense and timing, although you'd never know it to look at him. He's also a brilliant educator. On the first day of class, he wants you to learn some bio, sure, but what he really wants is for you to "find your voice". So he pulls out some plant (which i knew the genus and species now) and he asked the students if the plant is alive. The students reluctantly speak up, a few of them murmer "yea.. duh.." (more or less).   He then up-roots the plant. "Is the plant still alive?" Again, the students kinda give him the affirmative. Then he rips the plant apart into tiny pieces. Now the class isn't so sure. No one is willing to say yes, but the class is beginning to get into this little exercise. Lots more excited murmuring at this point. He walks over to the blender he has set up and blends the shit out of this plant. Its plant soup now.   "Is the plant still alive?"   The class gives a collective "No" to which Dr. Farr informs us that, in fact, there are still plant cells which are alive and totally fine. They are still undergoing mitosis and reproduction. The plant is technically still alive. Furthermore, the plant could be cloned at this stage, effectively "keeping it alive".   After the class agrees that the plant is still alive, Dr. Farr pulls out his next demonstration. He pulls out a healthy, completely live frog. (once again, i wish i could tell you the genus and species, because he makes it a point to tell a little about each organism before he blends it). The class is already getting uneasy. He began the discussion about the plant in the exact same manner. Is he going to blend this frog like he blended the plant?? He tells us about how this species of frog is the only one to have these specific claws and to do this or that or etc.   He then starts to walk over to the blender, and the first whimper from some sorority girl is heard as the rest of the class begins to fall silent. As i said, he is a master of suspense. He plays the old man card and he knows that everyone expects him to do something stupid and old-man-like. He raises the frog up to the blender and the silence is broken. People begin to freak out a bit.   "But, you said that the plant was still alive, even after i blended it! What's different about this frog??"   He's raising the frog closer and closer to the blender and the class is getting louder and louder. More and more uneasy.   PLOP!   The class erupts, all the girls are screaming for him not to blend this frog, and all the frat guys are cheering him on in a primal fashion (maybe this reaction was supposed to be our first taste of observational biology). Dr. Farr's finger hovers above the blend button as he seemingly decides whether or not to blend this frog. He lets the class freak out for a good minute or two... and then he takes the frog out. He didn't blend the frog. Happy or sad or anticlimactic, you decide!"
funny,"Ummmm..... The bachelor level is completely inadequate to even begin addressing the technological problems we run in to today in molecular fields (everything important, computers are fast now and we are now wondering what to do with them... raw computational engineering has far surpassed our ability to use it for valuable purposes). Before a decade of study, you haven't run in to the heuristics (tried-and-true practices) and situational learning required to perform relevant experiments that examine interesting, usually interfacial questions as most are today. Even professors who have not embraced -omics approaches or minimally some systems thinking, are being run out by younger people who can. ie today, half of our academic 'leaders' are doing irrelevant, unnecessary work that can be overcome en masse with better defined experiments containing more thoughtful metrics, with higher throughput nonetheless and better quantitation of assumptions, errors, and noise sources.   More people need PhDs (and proper training! not happening really in these crap labs I speak of, sadly) so they are, at least, less confused about what a waste of time and money these inadequately trained people are. Not to mention that these outdated opinions still hold tremendous sway as -omics and computational modeling are just becoming accepted as a bare minimum standard for relevant experiments."

I also had the iron belief that homework was not to take more then two pages, because this shit was assigned every day.

So, speaking literally like you are right now, does your attraction to this "catgirl" make you a furry? You know she's a fantasy of a human woman. I know she's a fantasy of a human woman. Let's not pretend I'm making huge leaps here when I say this reflects very messed up attitudes toward females."
funny,"Anytime I have to be in and out somewhere like a grocery store or if I have to pee really bad (pregnant), I'll park allllllllllll the way in the back and fuck parking correctly because even if I'm in there for an hour, the spaces around me are still empty. Most people are too damn lazy to walk the distance. Sometimes I'll park on the side of the building where no one thinks to park. I ALWAYS find fast and conveniently close parking on the side."
funny,"That Camaro Z/28 is a pretty astonishing car. It's big and heavy but the project was essentially designed entirely around its tires. It has the largest front tires ever mounted to a production car.   It also uses race-proven carbon ceramic brakes, which are typically a $15K option on sports cars if they're offered at all.   And it comes equipped with some pretty exotic race tech: spool valve shocks. They were used on only one other street car, the $1.4M Astin Martin One 77."
funny,"Camaro owner here, I hate guys like that that give us a bad name. Double parking is a dick move. This is hilarious.   On the flip side I take care of my car like it were a religion, so I've been door dinged before (just recently) and it freakin sucks."
funny,"Full disclosure... I used to be one of these special kinds of people, and it wasn't even a sports car. It was 2003 Focus. It was the first time I had a newish car, and it was an SVT! Man was I paranoid about door dings. Who knew that a newish car could be so stressful! You own a car without scratches and dents! How could this be?? So I visited my girlfriend at the time who lives in a condo complex, and I did it... I took two spots. I was a badass... that car was RED! I'm allowed two spots just for that, right? And there weren't many cars in the lot. I go inside, spend a few hours doing relationshippy things, and then it's time to go. It's dark, but I know where I'm going... straight to my bright red badass machine! I do the haters gonna hate walk... until I see the two cars parked an inch from both sides of my car. My arms dropped. My ego face vanished. Fuck. WHAT the fuck. What kind of monster would do such a thing? How the hell do I even get in?? Actually, it's a hatchback, so it's pretty simple to get in, so I pop the hatch and fold down the rear seats. But I'm no idiot... somebody's gotta be trying to Youtube this, right? I look out at the condo windows all around me. I spent 10 minutes looking at every single one. Whose shades are slightly open? Did that curtain move? Where's the lens, you bastards!! After my paranoia subsided, I climbed in the back, shut the hatch behind me, and scrambled over the seats as quickly as possible. Surely nobody could have seen me in there crawling all over my newish gem of a vehicle. I fold in the side mirrors, back out and leave. I never did that shit again. Not once. My girlfriend also left me."
funny,"Yes, I saw the driver from a distance get into this car after keying my vehicle."   Followed up by the driver proving they were somewhere else at the time you claimed they keyed your car.   Followed up by the judge asking you to explain how you can see them key your car when they weren't there.   Followed up by getting in trouble for perjuring yourself in court."
funny,"How are they gonna prove they weren't there when they were and they are actually guilty?  If I leave my car parked like that, I'm only going somewhere for a short period (under 30 minutes) so your argument is incorrect.   I said "From a distance" because I would say I was walking back from a distance and didn't realize what they were doing was keying my car until I got close enough.   Also, they will most likely be flustered trying to lie about something they actually did that I am rightfully accusing them of doing.  As far as they know, I actually did see them do it."
funny,"Last night my SO and I went to McDonald's for a late night snack. We were waiting in line, and the drive thru attendant was leaning out the window. My SO mentioned that she knew him from high school, so I engaged him in conversation. We talk for a minute, and out of nowhere he says, "Hey, do you like Monty Python?" I told him that I was a big fan. "Do you want this?" He asked, showing me the DVD in the picture. Turns out someone had randomly given it to him in the drive-thru and he didn't want it. Best snack run ever."

funny,"You do realize that there are a bunch of universities in every state, right?  Naming the first eight you can think of off the top of your head doesn't really prove anything.  Also, private universities don't really factor into a discussion of the quality of a state's publicly funded education, so Duke, Elon, and Wake Forrest are all out. Your best argument here is UNC Chapel Hill, which US News and World Report ranked 5th among public universities (behind Virginia) and 30th overall for 2014 (I realize their methodology has some debatable flaws, but it's a commonly cited ranking and serves as an okay indicator).   Universities, mind you, are tangent to the comment on education at the high school level and lower, with completely different standards of education, hiring practices, etcetera.  Furthermore, many college students attend a school out of state. Therefor, when discussing how well educated any particular state is, unless we look at a census of the population's education, I argue it would be best to look at the state's public K-12 education.   The American Legislative Exchange Council's Report Card on American Education &lt; ranks North Carolina's K-12 education 7th nationally, behind Massachusetts, Vermont, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island (Colorado ranked above NC as well, but you only claimed that NC was one of the best educated sates on the East Coast, so it's beside the point).  Moreover, the NEA's 2013-2014 study of K-12 education statistics &lt; found that NC experienced the highest decrease in average teacher salary, plummeting 15% after inflation, which is a warning sign that the quality of education will drop going forward.   Thus, I argue that, while North Carolina is probably the best educated state in the South, it's not one of the best educated states on the East Coast (unless you broaden that category to include the top 6, which seems too large for the word "best" to act as a descriptor).   Edit:"

I can't find the article I read a couple months ago, but Reynolds has always wanted to do it and they have a script (written by the Zombieland team).

funny,"When I was a kid my parents forced me to play Little League Baseball for some odd reason which I never understood. If they wanted me to go outside and be active then why didn't they ask me "what would you like to do" instead of just forcing me to go out in skin-tight pants and swing a metal stick at a ball that a child with barely developed motor skills is hurling his absolute hardest at me. One of the main forms of protection for this is a plastic shield they give you for your balls, though It would have been preferable to have a real shield for the 16 year old pretending to be 12 to throw his fastest fast ball at me.   One day a rather attractive teenage decided to attend our little league game. She sat in the bleachers between the parents who cared far too much about the outcome of the and the parents who could barely be bothered enough to wear pants. She was wearing a white shirt and during the course of drinking a water bottle she had brought with her was bumped by a passing pedestrian. This caused the water to spill out of the bottle and down the front of her shirt.   Luckily for me I was standing near the fence where this had happened and got a great view of a tan training bra that she had long outgrown. Suddenly my skin tight pants were now tighter then that and my 12 year old self made a discovery. Growing a boner in an unyielding hard plastic cage is an incredibly uncomfortable event which will quickly become painful. Normally the pain would counteract the horniness and cause the boner to end. Except for the fact that the girl was now trying to pat her shirt dry with a nearby towel and was doing so quite unsuccessfully. She was succeding in only causing her breasts to bounce which simply made me horny again.   This was my first encounter with the 'infinite loop'. I tried to leave the field to end it however my coach was so obsessed that we beat the other 12 year olds in this game he screamed at me to stay in place. This made for the most amazing yet dreaded 5 minutes of my life up to that point."
funny,"Well, chap, the issue seems to be in that your verbosity you, at times only, of course, seem to distract from the real (also known as legitimate or, to be precise, succinct) message you are, and have been, attempting to convey. In this endeavour I do encourage, and even strongly encourage you to attempt the social media and microblogging site, Twitter ( although most countries have their own sites, so you may be able to append .ca, .co.uk, .ch, .it, and potentially others as well), as it restricts you to fewer characters (including punctuation and spaces, of course) than other media would allow.   I have found in my experiences and travels that this shortening of your language (and often regardless of language, although the Tululi of the Western Sahara do not have this issue) will lead to a more thorough understanding of the direct message, as many people (regardless of age, colour, creed, and intellect) do not have the comprehension or attention span to fully disseminate ideas, concepts, and arguments if expanded too excessively.

funny,"She was roommates with an acquaintance, who was hell-bent on trying to get out of her lease so she could move into an apartment with her boyfriend. So the roommate started writing notes, sending emails, sending texts to my sister telling her all the things she was annoyed with as far as being roommates go. She was documenting things - she was apparently building a case. My sister did NOT know that.   Then, she wrote in lipstick on the bathroom mirror one morning: "You bitch I know what you did." My sister saw that after waking up and had no idea what she was referring to. So when she went to ask her, the roommate said something like "I know you tried to poison me. I could smell the chemicals on my toothbrush." So she thought my sister was trying to poison her by putting cleaning chemicals on her toothbrush. When my sister asked to see/smell the said toothbrush - she said she "threw it away."   Anyway...this little fight between them continued for a month or so. So they agreed to stop using each other's things - even shared things. Like furniture and kitchen stuff (pots/pans). So my sister came home to find her pans in the sink one day, meaning her roommate had used them (after making a huge deal about not using each other's things). So my sister wrote a note and left it on the kitchen counter that said:   "You probably shouldn't use my pots and pans, like we agreed. Besides, I poison all of my stuff anyway!"   Eventually, the roommate called the cops on my sister, saying her life was endangered, using this note as evidence. The cops showed up to my sister's job and told her that a complaint was being filed against her, that they had the note, etc. Didn't seem like a big deal at the time.   Then, the roommate sued my sister to get out of the lease, under the "threat to her life" clause in their contract. The ONLY evidence she had was the note. That's it. And she won. She got out of the lease, and my sister was stuck paying for the rest of the FULL lease (6-months) PLUS the 3 months before that the roommate had already paid (to the time that the note was written)."

funny,"I had a keyboard just like the one in OP's photo (sans chia) that died. I'd used rubber dome keyboards all my life and decided I wanted to see what mechanical keyboards were all about. I bought a Corsair K95, which comes with the Cherry MX Red keys and it is just awesome. It feels really nice to type with and I like the sound. It's not too loud or too quiet, yet it can be both loud or quiet depending on how you type. The key presses are very light and smooth, and it feels very sturdy and well-made. Of course, it cost over 100 bucks, so it damn well better be good.   I think a lot of folks get into mechanical keyboards because of the different types of keys they offer. Blues, Greens, Browns, Whites, Reds, Blacks, etc and so forth. They all have differences and you can pick what you like. Some folks have them all. I got a little key tester that had the different types of Cherry MX keys and found that reds were what I thought I would like. After getting my K95 I have no regrets. The reds are great. The blues seem nice as well, but they're just too damn loud for me to use with any sort of regularity, so they were a no-go for me."
funny,"Let's pretend, for the moment, that you had dedicated your life to researching and hopefully finding a cure (or even just a more effective treatment) for a given disease. Although it's a noble calling, you still need money to fund your pursuit.   Further suppose that there was an allegedly helpful organization out there with the appearance of being willing to assist you with that financial issue. After all, they market themselves to the public as being concerned with nothing more than finding a cure.   Here's the problem, though: That organization doesn't  want  to find a cure. Their entire business model focuses on "raising awareness" for the disease by way of selling officially licensed merchandise (and blocking anyone else from using it, or even using  the color associated with it ) and holding pointless "walks" that trick people into thinking that they're doing something productive. The organization gives very, very little to actual research... and since their brand name is so ubiquitous,  your  little laboratory doesn't receive any kind of funding, because people keep giving the organization money (rather than the people who might actually put it to good use).   To make matters worse, this organization - when it  does  offer financial assistance - chooses what it wants to support via a set of questionable morals, speculated to be centered around how they can most effectively increase their standing in the public eye."

funny,"Just letting you know that if every transgender person had access to medically perfect cost free no complication procedures then sure what you say might be true. But no, the procedures aren't perfect, are super expensive and often come with major risks.   To not recognize someone as the gender they are because of something you probably can't and won't see is pretty fucked up.   I'm not attacking you in particular but you have a misguided viewpoint which is sadly shared with many people.   Most physical characteristics can be accomplished through a process called HRT. which is pretty cost effective and allows a person to take hormones and suppress their natural ones to take on characterisitics of the preferred gender. But even still access to HRT isn't given to everyone who wants it sadly so in a perfect world everyone would accept everyone for what they want regardless of that even."
funny,"Shit.   I'm an assistant manager in a chain of frozen food stores in the UK. We have a similar policy that urges staff to approach shoplifters in a civilised manner and to never follow them out the store.   One Saturday evening we had 2 blokes fill up a full shopping trolley (cart) with around 拢300 - 拢500 of shopping and slowly made their way to the exit. Luckily, shoplifters in our area have a certain look about them, making them easy to spot. so I'd watched them the whole way round.   They kept a distance of around 20ft from each other at all times and as the first one (very casually) left the store, and was promptly stopped by myself. (Me: "what the fuck do you think you're playing at?" Him:"oh shit, sorry mate, I forgot"). The other bloke noticed and hanged back.   After sending the first would-be shoplifter on his way, the 2nd decided to try his luck, however this time I wasn't feeling so generous. I followed him out the store, took the trolley from his grasp and threw him on the floor, at which point, one of my larger colleagues darted out the store and sat on him till the rozzers arrived.   Yay for justice. Also, still in my job."
funny,"I know this may never be read by anyone, but I do own a banana suit, and for my Church's Vacation Bible School (summer day camp for elementary schoolers) I wore it on disguise day. After a long day of teaching kids motions to a bunch of cheesy songs, a bunch of us went out to grab some Chick-fil-A as is the custom for us Christians. While in line, an obviously mentally challenged girl turned around and lost her shit freaking out and yelling with joy about the "Banana Man" in line behind her. She begged her mom to take her picture with me but her mother said no and to "stop bothering the poor boy". I wasn't the least bit bothered by her as I have lots of experience dealing with MR people, so I gave her a hug and was able to watch her smile from ear to ear as her mom made her sit down and wait for her. It was heartbreaking to see her mom treat her with such little patience (I know that having a child with special needs can be taxing, but it isn't every day your kid gets to see a guy rockin' a banana suit), but also heartwarming to see the smile my dumb outfit was able to bring to her face. I still really wish that I would have made her mom take our picture or that I would have brought out my camera to snap a selfie, but what can ya do?"
funny,"True - If you look at the entire population of working people. The average earning rate of women is about 3/4 the average earning rate of men   False - This is some kind of sexist discriminatory bias oppression [insert more buzzwords]   In a one to one ratio, looking at identical jobs with identical employees, where the  only  difference is one has a penis and the other has a vagina, there is essentially zero difference. Bob the CEO who has a Harvard 1st, works 70hrs a week, has no children and has been employed for five years earns the exact same wage as Jane the CEO who has a Harvard 1st, works 70hrs a week, has no children and has been employed for five years.   The difference comes into account when you look at 'averages' across huge swathes of people (or, better yet to get that juice 77%, across huge swathes of jobs too). Women typically work more flexible hours, less hours, more likely to take maternity leave etc etc etc. All of this adds up to functionally doing less hours, less overtime, etc."
funny,"Maybe I'm giving people too much credit in assuming that they can make their own decisions despite "What the media tells them." You obviously know that a lot can change in ~50 years. My mom graduated high school ~1985 as valedictorian as well, and she went on to be an electrical engineer whose company later paid her to go back to college for business so she could be promoted and eventually go on to become VP of a major power company. I'm not sure what kind of adversity she faced in making this decision, but based on what I know about her childhood it was 90% "get me a high income job so I can get the hell out of this house with 6 siblings". Obviously this is just one case, but based on the fact that my mom was an electrical engineer and my dad was a software designer, and seeing how well off we are as a family, I decided to go into electrical/computer engineering for college. Yet, I still know damn well that I could go be a hairstylist if I so choose.   Based on your mom's age I can assume you're probably 30 something years old, so I can't really blame you for not knowing the dynamics of high school now. I can 100% ensure you that high school, at least for me, went out of its way to tell students that they could be whatever the hell they wanted, boy or girl. In fact they made double sure to encourage women to get into STEM simply based off of the male to female ratio, advising that they would have no trouble getting snatched up by a company looking to diversify their workforce; but they always followed up by saying they could still be a stay-at-home mom or whatever else they wanted to be anyway. Every single student was entirely aware of what society "expected" from them, and that they could do whatever the hell they wanted regardless as long as they knew that it was their own decision and not cultural conditioning.   ANYWAY, now that my entirely anecdotal evidence is out of the way, I'd like to respond to your actual proposed solution by saying this: It's already in the works. Seriously, there is enough awareness and media flak to ensure that most movies and TV shows have women in traditionally male dominated fields, (as well as companies and universities going out of their way to include women as well). The characters running the hospital on  House  are ~50% female,  Mythbusters  has (had?) Kari Byron, the lead in  Gravity  was female, I'm pretty sure one of the leads in  Interstellar  is female, one of the leads in  Prometheus  was female (these are just a few off the top of my head); I'm telling you the influence is everywhere. I honestly think that the only thing we have to do is wait; it took 20 years for our mothers to have different opportunities, and I think that with time these gender ratios in STEM fields will even out. Isn't there some study that women aged 20-25 are making just a little more than men of the same demographic nowadays? The movement to include women in STEM fields is still fairly recent, and it's not like women can just switch careers; we have to wait for the women of tomorrow to graduate first."

They're not supposed to get involved in that fight, same way wizards aren't supposed to use their absurd magical powers to advance the goals of either faction. Saruman not only betrayed everyone and joined up with Sauron, he also helped create a magicked army of super soldiers and bring down the tops of mountains on the fellowship to slow their progression. Look where that landed him? Banned from the faction, killed, and his ex-comrade was sent back to middle-earth promoted to Saruman's old job.

funny,"Then you didnt think analyze the book too much. Its about bilbo developing who he is with the help of his friends. He learns to trust them and they trust him. But thorins greed makes it all about money and warps who he was, though he evolves past this it costs him his life to realize he was too greedy and shouldve listened to bilbo as he would have before they entered the mountain (who at the beginning of the book would have immediately caved and given him the archenstone instead of doing what he thought was right). They developed this concept more and i think they did an okay job of it but the clearly hastily thrown together love triangle just kills time. Just like the white orc bullshit which is really just a cover for having an "important" character kill fili, kili, and thorin rather than them simply dying from their multitude of wounds (which also makes more sense than them being freaking invincible up until one sword thrust). This move also cut out the fili and kili familial devotion to thorin, replacing it with dying for a girl."

funny,"I feel compelled to say this bc I've never seen this argument made, downvotes be damned.   Have you ever tried using an autotuner? You actually have to be pretty close on pitch initially for an auto tuner to correct it onto key without hearing an awful glitch. You have to be even closer to on pitch to add an autotuner and not even perceive that it's been applied.   This is for singing of course. In a nutshell (from a soundwave point of view) the difference between singing and speaking is that singing utilizes single pitches or frequencies, while speaking uses multiple frequencies with no pitch. Which is why you can speak over any song and it sounds "on key"   The way autotune works is that it forces whatever signal it receives into a single pitch, meant for singing. When applying autotune to a multiple frequencies, such as speaking or rapping, the autotune gets confused and the result is the glitchiness that a lot of people (myself included) find annoying."
funny,"I appreciate your respectful discussion as well. And, in many ways, I DO agree with it. I'm really taking a principled stand on the basis that I have a psychology degree, and roomed with an engineering major, a physics major, and an art major. The first two would get to point out all the bullshit that goes on under the umbrella of Psychology as proof that the entire field is unscientific. And Evo Psych was such a huge majority of it.   I have no problem with what Evo Psych does, I have a huge problem with the way a large portion of the field presents their findings. While useful, it is not scientific, and paying lip service to the principles without actually engaging in the necessary procedures undermines the credibility of a field that can and is doing a lot of good in the world.   In my own mind, I'm a huge fan of game theory. It isn't strictly scientific, but I think it helps a lot of people break rather obtuse concepts down into relatable, actionable learning. But if a game theorist were to start talking about some of the more obscure applications of their field (which are often thought experiments) and presenting them as scientific evidence, I would be just as frustrated as I am with Evo Psych in general."
funny,"Back when I first owned my civic I decided to buy an aftermarket intake and filter from Spoon Racing. It looked like an OEM intake but sounded much better.   As I continued into a new job I decided I wouldn't have time for service for my car so I sent it to get a full service as I drove a rental car. I went back the next day and they said I was lucky I came right then and there since my filter was black. They said they had the same type and they could put it in for, 85$.   I looked at the black filter and saw it was different as they went to go change it and they came back and said it was done. I then asked why they would charge me the same price for the filter and no labor. They looked pale as I explained I put a different intake with a smaller filter and it didn't make sense that they were able to change a Japanese filter and my Japanese filter was now white as a base.   They immediately apologized and said the original mechanic who wasn't there probably mixed up the cars issues and that I don't have to pay anything extra.

But when you work at "the happiest place on earth" and you somehow think that the mere fact of being born entitles you to behave however you want because you feel personally justified by the mood that you are in then YOU are the problem."

funny,"Girls are like buses, they are designed to carry passengers and have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker buses and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer distance services. Bus manufacturing is increasingly globalised, with the same design appearing around the world.   Buses may be used for scheduled bus transport, scheduled coach transport, school transport, private hire, tourism; promotional buses may be used for political campaigns and others are privately operated for a wide range of purposes.   Horse drawn buses were used from 1820, followed by steam buses in the 1830 and electric trolleybuses in 1882. The first buses powered by internal combustion engines were used 1895[citation needed] and this is still the most common power source. Recently there has been growing interest in hybrid electric buses, fuel cell buses, electric buses as well as ones powered by compressed natural gas or bio-diesel.  Formats include single-decker bus, double-decker bus and articulated bus (or 'bendy-bus') the prevalence of which varies from country to country. bi-articulated buses are also manufactured, and passenger-carrying trailers鈥?either towed behind a conventional bus (a bus trailer), or hauled as a trailer by a truck (a trailer bus). Smaller midibus have a lower capacity and open-top bus are typically used for leisure purposes. In many new fleets, particularly in local transit systems, there is an increasing shift to low-floor buses primarily for easier accessibility. Coaches are designed for longer-distance travel and are typically fitted with individual high-backed reclining seats, seat-belts, toilets, audio-visual entertainment systems and can operate at higher speeds with more capacity for luggage. Coaches may be single- or double-deckers, articulated and often include a separate luggage compartment under the passenger floor. Guided buses are fitted with technology to allow them to run in designated guideways, allowing the controlled alignment at bus stops and less space taken up by guided lanes than conventional roads or bus lanes.   Bus manufacturing may be by a single company (an integral manufacturer), or by one manufacturer's building a bus body over a chassis produced by another manufacturer. Early bus manufacturing grew out of carriage coachbuilding, and later out of automobile or truck manufacturers. Early buses were merely a bus body fitted to a truck chassis. This body+chassis approach has continued with modern specialist manufacturers, although there also exist integral designs such as the Leyland National where the two are practically inseparable. Specialist builders also exist and concentrate on building buses for special uses, or modifying standard buses into specialised products.   Integral designs have the advantages that they are have been well tested for strength, stability and so forth, and also are off-the-shelf. But there are, however, two incentives to use the chassis+body model. First it allows the buyer and manufacturer both to shop for the best deal for their needs, rather than having to settle on one fixed design鈥?the buyer can choose the body and the chassis separately. Second it is likely that over the lifetime of a vehicle (in constant service and heavy traffic) that it will get minor damage now and again, and to be able easily to replace a body panel or window etc. can vastly increase its service life and save the cost and inconvenience of removing it from service.[citation needed]   As with the rest of the automotive industry, into the 20th century bus manufacturing increasingly became globalized, with manufacturers producing buses far from their intended market to exploit labour and material cost advantages. As with the cars, new models are often exhibited by manufacturers at prestigious industry shows to gain new orders. Due to the costs involved in owning, operating and driving buses and coaches, many bus and coach uses a private hire of vehicles from charter bus companies, either for a day or two, or a longer contract basis, where the charter company provides the vehicles and qualified drivers. Charter bus operators may be completely independent businesses, or charter hire may be a subsidiary business of a public transport operator who might maintain a separate fleet or use surplus buses, coaches, and dual purpose coach seated buses. Many private taxicab companies also operate larger minibus vehicles to cater for group fares. Companies, private groups and social clubs may hire buses or coaches as a cost effective method of transporting a group to an event or site, such as a group meeting, racing event, or organised recreational activity such as a summer camp. Entertainment or event companies may also hire temporary shuttles buses for transport at events such as festivals or conferences. Party buses are used by companies in a similar manner to limousine hire, for luxury private transport to social events or as a touring experience. Sleeper buses are used by bands or other organisations that tour between entertainment venues and require mobile rest and recreation facilities. Some couples hire preserved buses for their wedding transport instead of the traditional car. Buses are often hired for parades or processions. Victory parades are often held for triumphant sports teams, who often tour their home town or city in an open-top bus. Sports teams may also contract out their transport to a team bus, for travel to away games, to a competition or to a final event. These buses are often specially decorated in a livery matching the team colours. Private companies often contract out private shuttle bus services, for transport of their customers or patrons, such as hotels, amusement parks, university campuses or private airport transfer services. This shuttle usage can be as transport between locations, or to and from parking lots. High specification luxury coaches are often chartered by companies for executive or VIP transport. Charter buses may also be used in Tourism and for promotion."

funny,"It was thrown off along with a couple other already dead siblings as well as a sister that only made it halfway to shore and a kennel (unsure if they were thrown out in the kennel and the kennel broke apart in the water or if it was just evidence disposal) which were found floating an average of a mile off shore, slightly spread about a point about a mile out. So exact figure is unknown, but people sadly did this quite often and they usually threw them out at this place often as it wasn't in view of any public beaches.

funny,"Oh god, i have to explain my explanation???   Okay, let's try it like this. Let's say you have a box like this (imagine it's a 3d box and there's depth to it equal to the length/height as per a normal box):   XX  XX   The height is "perceived sound level", which is to say: how loud you think it is. Now, in order to increase the level do you want to add to the height directly or to the volume of the box? That's right, you want to add to the height directly--ie, use a logarithmic scale like dB. But what if you're ignorant, like computer programmers who write linear sound level sliders? Then you'll set it up so you add to the box's "volume". In that case, our 2x2x2 "box" would be a "volume 8" (2 cubed). What if you want to go up to "sound level 3", like so?   XXX  XXX  XXX   Then if you're using a logarithmic scale you go +1.   If you're using a volume scale? You have to go up to 27, or +19. If you want to go to 4?   XXXX  XXXX  XXXX  XXXX   Either you need to go to 4 (+1 more), or (with the bad way) to 64 (+37). Notice how that's actually a bigger increase last time for the same "perceived" difference?   If you want to go all the way  up to 11  or +1267 (with the "bad" method).   So, now imagine you have two sliders: one slider is logarithmic and goes from 0-10, the other is linear and goes from 0-1000. At those lower values, the "linear" slider's scale is too high to correctly adjust them--you're dealing with the bottom 10% of the scale. At a "5" rating on logarithmic (about 50% loudness on the 0-10 scale) you'd be at 125 on the linear scale--almost at the bottom. The top 50% only covers the loudness levels from (around) 8-10 on the logarithmic slider.   (Edit)   The reason this "makes sense" to me is because sound is something that happens in 3d, physical space. Which is to say, when you add power to whatever is making the sound it has to fill up that space--fill the volume. But you're not hearing all the sound throughout the entire physical space, you're just hearing it at one point."

If you chose to call yourself an "uneducated, unlicensed, uninsured doctor" you could maybe get away with it legally, but I doubt it.  Photography, like cooking, gardening, and other "productive" hobbies result in an easily presentable body of work (photos, food), and don't carry a high risk of the participants dying. I can't think of one time someone trying to paint something directly caused the unintentional death of the subject, you know?"
funny,"They're all still subjective. Using what you would consider inferior bokeh or exposure, or an unusual focal point in a picture can be done to express the photographer's vision of the subject. These things can be done to great effect sometimes, so saying, for example, that all pictures with a harsh bokeh are objectively inferior to pictures with a creamy bokeh is not true beyond any technical context. Even in a technical context, it's missing the point to assert that all pictures should adhere to any arbitrary standard to be considered "good". They're good if they portray the subject and the photographer's vision of the subject in a clear or evocative way."
funny,"I had another comment somewhere in this thread, but to give you some perspective, I found the original hilarious. I started managing a studio and doing professional portraits for money at 17. This career choice was inspired by a high school photography class.   However, other people took that class. Three years in a row. And invested hundreds in cameras. And never got better at photography. Which is still wonderful, I like seeing people enjoy the art, BUT the problem is, they all  think they're good . People ask me constantly what my opinion is of their work, and I sort of want to say "well, it's just as bad as it was 4 years ago, only it's less grainy now that you've got that $500 camera. How have you not learned proper exposures yet? Crooked does not equal abstract. AND STOP SEPIA TONING EVERYTHING!", but I can't."

mildlyinteresting,"There are many ways to roast a bean.  The stage that you are talking about - that is, a few seconds before the "shiny" phase - is called Full City.  The roast is taken into what is called the second crack, which is the second chemical reaction that happens in a roast.   The first chemical reaction that happens in coffee is called the first crack.  Once the first crack happens, the beans become consumable.  Depending on the bean, anytime between or during these two reactions, can produce an amazing-tasting coffee.  The "shiny" phase that you are speaking of is called a Vienna or French roast.  Some roasters would consider this roasted too much, but coffee is about personal preference, as much as it is about what people say is "right" or "wrong.""
mildlyinteresting,"That's why we need good teachers. Unfortunately, in the U.S, the teaching profession is just not attractive to smart, young  people. I have a license to teach and the draw is just gone. The pay is terrible, but it always has been; but now the job security and related benefits are not there anymore. It's ridiculously tough to get tenure and it's getting even worse and all the juicy retirement benefits teachers have been getting forever are being taken away. So there's that, which actually for some people wouldn't deter them because they get to teach a subject they love. Except now with No Child Left Behind everyone has to teach to the test so there's really not even any joy in it anymore. Full time positions are also extremely hard to find now, so you're likely to be subbing in a horrible school with no budget for supplies--oh, there's another thing, teachers often have to pay out of their pockets for supplies. It's just not attractive anymore at all. And don't go with the "summers off, short days, lots of vacation" stuff. For one, teachers actually get a 10-month salary that is spread over 12 months (hence the horrible pay.) They do not have short days as after school time is spent grading and creating lessons--we're talking about the good teachers here--which actually gives them a much longer day than most people. Same thing holds true for all those vacation days. I'm not trying to whine and say how terrible things are for teachers--the people there already have the security in tenure and better pay and better assignments; the problem is there no draw for new people to become teachers, so the quality will decline."

Trove,"I understand that and I completely agree. Although that is only nice when there are as many players as we have now. Think about trying to sell an item when 100,000 people are all chatting at the same time? What if the game get 1,000,000 players? Global chat would scroll so fast that no one would ever even see your message about trying to buy or sell something. Even if they added a trade channel. So I also like the human interaction, but in a situation like that, it makes it nearly impossible to sell things. Also think of this. You want to buy yourself a new shadow item because you want to start farming for blocks so you can build an epic cornerstone. So you look for an item that is a shadow hat that has forge level 25 with Health, Lasermancy(2 astrex), and movement speed(2 astrex). There is one item in the AH that someone is trying to sell for 50,000 flux (which you find to be a little outrageous). So you try another search for the same item at forge level 20 that is only 10,000 flux. So you decide to buy it because you feel you can just upgrade it yourself for 600 flux. Now you have an awesome hat for mining and someone else was actually able to sell there item without having to scroll chat by describing the stats in a long message that is just going to be scrolled off chat by another persons lengthy message trying to do the same."
Trove,"If you really like community aspects of mmos, you'll probably like it. There's not much to the rpg part of the game yet, it's a basic 'get to a higher level so you can get loot so you can get to a higher level so you can do raids so you can get better loot' The actual loot is pretty cool though, since the majority of it is community designed and often referential to other media. That said, There are only three weapon types and only two 'armor' types so if you do multiple playthroughs, you'll probably end up with alot of repeats. There are also other rare aesthetic items you can go for, with very low drop chances so if that's your thing then that'll be fun. Adventureing is fun for the first character playthrough I find, but after that you'll have seen every dungeon in every biome and every boss and every enemy. The constantly randomly generated worlds do remedy this, but there's only so much you can do with a random generator before the novelty wears thin and you stop exploring and just look for dungeons, pausing to mine ore occasionally. Combat is pretty fun, there are five vastly different classes right now (but expect to have to grind in-game or pay up front for a couple of them), and they're each fun to play. It does add a replay value to the game if you want to go through all the worlds again. It can eventually get repetitive if you only use one class, as there are only 4 abilities each and no special weapon or armor effects like in other rpgs such as elemental effects. The most you'll be doing is comparing red and green stat values, where one item will be objectively worse and one objectively better, not really any trade-offs here. I do believe that the community aspect is the games strongest point so far, as it is simple, uncomplicated fun to play with a bunch of people. This is where I think the simplicity is advantageous over other mmos, as it can be enjoyed by anyone without any learning curve or large gap separating the new players and veterans; everyone just has a good time. Seeing how different classes synergize or the creativity of a group working together is the most fun I've had so far. If you don't really like groups, trying to go solo will definitely get boring fast. You have only a small plot of land that is all yours to customize (but seeing what people can do with it is pretty cool) that you can bring with you to wherever you travel to. But besides showing it off, you'll only use it as a portable refuel/storage station. These are of course only my opinions, even if I was trying to be objective, so watch video of the game and listen to others before deciding. And of course, it's in beta and incomplete, so you could wait for the full game before making a purchase decision."

She turned  and quickly did the same to Kayle.   Else in shock began sending flurries of snow and ice towards Mera, disorienting her and the rest of Team Bombzoid. An icicle hit Rohan in the head. Mera was trying to send back flurries of water, but it would freeze the second it left her hands. The ice began riding up her arms, and when she would focus on vibrating the molecules to warm up, Elsa would feel the shift in pressure and send larger flurries of ice.  Mera was frozen in position, and slowly working on breaking it.   鈥淲hat the hell did we get ourselves in to?鈥?Hellboy thought to himself as Rohans spell lifted. He retreated through the doorway behind them.   Elsa and storm began pushing through the crowd while scanning it to make sure nobody was badly hurt, and made their way outside.

Megaman blasted at Hellboys feet, freeing him of his ice shackles, and began running at Elsa.   Else began piling snow on top of Megaman. He was agile and capable of jumping out of it, but it was enough to distract him from what she was doing.   鈥淵ou think you can beat me?!

Storm barely dodged it with a swift launch up, but was quickly grabbed and violently thrown to the ground by Megaman.   BLAST   Another shot hit her. This time It was Point Blank.   When the Smoke cleared, there wasn鈥檛 much left. Giant Megaman stared into the bloody, dusty crater in anger.

england,"No you don't understand - it works one of two ways;   1) Either you are resident in the UK, in which case even if you require care in Sweden the costs  will be billed  to the UK - and by extension the taxpayer.   2) OR you are technically resident in Sweden, in which case you don't need a UK-endorsed EU healthcard and can apply for one directly in Sweden, although you may need your British passport to prove you are an EU citizen.

Can you understand that there is NO SUCH THING as an isolated, truly "independent" being on this world or on any other in this infinite Universe? Every living thing is your brother or sister. KNOW NOW, right now, that this is not some recycled hippie New Age John Lennon "kumbaya" bullshit I'm trying to sell you. That's how you are denied this truth in your crazy world - it is lumped into those tired old dismissive categories and swept out of your sight, never to trouble you again. But nonetheless, it remains true that not even GOD HIMSELF can alter the fact that unity and interconnection is the ACTUAL TRUTH of all existence. It's a fact, a complete, stone cold concrete FACT, and the only fact that matters."   "Most importantly , you are angry because you live in a world that is killing, enslaving, and destroying itself in a state of total self-satisfied, smug arrogance, and by God (or Darwin), you've had it up to here. You aren't just a little miffed or vaguely disappointed at the sorry shape the human race is in. That's for people who don't care much, and don't intend to let such small stirrings of conscience disrupt their TV time. No, that route is not open to you anymore."   "If you have allowed love  and compassion to take firm root in your heart, do not be surprised or dismayed that you are quite capable of becoming enraged, livid, and furious at the insanity of it all. This does not mean you are a "spiritual failure" as the phony, self-seeking "gurus" of the world would have you believe. It means precisely the opposite. You have the capacity for great anger because you have the capacity for great compassion. They are co-identical, like the Taoist concepts of yin and yang, and neither occurs without implying the co-existence of the other.  Thousands of children are starving to death every day, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with the fact that you may begin to feel absolutely outraged over it. On the contrary - what's so horribly wrong with the world is that everyone else doesn't. "   "If you dare, decide right now  to be "in the world but not of it." Yeah, I know Jesus and some other scary religious people said this, but I can't help that. They said it because they had to. There's no other way to give you any chance of becoming sane. "I am the way, the truth, and the life" doesn't mean that I personally (as in the author of this webpage) am some special awesome being you have to obey and listen to just because I'm The Lord of Lords, Captain America, or even Rick James. Hell no, and please get that crazy rubbish out of your head. Instead, it simply means that this message (the message of compassion) is the only way to actual sanity and a better world - and it meant exactly the same thing when Jesus said it, too. "I, the message of compassion, am the way, the truth, and the life." Sorry about your bad luck, but no man comes to the Father (your true nature) but through me (the message of compassion). Got it now? Okay, good - and don't blame me, meaning "me" as in the imperfect human being who is being used as a vehicle for these truths. I didn't make the rules, and neither did Jesus, Buddha, the Dalai Lama, or anybody else who has tried to carry the message to you."   "Aim high and never take "no" for an answer.  Don't let anyone tell you you're setting your sights too high. Man's reach must always exceed his grasp or we're all wasting our time doing absolutely nothing. Don't be fooled by those who tell you to "be practical." They only want to kill their consciences by excusing and rationalizing away their own unwillingness to act. Dream big. Resolve to save the whole suffering world and get busy doing it. By doing that, you'll already have succeeded. As Gandhi put it, BE the change. That's all - nothing less, nothing more.""
Warframe,"Why would you want to spend resources on the "obsolete" frames? It's the same reason why people still buy the older versions of smartphones even though there are much more improved versions available.   -They're cheaper! We know where to get them, their blueprints and costs are set, and every skill, power, and stat has been analyzed and is available to you. All you have to do is choose what you want, get the blueprints, and by then you should have the materials necessary to craft it! If you save up for the Primes, you may be waiting quite a while.   -They're effective! Excalibur Prime has what, one extra polarity slot and a higher base shield regen. It's an improvement but it's not an upgrade that so desperately leaves the base Excalibur wanting. The powers, speed, handling, and numbered stats are exactly identical. And mods give bigger bonuses to these statistics than the Prime frames would."
Warframe,"Nekros is going to be one of those hate it or love it frames. Even though I am in between about him, I don't think anything really needs to change. He adds an interesting approach to Warframe. He's not another damage frame, but a unique utility frame. That being said, I disagree with mostly everything you have said.   Soul Punch:  For 25 energy, this offers a plenty useful utility. Examples: Toxic on the pod? Punch. Knock down Heavy Grineer before they knock you down. Punch. It offers single target damage, yes, but it also adds a ranged "get the fuck away" utility, and I mean really far away. I do agree with you that the animation of the punch could be improved.   Terrify  offers utility when your squad or the pod are becoming overwhelmed. I feel it's just a little short of 75 energy worthy and has a similar purpose as Shadows of the Dead, so some sort of small debuff should be added.   Desecrate  is Nekros' main skill. This is what makes him unique amongst all the frames. I am certain you have not used this ability to its full potential, otherwise you'd be satisfied with it. Let's just say, with certain setups, Nekros can be the difference between acquiring 20+ mutagens in 20 waves of Derelict defense or 40-50+ mutagens. The ability pays for itself with the energy orbs acquired from bodies, plus some. The more bodies, the more loot. Put on carrier and spam. The energy comes to you.   Shadows of the Dead:  This is not a damage ult, this is crowd control. It's your enemies' mind fuck. Hell, even I am confused. That is my only beef with the ability; how difficult it can be to tell the enemies apart from the allies amidst the chaos, and speaking of chaos, when paired with Nyx's ability, you have their brains scrambling. Your team is mostly safe."
Warframe,"true not 100% is random but most are. very rarely do they really control them. Also im in the time zone where DE is based on as a main time and i still will see great stuff when i sleep. there's no pleasing everyone. And the ones they do control are potatoes, but occasionally they will take something into their hands. For example the last dev stream gave a glaive for Melee 2.0 but besides that there have been other cases where they have to do something but honestly i can only think of 1 other time. when vauban alerts where messed up and that was months ago."
Warframe,"Volt: VERY strong, but his utility drops off in the endgame. A great choice for beginners. I'd start with him. The main problem with him in endgame is a problem that the devs have been working to address: in high-level content, it's just not possible to get pure damage abilities to compete with guns at all (and Volt's most-used abilities are damage-based). That said, his powers do still have decent utility because you can stun large groups of enemies and you have Electric Shield which increases your weapon damage while providing cover for your allies. So if you want to support your allies, Volt could be a good, if unconventional, choice. Also, just a personal thing: try not to use Speed too much. Some people like it, but I find it REALLY annoying when the team's Volt suddenly decides we all have to run as fast as possible.   Saryn: Personally, I'm not a fan, and I don't think she'd really be a good choice for beginners. Plus I've never seen a single Saryn in endgame content so that should tell you something. I find her first ability mostly pointless. Her second does not mesh well with her playstyle. Her third is just mediocre. Her fourth is decent but there are better ones the whole game through. Saryn is most definitely not a support frame.   Frost: A decently strong choice for the whole game. Not the easiest for a new player, I wouldn't think, but certainly a solid choice. Frost is DEFINITELY a support frame with his main power being snow globe, a sphere that you and your allies can shoot out of but enemies can't shoot into.   Vauban: Situationally one of the best Warframes. Outside of Defense and Infested Survival, he dies a lot and isn't particularly great. Not a good choice for a new player, even in the off chance that you could get his parts in a timely manner, I'd suggest someone else for now. He also really wants some higher level mods to work well."
Warframe,"The Latron Wraith is a more damage per second based weapon than damage per shot as the Prime is. It's got a lot less puncture, but it compensates (arguably more than compensates, some calculations put it at higher DPS than the Latron Prime)  by having a significant buff to both firerate and crit chance and a recoil reduction, meaning it behaves less like a light sniper rifle, more like a heavy assault rifle that can also snipe. I just bind the scroll wheel as a secondary fire button and use that to get its full firerate as the scroll wheel sends signals a lot faster than the mouse button."
Warframe,"Let's just number your 4 requirements in order, as 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the ease of my post.  For the sake of this comment, I am taking into account all discussion that was previously done concerning actual critiques and alternatives.  I am also considering whatever new changes I've added, as the problem with Cauterize was made evident, and I decided I didn't like Meditate in the least.   &nbsp;   Ember:     1) Ember uses Accelerant quite effectively to stop incoming damage, with the glass-cannon goal of killing all enemies prior to being killed herself   2) Ignoring enemy CC is easy on any frame by simply using an animation-based power.  Any frame can do it, and if you can't, I guess its time you practice.   3) My reworks for WoF damage, Rising Phoenix's extra damage, and the energy cost drop of Fire Blast allows for decent later-game damage that can stack quite well when combined together   4) Too many frames repeat powers.  Most of my ideas are designed to step a bit away from that.  Also, this was a two-part question you made.  Yes, this is helpful to the group, since Rising Phoenix aids in revives, AND has a chance of keeping Ember alive on what would normally be death.     &nbsp;   Excalibur:     1) Slash Dash has front facing damage immunity.  Ward cuts down 45% of all damage at the cost of stamina, functioning as an alternative parry with 360 degrees.   2) Once again, learn to animation dodge.  If not, use the power strength version of Radial Blind to keep nearby enemies from messing with you   3) It is Excalibur.  The sword?  No.  It has never given gun bonuses, and frankly, I've never needed them even past an hour of survival... but since you brought it up, 4x melee damage isn't too bad.  Gotta love RB.   4) RB was stolen by Mirage, so in that case, nope.  Ward is unique, so there's that.  Slash Dash, as I designed it, is amazing mobility, and can be chained, making it very unique.     &nbsp;   Saryn:     1) Molt.  It is already a skill.  If you find it doesn't help enough or needs more health, maybe you need to be more tactful in how you use it.   2) Animation dodge... again.   3) As discussed on the thread, Contagion, even with the radius percent bonus, should give a toxin damage modifier.  Besides that... why are you so set on gun DPS bonuses?  The damage is high enough as is, and we don't need it.  200k red crit head-shots using a dread is proof enough of that.  Get with the program.  DE is trying to actively moderate ridiculous weapon damage these days.   4) Power-based Reach for huge melee range... Molt to be used as a melee short-fuse bomb, while pulling aggro...      &nbsp;   At the end of the day, all of these ideas are still being worked on, thanks to the great critiques and suggestions of others.  Currently, Saryn needs the most work.  As for similar skills, I try to keep my ideas somewhat original, but even then, most classes in many games are capable of similar skills even if they do it less efficiently than others.  A great example is how Paladins in most games can heal, but not as well as Priests or Clerics.  Such differences in their style and quality of two similar skills is what sets them apart.  If you have anything positive to add in the progression of these ideas, I'd appreciate your input.  If not, feel free to take this imaginary [gold star](   &nbsp;"
Warframe,"Mag is awesome in endgame missions. Just make sure it's a mission the enemies have shields- aka Corpus and Void. (Void being the important one.) See that shield osprey? It's now your best friend.   I routinely end up as top dps and beat all other frames (yes even Nova) in Void missions using Mag. I believe Mag gets a bad rap because new players use Mag with all 4 of her abilities slotted. That's a bad idea. Bullet Attractor is only good on certain bosses so only slot it on Assassination missions. Crush is meh. For the same energy and about the same total casting time you can use Pull four times in a row. Four Pulls is more versatile and doesn't leave you standing around in one spot forever like Crush.   Late wave T4 Def etc you need to think of her abilities not as damage but as utility. Shield Polarize keeps your team's shields and the objective topped up while removing enemy buffs (shield ospreys.) And Pull is CC while you shoot them in the head."
Warframe,"Quoting Rebecca:   >There will be more than 15 Fomorians as far as I know.   >Also, about the 'point multiplier':   >"- Fomorian missions with a higher level of difficulty will provide extra points. Leaderboards are available for players that want to compete for the best score during Fomorian Sabotage Missions. Your individual score is determined by the amount of damage dealt to the Fomorian Power Core during a single run. The highest scores can only be achieved by squads with coordinated deployment of Fomorian Disruptors, and efficient attacks on the Power Cores"   >There are two schools of points:   >Battle Points (1 per Fomorian) >Score points (Clan Leaderboard metric).   > The only thing being multiplied as per difficulty are the Score points for Clan Leaderboards.   >Sorry for any confusions this caused - definitely need to be careful about how the scoring is laid out but I hope this clears up some of the issue."
Warframe,"Personally, I love him. He is SUPER fun to play. I love all of his powers, and unlike almost every other Warframe, I actually USE all of them.   That said, he doesn't do well enough at much of anything to be of much use past mid-game (and you really need to be close to end-game to get him without platinum). His power damage is mediocre, he has decent CC but he's WAY outclassed there. He can SORT OF tank but not really as well as he needs to in order to actually be a tank. Curative Undertow means that the target of your healing needs to stand still to be healed, which can actually get them killed in some situations. He's kind of a jack-of-all-trades, but, as the saying goes, that makes him a master of none. That's all fine and dandy for Exterminates or low-mid level missions, but for T3/T4 (especially the endless missions), you really need to be a master of whatever you're doing in order to be effective."
Warframe,"It depends on what you like. There are stealth themed Warframes, assassin themes, magnets, fire, water, ice, antimatter, void (whatever the hell that dimension jumping lunatic is based on), psychic,  and a host of others that I can't think of.   For  most  of the game, you can play as you like, whichever suits your fancy, and whichever gameplay style you choose would suffice for most applications."
Warframe,"preys upon human tendencies" as a problem, because that is essentially an immensely biased way of putting a negative spin on anything. There has hardly been a single successful video game in history that doesn't exploit human psychology.   Whilst that may be true, I just can't dismiss that people prey upon human psychology is a good thing. Is there some sort of balance that other person believe in? Eg. Oh, you can exploit people's greed but not their laziness? Where's the line to be drawn?   &nbsp;   I wasn't really referring to anything in particular about the Frost thing, yes it is an issue - but I was going to put a small warning on it. If you do such a thing, please just put out what your going to do. People like security and stability, not things in limbo and uncertainty. Not just: Oh, it will open soon鈩?   Power Creep: Again, it was just a reminder. Once I have written up this part I shall give multiple solutions that I have thought of. Of course, mine may/may not be viable, correct or otherwise and people shall either side with me, point out flaws or dismiss it all together - and that's fine, I'm not saying I'm the pinnacle and have the best ideas. I am hella flawed and this is certainly one of the biggest and possibly hardest problem to fix in Warframe. It will not be easy.   No, you are not coming off as a fanboy, defending is good, this is how solutions come to pass, I have flaws in my thinking - other people calling them out can fix them. This list has been in the making for a while, and only somewhat accelerated because of the Vaults being so shrouded in 'mystery' and the AFK detection system. I wish these vaults not to be a negative thing, so I am rushing to hopefully change things they have possibly considered.   I feel in gaming as well as politics, once law or changes have been made, they are quite hard to change or reverse, as we have seen with Viver. The community backlash was IMMENSE and had to be for a simple change."
Warframe,"Like the others and more will say, weapons slots and Warframe slots so you can have a bunch of different weapons and Warframes to pick from.   EVERYTHING (well 99% of everything) can be farmed in game. The exception being some event weapons and the Founder's exclusives (Excalibur Prime, Skana Prime, Lato Prime). Don't pay platinum to buy a weapon in the games market. If you want to pay platinum to other players for Prime Parts that is fine, but you should be able to farm them yourself."
css,"ok im going through the same thing right now, although you have passed me in my CSS studies.  The next thing you're going to want to learn is PHP, you need to have a good understanding of CSS to do that, so you are on your way...

css,"PROBLEM:  CSS doesn't have variables or programming constructs, this can result in a lot of repetition ( very  simple example):   body { color: #FF9A77; padding: 20px; }   div { color: white; background-color: #FF9A77; padding: 20px; }   CSS Preprocessors basically "add" variables as well as functional constructs to CSS so that you can do something like this (using the syntax for my own CjsSS.js / ngCss simply because I do not know LESS, Sass or Stylus):   &lt;script&gt;var sMainColor = '#FF9A77', sDefaultPadding = '20px';&lt;/script&gt;   body { color: /*{{sMainColor}}*/; padding: /*{{sDefaultPadding}}*/; }   div { color: white; background-color: /*{{sMainColor}}*/; padding: /*{{sDefaultPadding}}*/; }   This adulterated CSS code is ultimately outputted to the browser looking like the first example above.

Yogscast,"It was probably pulled due to the song, if not by YouTube then by them once they found more eyeballs on their channel and the possibility of 3 strikes and you are out it's best to not have videos knocking around where songs are played in the background or in this ones case, no in game audio at all.   I cant say for pre SOI as I haven't watched as many as I probably should have (to get some references posted here or throwback comments in videos) but other YT LP'ers used to have whatever was in their mp3 player of choice whilst gaming, back then it seemed harmless, the songs were not rippable unless you liked Eminem or Linkin Park remixed with CoD SFX and gamer commentary.   But YT have DMCA'd a baby dancing to Prince on the radio within the last year, an old song eg 1999, and it wasn't for the duration of the song, so you cant say "Oh we are loosing out on sales and VEVO play counts due to this video" because A> it's a short video, B> there is a baby giggling, C> the parents are talking over it laughing at the baby dancing D> even if they were not talking, the phone mic was shitty.   The baby could have been dancing to any song, it just so happens the rights owners of prince's back catalogue seem to be a bit too iron fisted with any un licenced 'performance', other legal teams might have let it slide, hell prince himself might have thought it was cool, but he doesn't own the rights to his recordings, (hardly any bands do) so his opinion is trumped by the Record label and their legal team.   Yet it still got nuked, because "Fuck you that's why" and the DMCA."
Yogscast,"Well, that's not exactly what he said. The context of Smiffy's rant was that it is pretty annoying to have someone (admittedly, a pretty successful actor) who failed at one super hero role given a second opportunity to play another superhero; and I totally agree.   Ross went on to give a perfect example of a successful franchise (Game of Thrones) giving opportunities to relatively unknown actors and still becoming very successful. There is an abundance of talent available to choose from that a franchise that is expected to be successful should not limit themselves to blockbuster actors/actresses.   Marvel and DC already have a built-in fan base. The audience will come just to see the movie. There is more of a risk by casting a high profile star in a main role and alienating a huge percentage of the prospective audience who disagree with the decision because of said actor/actress previous performances. The risk is far less when casting an unknown, but admittedly well talented, person for the same role."
arma,"You just got the DLC partially for free.   You can join servers with karts (or heli's or whatever in the future), rather than being unable to play those missions at all. You see those assets in full fidelity, and can be a passenger in them.   The ads only show up when you are using content you don't own, such as trying to enter this kart, or the helicoptor, not at any other time. If you are just playing the game, you just play the game, but if you come into contact with DLC you didn't pay for, it reminds you to pay for it, if you use it.   The main menu shows the icon for content you haven't purchased in a different place to content you have purchased, it's not overbearing at all."
arma,"Well, the problem here is that the camera is not automatically compensating for that offset like one would expect from an advanced digital sight system which can otherwise take every other environmental parameter into account.   BIS either don't care enough to implement such compensation, or are not aware of it, which wouldn't be surprising.   Hell, modern tanks even have a special sensor that allows to compensate for "barrel bend" (when the end of the muzzle is slightly misaligned from the turret body):"
arma,"That is because the camera you're looking through is a little bit to the side of the actual barrel.   Example from the 3 main tanks:   Closer look at Kuma:   As you can see, the cameras on all tanks are to the side of the barrel so the barrel is slightly to the left. You have to compensate that when aiming."
NEPA,"Ok, so decided to comment because you really should learn the basics of gun ownership first prior to firing away at the range.  Basic gun safety is incredibly simple and absolutely crucial so that you can enjoy these great sports while keeping yourself/others safe.  I've owned firearms all of my life, and target/trap shooting has created some of the my best memories with my family and friends.  There's nothing quite like heading out to the range with your father, talking for hours, and blowing up coke cans.  I go target or trap shooting once or twice a week, and I wouldn't give up the hobby for anything.   So - on to safety.  Look for a NRA Basics rifle course.  Regardless of your opinion of the NRA, their basic rifle course (or pistol course if that's what you're going for) covers the basics and is sufficient to teach you enough to be safe.  Check out WhiteTail Preserve ( or  Dynamic Force Institute ( or ask at your local gun shop where they know of a NRA-certified instructor.  These guys will help you (1) learn the basics and (2) pick out a first rifle for your needs.   I've actually sat in on a course from Dynamic Force, and the guy's fantastic.  He's a bit heavy on the home defense (and anti gun grabber) stuff, but you'll walk away with a comprehensive knowledge of gun safety.   I recommend that you take the course first, since that will likely alleviate any nervousness about firearm ownership.  As long as you handle the rifle safely and ensure that it's kept somewhere safe (just buy a locked case), you're in for a lifetime of good times.   Next off, I'm less familiar with WB gun shops, but you can't do any better than Bob's Sporting Goods in Hazleton or Dave's Gun Shop in Drums.  The gentlemen that work in those shops will help you/spend as long as you need to walk through every option.  I've spoken to them for hours about various purchases.  Just great family owned businesses. When certain ammo types get hard to find, Bob's usually can find some.   Now for some recommendations of firearm:  For your first gun, I recommend a Ruger 10/22 or a Marlin XT bolt action .22.  I own both/have owned the 10/22 for a long time (It was a present from my mother!).  It still accompanies me to the range every week.  The rifle's incredibly fun to shoot, the ammo's inexpensive (though hard to find recently - just order some online), and it's easy to clean (once you get the hang of it).  If you treat a 10/22 right, it'll last for several lifetimes.  They're also relatively inexpensive firearms for what you get.  The Marlin's a good rifle too, but it's hard to compete with the 10/22 as a first rifle.  I also recommend that you don't slap a scope on right away.  Learn how to use iron sights, then go ahead and use your fancy red dot or whatever.  You should learn iron sights, since it's a bit of a classic skill that is often skipped by new shooters as they try to increase accuracy without getting experience first. Also, don't go off and buy an AR or some tacticool thing as your first rifle.  Learn first, then expand your collection.   Notice that I've been saying "rifle" a lot more than I say "pistol".  That's because my personal philosophy is that a long rifle is a better beginner firearm than a pistol.  I may be wrong, but that's how I've always operated.  Long guns are great for  learning the basics/how to use iron sights.   Cheers! I hope that this helps you get into a sport that I've enjoyed my whole life."

bipolar,"I dropped out of highschool and had thought of becoming a bum and traveling the world. Shortly there after I got a G.E.D., went to community college, and now going to a 4-year school for a bachelor's in math.   I'm not saying it won't be a struggle. When those local maximum points of depression hit, life was hard enough trying to beat my heart and breathe let alone do homework and study."
bipolar,"I can vouch for this insanity.   My wife takes some meds, 1000 mg twice per day. The 1000mg pills cost >$60. We got her doctor to prescribe 2x500mg twice per day instead, < 2$.   That's with insurance but the pharmacy prints what the cost would have been with no insurance, and there is a similarly large price difference."
bipolar,"Thanks. I've been on Lexapro for a cpl years now. The reason why is kind of a case study in the shittiness of the US insurance system: at first I had to go to free clinics (where as you probably know are the WORST places for psychiatric treatment) and then when I finally got added back onto my parents' insurance, there was really only one psychiatrist in my area, and he is of a older generation that sniffs out perceived "pill chasers."   Needless to say, since the Lexapro seemed to be managing my debilitating depression, this new psych (who I have seen every 3-6 months for the past two years) has insisted on continuing the Lexapro nightly before bed (because the shit makes me sleepy), and then giving me Klonopin to use as an emergency brake for anxiety.   Which now that I think about it this cocktail doesn't really do shit for mania after all. The worst part about mania for me is that I don't know it's happening until it's way too late and I've scorched the earth and burned bridges.   I would go to see the psych right now, but I got dropped from my parents' insurance for the crime of turning 26.

lifehacks,"Nuttyfarts 4 points 1 day ago(+6/-1) A year ago I was a loner with no friends and I wasn't invited to any parties, and my mum would always brag about how she was a cool kid and was always at parties and telling me how I'm an uncool loner and how I need to go to parties. My dad was sick of seeing this and took me to the gym and I started to get in quite good shape for my age and I met some of the "cool kids" there and they start inviting me to places and I become a sociable person and spend a lot of time with these friends and they invite me too their parties at this point my mum decides I'm not allowed to go to parties and tries to cut me off from my friends this made me rebel against her and go to parties."
lifehacks,"I was hoping to enjoy a cold one using the suggested method and here are a few issues that I came across:   1) The top wants to curl into the can, you have to fish it out or let it clang around inside (think tuna can).   2) While the inside cut is clean and probably won't cut your upper lip (I did not confirm, see #3), the outside cut is jagged and looks like it will snag your lower lip.   3) Clean the can opener first, mine left bean residue all over the newly created opening (I should probably wash it regularly anyway, because it's pretty gross).   4) Even if you succeed past the above issues, the can opener wouldn't fully cut around the top and left it just awkwardly hanging there."
sharedota2,"well, you see, its a very good story.   in the old days i would only sit in a dark room for a long day playing DotA and chatting my friends on Ventrillo I was with a bunch of bitches who had no idea what they were doing. They kept on wanting to watch, when they had no idea what they were doing. They were hot as shit though, so i didnt really care.   Moving on, my mom came in the room, and i started screaming "We're sitting here in Ventrilo and playing a bit of DotA!". Little did she know, after listening to Huskaars voice for a little while saying "I feel you man", all of the guys and girls in the room, including myself were transported to a club, in which all of the girls started to suddenly strip their clothing, start to dance, and scream about how they loved me, who was apparently a Swedish pop star. I, however, knew all the words to a song about this same game i loved."

FIFA,"You can already customize formations in Team Management for normal teams, but it would be great in FUT. For example if someone has to use a Position Change CAM>CM for Chemistry reasons in a 4312 they would want that CM to play higher up the pitch, and could accomplish it by customizing formations.   Also to tell if your opponent customized their formation, it would show the exact diagram in another section on the team-viewing screen right before you enter the match."
FIFA,"If it's not malicious I see no problem with it. It's not your fault that your happiness and desire to watch the replays makes them emotionally upset.

FIFA,"I was having the same problem, always frustrated and getting annoyed as shit by all of the sweat in UT.  Then I stopped playing seasons and stick to cups/single matches. The difference is astounding. So much less sweat and bullshit.  Also, I picked this up from Japes, use players you like, play your own style (currently attempting the tiki taka short passing high possession style now and is awesome), and use players you enjoy using, not just the OP guys.  Seriously injected so much fun into UT. I don't worry myself about the W, just focus on playing my own style of fifa and having fun."
FIFA,"I'm going to piggyback the OP and agree.   I'm very new to FUT, but not FIFA. I play UT for fun because I don't have the time to dedicate to making absurd BBVA-BPL hybrids with IFs. So, I made a cheap Belgian Pro team made up only of African players. I play build up style and counter attack. It's fun even if I lose.   EXCEPT   when these people make super powerful teams and then just spam you. For instance, because I'm new, I was promoted to Div9 the other day. I have faced in Div 9 teams with gold players all over the board. Last night, I got beat into oblivion by a BBVA team consisting of 82+ rated Spanish players.   And all he did was cross and head.   I was down by a healthy margin so I was just passing it around to kill the clock and take my loss. But he continues to just cross and head and cross and head.   I still enjoy UT, but I get more joy playing against my buddies in the same room. We probably need to try online co-op."

FIFA,"Keylor Navas' card is a iMOTM, a special card. Usually IF's and other special cards recieve stats that will give them a higher rating than what their card says. When you then add up all the IF's and special cards he had last year, it accounts for a great amount of upgrades. If you look further down, in the comments, you will find this comment:  , where it says his real IG rating when you put in his IG stats to the player creator."
FIFA,"Funny. I've played CM exclusively since FIFA 10. Switched to FUT in FIFA 15. Playing against the CPU will never be the same.   The CPU is very predictable, even at the hardest dificulty. If you don't attack it, it doesn't try too hard to regain possession, even if it's losing like 3-0. If you cut every possible pass the CPU just holds possession until you free some space up for it to use and even then it's NEVER aggressive.   Winger gets a nice through ball and has the entire field for himself? No worries, the CPU stops right before the penalty area and turns, waits for you to come and reorganize your defense and then starts to furiously pass the ball.   Oh I forgot. The CPU almost never scores early on. It just casually misses crazy chances left and right, so you have time to get your shit together and start playing.   I don't know, the CPU is just largely pointless to play against."

highersidechats,"That is a tough call.  I'll share where I'm at and maybe you can extrapolate some useful tidbits.   Inspired by THC and many other factors (THC was a nice bold reminder that I should DO IT), I left my 9-5 IT job and started working for myself.  I've been working in the IT field for 10+ years with many people stating I should do it on my own, but I didn't feel confident enough to go on my own.  Fast forward to march of last year, there was some THC episode that I was listening to at work that just made me say... "  Fuck it! I'm wasting time waiting for shit to do, being underpaid for what I do."  I spent the next month prepping my LLC and gave one months notice.  In May of 2014, I left the job, and 12 of my previous clients followed me!  So I had some work already lined up.  Made more connections and here I am in Feb still making it through.  I have considered at times to take another job to "be safe" but in all honesty, work has been lucrative and paid the bills.  I will be taking a part time job at a yoga studio I teach at (less for monetary reasons, more for growth of the studio and my yoga practice), but ultimately , I am much happier working part time on my own hours, vs. 40+hrs a week , waking up early, many days waiting for work, and less time on myself.   My job paid $15/hr, while I can charge $50/hr on the low end for friends/family to $100!   IMO I would look into part time jobs/off jobs or something that can bring in some money.  I know someone only working a few part time jobs, but its flexible and allows her to travel/enjoy life.  Craigslist is where she got her jobs!   Full time jobs feel like a trap, and especially from my perspective, people do NOT effectively use the 8-10hrs/day on work.  Even bosses/upper management waste so much frickin time, its ridiculous.  Why not spend time more on what you do and what you love, rather than on someone elses dime, being forced to be somewhere, even with nothing to do?   This may have come off as a rant, but"
NoStupidQuestions,"Credit card companies will fold, as they no longer have any source of revenue to pay their employees.   Not really true. Credit card companies have two (or three) sources of revenue:     Fees on transactions. Credit card companies levy a small percentage fee on every transaction. You don't see this fee because the merchant pays it (which is why some stores like cash better). This source of revenue would be present as long as people used credit cards. Going with your prediction of increased spending, this source of revenue would increase.     Customers paying off their credit cards. This is also a source of revenue (but not profit, since you're just paying off one of the costs of the CC company). If this is done on time and in full (which everyone should do! don't accumulate credit card debt), it reduces costs and "turns" the transaction fees into profit.       2.5. People paying interest on their credit card debt. This is another source of revenue because it's extra money being paid (extra defined by money on top of cost from credit card purchases and repayments). But since this interest is generated by debt not being paid in full, in the short run  the revenue from interest combined with partial repayments on credit cards is not enough to turn a profit. However, in the long run , the interest payments accumulate and turn over profit.   I'm sure there are other ways of CC companies making money for revenue (yearly fees on premium cards, purchasing reward points, etc.), but these two and a half are the primary ways that I'm aware of. Given these, I don't think credit card companies will fold. Here's why:   For the first month or so, CC companies will not see any revenue from sources 2 and 2.5, but increased revenue from 1. They would be at an operating loss for that first month, but that's ok since it happens to companies [all the time]( This just means they don't make more money than they spent, it doesn't mean that they go into the negatives for money. Companies have cash reserves that are partially there to protect against this.   For the next month, financially sound people will be paying back their credit card debt. Costs for the CC company go down, income isn't as negative as it was before. People who were bad with credit cards are still bad with credit cards, and we return to the status quo.   > lead to high demand for most goods in the economy, while the supply of goods remains constant. Thus, this leads to rising prices and higher inflation in the economy.   Higher prices and higher inflation, only temporarily. Basic demand/supply (in an ideal market) teaches us that if the quantity demanded increases when quantity supplied stays the same, then, the price for that good goes up. This increase in demand isn't permanent though - CC companies called off debt once, but won't be any more. Since we return to the status quo from before debt call-off, the the price of goods returns too. This is a demand shock which normalizes itself. Large corporations that are hopefully sound in economics will not increase the price of goods, because they realize this demand shock is temporary and rising the prices will bite them in the ass when demand falls to normal levels. Even if some businesses do increase prices, they would have to bring them back down when demand falls to normal levels."
NoStupidQuestions,"It's not that the printer is using a VGA port, it's that VGA happens to commonly use a DB-15HD connector (the HD stands for "high density"), which is a member of the  D-subminiature family of connectors , it's not the only application.   Side note: VGA doesn't necessarily always use a DB-15HD connector. On Macs from the '90s, they used a DB-15 connector, which is wider and has only two rows of pins.

NoStupidQuestions,"Adrenaline is the "fight or flight" hormone. So its first problem is that it doesn't last very long, it's a short term fix to help you get yourself out of dangerous situations. As part of that, it also does two problematic things. Firstly, it messes with your heart rate, blood pressure and breathing, and can do so in unpredictable ways, making it difficult to give other drugs to counteract these effects. Secondly, it suppresses other functions that aren't necessary in a fight or flight situation, most notably the immune system (which is why it's given to people in anaphylactic shock), since a lot of people who are in pain are also sick, that's not good news, but also things like digestion (which is why an adrenaline rush sometimes makes you feel sick).   It may be possible to develop a painkiller that uses the same mechanism, and indeed, one may already exist, but you'd have to ask somebody who knows more about the nervous system than I do."
NoStupidQuestions,"To be honest, it can't. The fact that a massive fireball came out of the otherside proof it. The fuel tanks are house inside the wings, and that fireball could only happen if the tanks broke.   This doesn't take away that he's putting it severely out of context. Reality is a bit more like this. Plane cuts through the outer wall and a few colloms, starts oblivirating, wings probably seperate and continue their path of destruction another few rows of colloms further, explode and a huge fireball together with a lot of shrapnel and random crap exit the other side of the building."

NoStupidQuestions,"Generally there's nothing any wants to do, or can do with your IP.   There's two different IP you're using, and internal and external.   And also, like some one else said, IP work like addresses, both you and a website have one, and you're using them to send information between the two.   Getting an external ip is trivial, any time you access a website that website has access to your external ip. You can check your external ip online. If you've ever used a forum, you know about ip bans. They issue them so a person can't make another account from their house, obviously there's ways around this but that's their purpose. When running a forum I can see your external IP. Honestly it's really worthless knowledge without   1) serious knowledge 2) a person just completely disregarding all firewalls and shit   An internal ip works as an address as well, but it works from your computer to your router (yes there's loads of other things that go into this, but keeping it simple, that's how it works) just like an external ip works from your computer to a server.   There's more that you can do with your internal router than with your external, but it required you to all ready connected to your Internet.   You can tell the difference between the two when you  look at the numbers. Internal are generally pretty simple and stick to a pattern (192.168.0.0, 192.168.0.1, 10.0.0.1) while external look a little more random (72.185.32.1)"
NoStupidQuestions,"120 mph is indeed "that fast".   Any piece of airplane debris that has enough air resistance to slow your fall is going to be far above you because, surprise surprise, it's falling a lot slower than you.   The advice on where to land would be somewhat helpful if it weren't for the fact that you have almost no control over your trajectory when you're falling.   120 mph is fast enough that you're going to sustain about the same amount of damage no matter how you orient yourself when you land."
NoStupidQuestions,"I have incredibly realistic, emotionally upsetting dreams almost nightly, and have for as long as I can remember. I would love to be able to lucid dream, because it is awful trying to fall asleep knowing that I'll essentially be stuck experiencing a feasible, realistic horror (often involving terrible things happening to my close family). They come on in a slow way and I feel the passage of time and often experience the time after the bad stuff happens, experiencing waking up for days and weeks and months knowing that this happened and living my life with it heavy on my heart...all in my dream. Then I actually wake up, my heart beating out of my chest, and it's a massive mindfuck of trying to grasp that this is the true reality, because NOW I can tell the difference from the dream wake up and this real wake up, but I felt like I just lived days or weeks or months with this horrible thing having happened. Sometimes I just burst into tears at all the emotions and anxiety I've felt, and at the knowledge that the bad thing didn't really happen, everyone is ok. Sometimes i rush into my toddler daughter's room and lay a hand on her back and feel her soft breathing to make sure that she's definitely, for sure for sure ok. Most of the time, now that it's been going on for as long as I can remember,  I just try to breathe and remind myself it wasn't real, and snuggle up to my husband.   All this happens 4-7 times a week, sometimes multiple times nightly. There are triggers that can cause more of these each night, like watching scary or super disturbing movies, so I try to avoid them. But yeah...you might say it's a fucking nightmare. True story. I have no idea if this is weird or if it happens to most people."
NoStupidQuestions,"Even though Alej doesn't seem to be used, in Spanish it would probably be pronounced /alex/ (ironically).   That's an IPA transcription, so I'll explain each letter.   Imagine a thick Boston accent, the "Pahk yah car in Hahvad yahd" kind of accent. The "ah" sound in "Pahk" or "yahd" is /a/.   /l/ is just an l sound.   /e/ is similar to the vowel in "bed", but with your tongue higher up in your mouth. (If you're Australian, it likely  is  the vowel in "bed"). Another way to look at it is that in English, the "ay" sound like in "lay", is a diphthong, meaning it's actually two vowels in quick succession. The first vowel is /e/, the second one is the vowel in the word "in". Just pronounce the first half of the diphthong and that's /e/.   /x/ isn't an x sound like in "Alex" it's actually the same sound in the German pronunciation of "Bach" or the Scottish pronunciation of "loch".   Congrats! You can now say "Alej" like a Spanish speaker! If only Alej were actually used..."
NoStupidQuestions,"the people who have these conditions and really, truly, honestly don't eat that much or that unhealthily, but they're still obese.   But they are eating too much. Some conditions drastically affect the energy efficiency of digestion. The 2500 or so calories estimate that works for most people, who have roughly 20% efficiency in terms of getting energy out of their food. Some people, out of the same food, get more or less energy out of their food. So what may be a 1000 calorie sandwich for me could be hundreds more or less to others with medical conditions."
incremental_games,"I don't disagree with this idea, but implementation is the part that makes me hesitate.  Categorization is a complicated beast that is prone to opinionated bias.   Let me give you a for instance:   For many, many, many years (months?  years?  a lot of time) I have been hugely disappointed that Mass Effect won RPG of the Year over Borderlands.  Mass Effect has some RPG elements, but in my opinion (Notice opinion) was just a shadow of an example of the RPG genre compared to Borderlands, which even there is not my first choice when thinking of an RPG example.   Even in a genre that should be extremely broad, like Incremental Games, there is a lot of opinion as to what should or should not be placed in that category.  If I said that Borderlands was an Incremental, most people (myself included) would cry shenanigans.  However, at the most literal definition, you are earning money and experience that you use to improve your character so that you can fight stronger enemies and gain more money and experience.   Back on the original topic.  I don't really see how we could easily sub-categorize incremental games with a great deal of opinion.  People would say that Tap Titans in virtually the same as Clicker Heroes and Tap Tap Infinity.  However, Tap Titans is mobile, Clicker Heroes is web based and Tap Tap Infinity is both.  AdVenture Capitalist has a lot of the same elements and Clicking Bad and Idle Oil Tycoon, but I wouldn't say they are anything even close to the same game or the same category.   What I would love to see (And now that I think about it, I don't know why I wouldn't do it myself) is an Incremental Review Site or Blog.  If such a thing exists, would could provide links in the Ultimate List to the game's review and let people draw their own conclusions as to what game it is similar to and if they want to give it a try.   Just my two copper pieces.  Take it for what you will."
incremental_games,"I know there's a lot of pointed disinterest in this idea, but it's not a bad one at all. The point isn't wether or not there are active developers or if "they are all incremental games". The problem is that  incremental  isn't a genre in the  gameplay  sense, but in the  mechanics  sense. If someone asks you what "type of game" something is and you say  platformer , how are they going to know you mean Maplestory and not Super Meatboy? If you had said "mmo" or "arcade" instead, it would have made a lot more sense from the beginning not only what you were talking about, but also gives them context for if they want to check it out, or understand discussion about it. That's becasue "mmo" and "arcade" aren't related to mechanics, they are related to gameplay style, and one can instantly have a base idea for what the viewpoint, setting, mechanics, graphics, and gui are probably going to be like, which is the point entirely.   MY PROPOSAL: Consider that a dark room is COMPLETELY different than cookie clicker, but is still "incremental". Describing a title with a simple preexisting subgenre would be both instantly understandable and very useful...     Cookie clicker clicking bad, adventure capitalist, swarm simulator (games whose purpose is to aquire resources first and foremost, to prestige, to upgrade production speed):  tycoon incremental     A dark room, kittens game, critter mound, (an expanding population with complex needs, war and exploration):  civ incremental     A dark room, candy box, ect (upgrades are used to get better stats in minigames and unlock new play styles, ect):  rpg incremental       Some games have both civ and rpg elements, specifically thinking of a dark room, which could be called a civ/rpg incremental. However, since  all  incrementals have tycoon elements, "tycoons incrementals" would simply be all games that don't deviate from the base model by including other elements.   just my two cents have a great day"
agnostic,"The difference, for me, is that the concept of a 'god' isn't inherently entwined with something definable, measurable, and provable. A 'god', to me, could basically be anything with a significant power over aspects of this universe that link to creation/destruction, causality and some form of 'fate'. If a human were to create something to give them similar mechanisms, I'd probably argue that they could undertake the definition as well. If a human were to have similar mechanisms that allowed them to do the same on another world, it wouldn't be too much different than what we know has happened here, as far as they're concerned. It's like that old saying that there isn't a functional difference between god and an all-knowing, all-powerful wizard: it's just a semantic that we've attached a far greater meaning to.   Fairies have a less arbitrary definition, although perhaps still a subjective one. The fairy that comes to mind when I think about such things is a small humanoid creature with wings and probably lives in a forest. I have never seen, nor heard about such things existing with accountable evidence, and as such, I have enough reason to disbelieve in the concept. Dragons are similar.   Regarding the whole 'invisible, intangible, omnipresent rhinoceros' thing that some people like to spout as evidence against god/God, I'd say that if you change the properties of something that much, then it's a pretty weak argument for it still fitting the definition of what we know to be a rhinoceros.   Ghosts are a bit trickier, since the definition of a ghost isn't quite so fixed. To some, it's a physical manifestation of the soul of a dead-person while to others, it's some kind of nether-being that enacts its will upon this world in the form of flickering lights and radios that consistently play Frank Sinatra without human intervention. My disbelief in this would probably be more of a choice, seeming as I can't disprove the concept entirely, but it's still a premise that is largely defined as something that exists (through some manner) on this earth. I have never seen the physical manifestation of a dead person to my knowledge, nor have I seen lights flickering supernaturally and Frank Sinatra playing from beyond the grave. As such, due to my own lack of personal experience and hearing of first-hand accounts from reputable sources,  I disbelieve it   'The Matrix' bit, or something comparable to it, is a great question to ask agnostics. My own take on it is basically  Chuang Tzu's famous poem about butterflies.   Edit:"
agnostic,"There seem to be mixed opinions here, and none of them are wrong. This is a case-by-case kind of thing; it depends on how you feel and how your family is.   Here is how things went for me: I was 16 or 17, I don't really remember. I had gone to a Catholic elementary school, but a public high school. In high school I went to the "Sunday school" that my family's church had for teenagers preparing to be Confirmed. I did everything I was required to be Confirmed, and decided not to. If you're Catholic, you know what Confirmation is, and I couldn't go through with it because it felt dishonest since I was agnostic. I "came out" to my father (the most religious in my family) in a meeting with my pastor that I had scheduled to let them know I didn't want to be Confirmed.   They were very understanding. My pastor actually agreed that I shouldn't be Confirmed if I didn't feel like I was truly Catholic, and encouraged me to find my own spiritual path. My father just wanted to understand, and while he seemed disappointed at first, I talked to him for hours explaining how I felt and what I believed and why I didn't feel those beliefs were compatible with Catholicism.   My family accepted who I am and what I believe, and my dad stopped pressuring me to go to church with them, lead grace at dinner time, etc. I do still go to Mass with them at Christmas, Easter, and things like that, just because I think it's important to do something as a family, and I want to support they're beliefs just like they do for me. In fact, this past Christmas I was the only one that didn't complain about the super long service.   But this is my experience, with my family. I know parents who would respond much more negatively, and you should be cautious. You know your family and only you can figure out how and when to "come out."   Just know that we're here for you!   **"
agnostic,"I'm not the biggest fan of some of my parents methods for raising myself or my brothers/sister, but one thing I'm immeasurably grateful for is that, from day 1, as soon as I could understand English, they let me grow to be my own person. When it came to religion, well, I can still hear my dad explaining to me when I was 4 that if I ever wanted to take up religion, they would support me and take me to church (or whatever was applicable). I never did feel the need to be particularly religious.   Another major factor is my drive to do what should be done. There's never really one single right answer, but I always strive to get as close to one of them as I can. That means, among other things, not ignoring any possiblilty, no matter how unlikely I think it is or whether or not I want it to be right or wrong. Frankly, I've been playing with the idea that I'm some kind of functional depressed, but the one thing I've really consistently felt pride about myself for is my logical, rational thought."
minnesotavikings,"Great point.   I look at it this way.  I've gotten in a bar fight or two in my stupid, drunken youth. I'm sure many of us have.  Is it a crime?  Yes - it's technically assault and battery.  But I was never arrested for it, never shunned for it by society or my friends or family.  Bloody nose, sore knuckles, etc. were about the worst I ever got or gave out of it - as is the case with most bar fights.   But imagine getting the upper hand on a guy, and all of a sudden you're on top of him.  He's helpless, arms pinned, and nobody there is intervening.  You have complete control over whether this guy walks away with just a bloody nose, or ends up in a coma or dead.   At that moment, IMHO, you become completely liable for any result that occurs - whether or not you intended it.   If you hit him even 2 or 3 more times and he ends up with severe damage?  I don't feel sorry for you or feel an injustice has occurred if you end up getting arrested and charged, regardless of your intent.  You were in complete control and threw the punches.  Maybe you just wanted to teach the guy a lesson?  Too bad.  The lesson is now yours.   So now put that idea into the context of an NFL player disciplining a 4 year old child.  You want to teach a four year old a lesson?  Fine, punish him.  You want to use corporal punishment and believe that lessons need to be learned by spanking?  Fine, spank him on the bottom with your hand a few times.  Feel free to even make it sting a little.  I don't agree with it (not at that age), but I can understand the logic behind it to a degree.   Taking a tree branch and whipping a naked 4 year old child with it repeatedly as though he were a slave getting a whipping?  Come on, man.   That's a whole other level.  That's like beating the helpless guy over and over in my example above."

You want to be able to get 200 food every 30 seconds so you can make 8 villagers a minute. Only que up one villager at a time in your TC, and use the excess food on eco/military upgrades. While doing this, you should also be using excess wood on military buildings. Once you're good on food/wood to continue building military buildings + villagers constantly, assign 2 TCs to gold so you get your 800 gold fast. Click up to imp around 30 minutes in. By the time imp rolls around, you should have 20-30 military units and a few military upgrades. Just keep producing and upgrading from this point on."

AskCulinary,"From a chemical standpoint, it has to do with the incorporation of fat and liquids in your final product. Cookie dough is an emulsion - a mixture of two compounds (fat and water) that can't usually bond. Emulsions are fragile by nature, and prone to breaking. Keeping cookie dough too long at room temperature, over handling while shaping - these are things that will "break" your emulsion, and cause the fat to separate into the oily substance you sometimes find in flat cookies. Chilling your dough before forming and before baking, and any time that it begins to get overwarm, helps to keep the dough intact.   The greatest benefit, however, is during baking itself. Cookie recipes are often chemically leavened - with baking powder or baking soda. And cookie recipes often contain butter. Butter is itself an emulsion, being composed of several parts fat (about 80% in the states) and water (along with small quantities of sugar and protein). When butter is heated in a mixture like cookie dough, one of two things may happen: The emulsion may break, and the fat begin to leak, OR the water may turn to steam, creating small pockets of water vapor that act as barriers to fat and help the product to rise. Bringing your dough rapidly from chilled to oven temperature allows water to steam before the fat melts, keeping your cookie in one happy, homogeneous package - instead of spread onto your baking sheet."
AskCulinary,"I'm from the States, but my family is Italian and we've always prepared them the same was as far as I know. To me, it's the best way to eat an artichoke.     Hit the artichoke on the counter upside down a few times- This loosens the leaves.   Work the leaves a little bit to open them up and get some gaps in them.   Pour Italian breadcrumbs (or breadcrumbs flavored with Italian herbs) into the leaves. Make sure to get breadcrumbs down in all the nooks and crannies.   Drizzle olive oil over the entire artichoke. Not so much that you're soaking the breadcrumbs, but enough that the breadcrumbs are moistened. (Too little and it will turn out dry, too much and it will be soggy).   Put the artichoke in a pressure cooker and allow it to steam for about 20 minutes, then turn off the heat and let it sit in the cooker until the pressure subsides.     Eat it by pulling off a leaf at a time and scraping it against your teeth.  You get the flesh of the leaf and the breadcrumbs with each bite, and the stalky part is left behind.   After you eat the leaves, the heart is left. Cut off all the fuzzy stuff because it's sharp and will make you choke.  Then eat the heart, it's the best part!"

You can make ballin' individual size fancy pants pizzas in a cast iron pan that will blow your mind. It's super fast and easy and delicious.

Corn bread is tasty as heck and bakes up in a cast iron pan better than anything else I have tried.   Steak and chicken and fish in a flat bottomed skillet may not have pretty grill lines on there, but it will be just as tasty as that grill pan.

AskCulinary,"Everyone. Get a butter boat. These things are the cat's pajamas. It is a 3 piece set- a porcelain butter dish (and lid) that fits on top of a larger container that is filled with cool water. This keeps the butter just below room temperature for perfect spreadability.  But wait, it gets better! In the summer when it is hot, as the water evaporates, it creates an endothermic reaction, thus lowering the temperature of the butter dish, and your butter is STILL PERFECTLY SPREADABLE. Science."
AskCulinary,"Because the water can  EXPLODE .   Heating water in a very clean vessel (cup) in the microwave can cause it to superheat which means the temperature is above the boiling point of water without actually boiling. When you agitate the vessel by grabbing it the sudden disturbance causes all the water to suddenly boil, splashing superhot water over your arm.   The reason it can superheat is because there are no nucleation* sites in a clean cup. Nucleation sites are small imperfections where bubbles can form. Putting a wooden skewer or something in the cup will provide the nucleation sites making sure your water doesn't explode."

Coffee,"A gooseneck kettle is still slightly preferable for the Aeropress as it's much easier to pour the right amount in during the initial wetting (for bloom) with a gooseneck however it's not essential like it is for some other brew methods (I had my Aeropress for a year before I purchased a gooseneck kettle).   If all the kettle is going to be used for is the Aeropress (and not, say making tea), then I'd recommend the Bonavita Electric Kettle ( and a thermometer ( (this is the exact setup I have, btw). There are a few reasons for this recommendation (over the Hamilton Beach):     The Bonavita should be more reliable over the long term since it is a simpler design and thus has less that can go wrong with it.   If you should ever decide to expand your coffee brewing methods, you will already have a great gooseneck kettle and thus won't have to make another purchase. The Aeropress is a bit of a gateway drug in this regard and its not uncommon for people to post about making their Aeropress purchase and then a year later they have an entire coffee battlestation lol.   If you wait, the Bonavita electric kettle normally sells for about $45-$50 (currently it's $60) which isn't much more than the Hamilton Beach one. If you really want the programmable aspect, Bonavita sells one for about $90-$100, too.   As I already mentioned, a gooseneck, while not essential for Aeropress, does make using the Aeropress easier and has less chance of dumping scalding water everywhere (it can happen...not that I ever did that or anything. Nope, nope.)"
Coffee,"The pods are used with pressurized portafilter machines.  Using a PPF machine with ground coffee directly in the basket presents additional backpressure so some pod machines might deploy slightly higher back pressure to improve results, but some PPF machines use the same basket for pods and ground coffee.  No matter what configuration is used, the results any PPF device are very, very poor compared to competently prepared espresso using a capable machine and grinder.  The manufacturers of PPF bank on low expectations and uneducated purchasers so they don't typically get too technical about things."
Coffee,"Caffeine is really no good for the adolescent brain   Care to share the source for this?   All I can find is a whole bunch of articles that point to one PLOS study (can't access the original) on rats which indicated that caffeine consumption in rats reduced their sleep which in turn slowed brain development. They were given 30 mg of caffeine per day (naively scaling up 30 mg for a 1.2 lb animal - which seems big for a lab rat, based on what I can find - to say, a 90 lb animal, that's the equivalent of 2,250 mg of caffeine a day, or 15 cups of coffee, minimum.   So it's not caffeine, per se, that damages  rat brain development , but a reduction in sleep which can be caused by an excessive consumption of caffeine.   I started drinking coffee at 14 and suffered no known brain development issues. Graduated high school with honors at 23!   > slight difference in taste   ^slight^gigantic"

It's things like that that give me hope for human kind. My sister had a chi huahua mix dog, yes it barked a lot, but he was one playful and affectionate little fella. Long story short I have really jerk neighbors and a man that was fixing the apartment on top of ours saw someone visiting those same neighbors and since the bottom apartment (ours) had a small yard our dog was playing there. Well the guy that was fixing the aparments saw the same people that visited those dick neighbors break the fence and chase the little guy around into the street. That was the last that we saw of him. He was probably dognapped and I fear worse. We tried to get the authorities involves, but nothing has come of it. All this happened while my sister was at school. and what I really hate is that I was in mexico at the time (still am)  so I couldn't really do anything about it. And what really burns my ass is that my sister heard those same dick-ass neghbors gloat about how the dog wasn't there anymore. We never even did anything to them to provoke this.

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,"It was New Year's Eve, 2007 I believe. My dog had just squeezed his body between the narrow slip of dirt and the fence. Just as he got out of the yard I glanced out of my window to see is he was ready to come back in side. I saw him run into the vast woods behind my house. I ran out after him. I fallowed his trail of dog prints in the very thin layer of snow for as long as I could. I came across a field with now snow and the trail was gone. As I was walking back through the pitch black I heard a very loud yelp from my right. It was my dog Boomer. I ran and ran, the yelps got louder, I was becoming very close. I ran through a muddy swamp. I sunk down to about waste deep. I was stuck. The temperature was around freezing. I managed to grab a branch and pull myself out. My legs were going numb. About 100 yards ahead there was a peninsula,when I got to it I heard one more yelp. It was the loudest. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever heard. I thought Boomer was going to be gone forever. Just then I saw a small figure of an animal lying in a small field (not the same one as earlier). It was Boomer. As I drew near Boomer looked up at me, it was the happiest moment of my life knowing that my dog was ok. I found a way home on dry land and carried Boomer home. I lit a fire and lied him down to get warm. He was covered in blood and dirt. I took a quick shower and got changed. I drew a warm bath for Boomer to get rid of the dirt and blood. All the blood came off. Not his blood. All the dirt came off. It seemed like there was no cuts or broken bones. While I was drying him off he looked up at me. One eye was all red and puffy. I had no idea on what was wrong. First thing in the morning I brought him to the vet. There were puncture wounds on the back side of his eye. It would be impossible to fix. The vet said they could put in a glass eye but it wouldn't look natural. The vet also said that they could just remove the eye and sew up the socket. I deiced it would be better to just let them sew up the socket. Boomer is still as playful and energetic as he was when he was a pup. On June 17 he is turning 11."

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,"Great question! [Warning: Longish story follows]   One time I was eating M&M's out of my hand. I looked down and realised that I had only blue ones and orange ones left. Out of curiosity I put my hands together and started to shake them around. Then, while still shaking my hands, I looked inside and I saw a new colour.   It wasn't blue and orange mixed together, because when you mix them together you get brown, but it was blue and orange in the same place at the same time.   So I called it "blorange", it is a colour I invented.   [Let me pause the story for a second and provide some filler information, after this eventful day of colour inventing I started to recount the tale exactly as recorded above. Well, suffice it to say, the story was quickly well know among my friends and church mates and also the skill with which I would tell the story with the exact same words every time. Additionally, following the point I met my wife]   Before my wife and I got married, for Christmas one year, she presented me with "blorange" thongs. I thanked her and was very happy but then tentatively asked "you know I am going to wear these right?" feeling worried that they were in her mind a joke gift, and that she would be embarrassed in public with me and the odd thongs. She replied with a giant smile "Of course! That is what they are for!" and it was at that moment that I knew she was a keeper.   [Actually I knew she was a keeper beforehand but that is another story]   So I wore those "blorange" thongs for 3 years at every opportune moment, and was well recognised for it as well until they developed holes in the bottom. Regretfully, I had to retire them and so with a sigh of defeat I place them into the back of the shoe draw for the last time. When I saw my wife next I told her of the fate of the "blorange" thongs and she suddenly pulled out the next pair! See, she had just bought a pair of blue thongs and a pair of orange ones and then stored the opposites all those years. So now I am working my way through those and that my friends is the story of my "blorange" thongs."
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,"As someone who had never read the books (for obvious reasons) i was pleasantly surprised by the trailer, the cinematography was pretty good and the acting wasn't appalling. I probably won't see it but it looks better than i thought it would.   The best book to film adaptations i can think of is the Harry Potter books that, while they have their problems but they captured the feel of the books pretty well.   Now the worst adaptation i have ever seen is without a doubt World War Z, as a film it's alright, its full of cliche's and some pretty bad writing but as an adaptation of the book it's goddamn garbage. There are only 3 parts in the entire film that actually feature in the book, the wall of Israel, the fact that in Korea everyone had their teeth removed and the fact that there's a nuclear explosion. THATS IT. Fuck the geo-political narrative, fuck the assessment of the human condition and the lengths it will go to to survive, fuck the book lets make a film about Brad Pitt single-handedly saving the world from these super spooky zombies. In the book theres a great part about how Iran and Pakistan have an escalating conflict over people fleeing into Iran which ends in a nuclear war between them, in the film it's just "Oh look a mushroom cloud! Lets totally ignore that and keep going!". Apparently the original ending was somewhat closer to the book, with Brad Pitt in Moscow but they re-shot the ENTIRE THIRD ACT because they didn't want it being to overtly political. THAT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL BOOK YOU NUMNUTS. They completely abandoned the source material in favour of turning it into a dumb Summer blockbuster of Brad Pitt being a one man superhero and saving the world."

Over the years of their marriage, my parents managed to collect several different nativity sets. My Dad is Mr. Dollar Store so a lot of said sets are absolute crap.

So for 3 refined it's about $1.50. As everyone knows keys are about 2.44-2.55 refined. So you're making .22 refined per key sold, and if sold in large quantities like everyone is, you're making keys a day. I've studied the market on selling and buy keys and refined and it's pretty damn brilliant."

Screenwriting,"I think Boyhood's value is in it's honestly. There are certainly some cliche moments, but they are honest cliches to the character.   Mason's stoned philosophizing are entirely true to his character.   Olivia's 'parade of drunken assholes' are a testament to her seeking out first stability and secondly a role model in her home. And while both men succumbed to their fragility (the professor's disappointment in his biological son and the soldier's re-acclimatization into America proper) they were true characters.   That it was shot over the time span it was allowed Linklater the malleability to refine characters to the times rather than fit written characters shifted norms.   While many of us don't have the luxury of shooting 3 pages at a time as a script defines itself, BOYHOOD is far from merely a product of it's production method. We as audiences have accepted actors at different ages portraying the same character. We have accepted  different  actors portraying the same character at the same age. Linklater's great talent as a filmmaker is that he can still experiment with form (A Scanner Darkly, Waking Life, Before*, and now BOYHOOD ) without taking away from the narrative progression and characters in his screenplays.   I saw it last night, and may be rambling."

I avoided all the chemical drugs like the plague for from when I was young until I was grown. While all my friends were experimenting with this and that, I stayed away and said no. Finally at 26 I decide I'll just try it.   Imagine climbing mount everest with a group of your friends and how good it would feel to be at the very top of the mountain just looking down on the world. That feeling of accomplishment, joy, and euphoria.   Times that by 100 and add a soundtrack of the best music you've ever heard in your entire life that sounds better to your ears then anything you've ever experienced. oh and  your body is feeling so good that even the feeling of your sock inside of your shoe rubbing against your foot is enough to almost make you orgasm harder than you ever have in your life. The touch from another human being is like being touched by God himself.   All of a sudden everyone seems happy and friendly. The world now seems like a heaven of possibility where everything is bright, glowing, radiant, and nothing could go wrong.   Rolling.   All you want to do is talk, everything you say and hear is both warm, profound, and life changing. The people you know you feel like you've known them forever and you feel more connected to them and humanity as a whole life you've never experienced before.   For the first time in your life, you're the fuckin cool guy and you can feel it with every ounce of your being. All the approval, validation, admiration, and the rest is now all pumping through every part of you.   For the first time in my life I felt a deep release from everything that ever held me down. Everything was going to be ok.   This too shall pass.   Slowly descending down from heaven back to earth.   And for the next week while I was after glowing, I felt pretty fuckin good.   I'm a very smart guy. I write code too. Before I tried any of that stuff I researched the shit out of it. I spent time on Erowid, Bluelight, and a few other sites learning as much as I could before I tried. The half a pill I had that night was so powerful that in a split second I was complete transformed as a person. It shook the foundations to everything I've ever known. A pandora's box had been opened up that could never be closed.   Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you not to do drugs. For most people their minds are already made up.   The experience I had along with the people I was hanging out with, the situation I was in, my life at the time, and my selfishness was enough to turn me to a drug addict from the very first pill I took. Its fucked up. Going from hating drugs and never touching them, to doing them once, and becoming an addict. Within my first few months I had overdosed (bad pills), another overdose (pills where methamphetamine not E), and lost my job. By the start of the next year I had another overdose, tried to kil myself, and got serotonin syndrome* like you wouldn't believe.   Its like Russian roulette with your life. I'm not going to sit here and say that by taking an E you're going to become an addict or even fuck your life over. Chances are you'll have a good experience with your people, grow closer, and feel like a better person for doing so. What I am saying is that the experience I had was so majestical, profound, and life altering that it planted the idea in my head the doing Es and Ms is a good idea. This is what makes me an addict, that given everything thats happened with all the pain and bullshit, that taking more pills is a good idea.   I don't do drugs anymore. The entire experience during my year and some of taking pills was quite enlightening. The cost was pretty high but while I was in rehab I heard a story from one of the consolers which changed my fucking life. The story was about a shaman training his apprentice. It comes time for the master to train the prot茅g茅 in psychedelic plants and that kinda stuff. So the shaman gives the kid a sack full of psychedelic shit and he does them for a year. At the end of the year the shaman tells the apprentice, thats it, no more, now you know.   * Serotonin syndrome for me aside from the fact that everything was fucked was when it came time to getting to sleep. As soon as I started to get tired I would get intermittent and painful brain shocks that would start from what felt like the bottom of my brain stem all throughout my head. Right as I was starting to goto sleep, my eyes would stay open and I would start having nightmares where I'd be conscious enough to experience them but sleeping enough to not be able to move at all. Right before I would come awake my eyes would open again and for the next few minutes I'd have another bout of sleep paralysis and horrible nightmares about monsters I can't describe. This shit went on for months. I haven't touch drugs in awhile but still have horrible nightmares all the time."

TruePokemon,"I suppose that's one way of looking at it.  I, however, am given to believe that Mega-evolutions are merely a scientific augmentation of certain species, similar to steroids or Bane-venom.  The energy given off by stones  coincidentally  resonates with certain species of Pokemon, and this allows them to evolve further.  I cannot claim this theory is infallible, but that is how I view it.   However, your idea certainly reinforces the themes of the Pokemon franchise.  Pokemon and people can achieve greater things together.  Trainers allow Pokemon to grow stronger (stone of friendship evolution, EVs, Mega-evolution, just to name a few) and Pokemon allow people to have new experiences, such as traveling, making meaningful relationships, personal growth and discovery, teaching responsibility and independence.   Whether or not Pokemon were created to be trained, though, is a unique question.  We would have to look back into the mythology of the creation of the Pokemon world, and we would have to see where people, Pokemon, and the Mega-stone system came from.  IIRC, the Sinnoh saga leads us to believe that humans and Pokemon were once the same, so perhaps the split between the two is related to the creation of the Mega stones.   Disturbing hypothesis:  Some group of people used some form of science or magic to control another part of the population, leading to their mutation into Pokemon and the creation of the Mega stones.   Alternatively, perhaps a deity created Pokemon and the Mega stones as a gift or helper to humanity, like God created Eve as a helper to Adam.  (To be clear:  Do not take that to mean I think of women as inherently subordinate to men.  I was merely drawing a narrative comparison)"
wii,"I had the same problem.   I owned a Nyko and eForCity Wii charge base before, and the batteries and covers were very quick to discharge or break. All I wanted to do is buy new batteries, but all replacements cost far more then the original cost. After researching new Wii remote chargers, I found that all of them gave similar or worse issues.   I instead bought an awesome [battery charger](  This charges AA's in 15 minutes, so it's multitudes faster than anything else made for the Wii. That means that you can get back to playing sooner. This is also the most cost effective solution because unlike Wii remote chargers you can easily purchase new batteries at a reasonable costs. Yes, you may have to take off the covers every once in a while, but consider the amount of positives."
LawSchool,"The shortage of hard science guys is an area fraught with misunderstanding and misinformation. I will address STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math).   For the point, skip down to the next bold text   We actually have surpluses of the STEM graduates in the USA. But a few areas are badly hurt because of the composition of our STEM workforce. In basic research, upper-level positions don't move much (people live longer, and the baby boomers occupy many of the top positions, and won't be leaving them any time soon, and many older researchers possess skills that aren't easily replaced or taught, such as methodologies for - say - cell culturing). Tenure becomes all but impossible to get, and professorships are risky propositions for professional post-docs who can make 60k+ per year doing reliably available lab work for someone else. Relatively speaking, it's worse for a physicist than it is for a biologist or chemist right now.   Engineers are always in demand, but even this is misleading. The US has a surplus of engineers in it! But certain areas face major deficits, or only narrowly meet demand. The best examples are military. Sensitive projects that meet national defense requirements cannot have foreign nationals working on them for security reasons. This means the Navy (I choose it because it does a tremendous amount of advanced research and engineering) doesn't have enough US born engineers and scientists to reliably meet its needs.   Why is this? Well, the US imports the best and brightest minds from around the world. The top graduates of India and China come here, and they often stay here because the quality of life is so much better. This presents three problems. First, it's cheap labor that de-incentivizes native US graduates from entering the engineering fields. Secondly, the US is less able to keep these people here anymore, and we're seeing a slow decline in available top students from other countries (this is partially a brain-drain phenomena, and partially a lack of interest in coming to the US). Thirdly, we find that foreign STEM graduates often lack the interest or ability to enter the higher levels of STEM fields.   This phenomena seems to be related to cultural and linguistic factors. The cultural factors are two-fold: most US graduates will not work as hard as foreigners, and certainly not for as little compensation. Secondly, many foreign graduates rely on rote training (programs of learning common in Asia in particular, where "high school" on up focuses on rote methods). A major problem we have is that our foreign graduates do not innovate and lack initiative to strike out on their own research and projects. Also, if you've ever spent any time working in a large research lab, you may notice that the ethnic groups tend to cluster together. Many foreign graduates do not speak English (or even Spanish) competently in a work setting, and they often don't make the effort to learn.   Now, there's a whole barrel of nuances and issues here that I didn't bother mentioning, because I want to move on to the point:   Hard science (and math) is seen as reflecting an ability to think critically above and beyond that of most people, like English majors or political science majors. This is probably unfair, but there is definitely a deficit of people who have developed hard (quantitative) analysis skills. A premium is paid for them, and US science graduates can get incredibly lucrative jobs on Wall Street that offer inordinate rewards relative to the effort put in, and help pay down that school debt many carry. This is, in part, related to degree inflation as well. Firms that would've taken a liberal arts major in the seventies may well rule them out now (maybe all schools should go to a bell curve distribution for grades, and stick C as the 50^th percentile, hah).   It's not a lack of these people that's hurting us, it's that appropriate compensation and opportunity aren't available to the ones who choose to stay in the hard sciences. I doubt we'll see much change in this until the US is seriously competing with China, India and Europe to do the real, innovative and influential research (hint: China and India are not doing much meaningful research yet, but they're doing a hell of a lot more than they were 15 years ago)."
LawSchool,"It's not as bad as the hype says it is. Remember that the stories you hear only come from the people that care to tell them, and the people who did sink $150k into school and now don't have a job usually care about telling their story (and telling it loudly). The people who don't have a problem finding jobs don't take to the internet and post about it.   Also contrary to popular belief, you don't need to go to a T20 or a T14 or a T6 school to land a job. Take, for example, the Denver area job market - it's dominated by CU, which is well into the latter half of tier 1 schools. Same things in Seattle - UW and SU dominate the market, UW being ranked similarly to CU, and SU being midway through tier 2 (I think they are like #75, but are also #1 for legal writing... case in point - who really believes the "rankings" ?)...   My experience? Without being too specific, I had a 3.9 GPA and an LSAT in the low 160's. Got into some great schools, transferred from a public to private school (which is WAY better IMHO). My law school GPA isn't great, but not bad either, and I have a steady job as a law clerk. I'm not really that worried about finding a job after graduation... by now I'm familiar with the work of the major firms in the area and talking intelligibly in an interview about the areas of law I'm interested in is not a problem at all..."

cars,"Backstory: This F250 has been in my family since i can even literally remember. One day on the way home (Nebraska) from Oklahoma we were pulling a trailer and see smoke from the under the hood. So we jump out and pop the hood and low and behold the damn things on fire. Luckily we were at a rest stop and a couple truckers had extinguishers. But it was too late much of the truck had been burned. Come to find out a fuel line had broken. Well it was the only truck we had at the time that could pull and money was tight so we replaced the interior and got her running right and continued to use it. About a year later my father and I were changing the oil and hear a clank in the drain pan. I looked through and to my amazement was piece of the piston skirt. So the truck got parked and the family got a new one. Several years later i decided i missed it and sanded it down and painted it white. Took the motor out and replaced it with a fresh one i built myself. Now its as happy as can be with no rust and a healthy 460. Its basically a toy that i take out in the backwoods with friends now since it doesnt go too far at 5-6mpg."
cars,"Fresh out of school, eh?  Let's get serious for a second.  Does the car you have right now work?  Do you really need a car payment?  Are you sure that your job won't lose a contract and you'll be dropped in the first 3 months?   I ask this because I've had several friends go through this.  "I got a job! Look at my new car!" 76 days later..."Well, they lost the bid they hired me for, so, I'm looking for a new job...and I didn't work with them long enough to get unemployment."   A $20-30k NEW car is a lot for someone getting their first out-of-school job, though I'm assuming you're not a lawyer or working a management role in some oil field I don't know about in Iowa.   Seriously, car payments suck.  I make good money and my $400/mo payment bums me out.  I waited a year after I got my job, was like "Yeah, I can pull this off," but, no, that's a huge chunk of change just gone.  My insurance and gas receipts went up, too, because I went from a get-me-through-school Toyota Echo to a Mazda3.  What's your credit like?  If it's good, you may be okay, but if it's under 700 like fresh-out-of-college kids who've only had a credit card in their name for a couple of years, you may be hurting yourself.   Anyway, that's a lot of what ifs.  You may be in good standing, have the money to spare, may have a beater of a car or no car at all; it may be good for you to get a car right off the bat. However, if you can survive with the car you have now, I would  highly recommend  dumping what you think you would run on a car payment into a Roth IRA or your 401(k) for the first year.  Then, as you get a raise, that money stays funneling in there and you can be more settled into your monthly routine and know how much you can spare on a car.  That's the other thing: you think you know what your budget will be like, but until you get to the job and even out your social life, figure out if the place you rent sucks for gas bills, etc, you don't really know if you'll have to cut out stuff to have the car.  For some people the answer may be "the car is most important," so, if that's you, go ahead."
cars,"Costco gas will always be inferior to actual gas companies. Costco barely makes amy money off of gas to be bothered to improve its quality...especially considered the rate at which it is bought.   Corporate Costco employee here and that's completely wrong.  Costco gas is sourced straight from major refiners.  The price is low because Costco caps its markup on  all  products that are sold.  The same principle is followed on everything from hot dogs, jeans, appliances, gas, etc...  But your comment about barely making any money off gas is partially true for two reasons: the capped markup and the fact that Costco gas exists almost solely as an added benefit to its members and to attract potential members."

cars,"Safety equipment only works if you use the whole system together.  If you grab a climbing harness and tie into the wrong kind of rope, you're going to have a bad time.  By the same token, a harness is supposed to be used with a racing seat designed for harnesses, and a cage.   You can't make it too far back or it won't actually do anything in a rollover. You can, and should, pad the bar but that doesn't really do much good against your bare head.  The bar you install will need a harness bar, or your harness is going to be mounted incorrectly and will either be useless, or break your back.  If there aren't points on the seat to thread the shoulder straps through, they're just going to slip off in the event of a crash, and a 4 point harness allows your body to submarine under the lap belt which is pretty bad for your life expectancy.  There are a lot of track organizations that don't allow them.   As a side note, the bar will be bad for your rear visibility in your day to day driving.   And again, driving to the event is much more dangerous than driving  at  the event.  You're at low speed, on a closed course, surrounded by people with flags and radios and fire extinguishers.  You have to try pretty hard to do anything that would require a roll bar at an autox event.  A CG lock will keep you stuck in your seat for better control, and is cheaper, safer, and easier to use.

cars,"Someone else had a similar problem as you did not too long ago.](   It sounds like a bait and switch, but what you should do is see if the contract says whether or not they can rescind your contract if you cant qualify for the loan. This is something called "spot delivery". They're letting you take the car before your financing is complete. If your credit isn't good enough to qualify, they can take the car back and charge you for the mileage. The laws on this vary state by state. Some allow it, some dont. some give specific recourse to the buyer should the dealer fail to find financing for you. What i'd advise you to do is contact a consumer fraud attorney who specializes in automobiles and ask them on how to proceed. EDIT: OP you should ask the dealership to provide you what the problem with your contract is in WRITING. Then take that along with your copy of the contract and financing agreement to an attorney."
cars,"You're pretty much going to get fucked.   No matter what-unless it's in a parking lot-always always always get the police involved. You can file a report now if you want to, but that guy can simply lie and say it never happened.   Even if you had called the police you would probably still get fucked in the ass.   I have comprehensive coverage and uninsured motorist coverage and had to work hard just to get back enough to get another car. Some jackass with no insurance hit my first car when I was inside school eating lunch (high school a few years ago) and I had to go outside because the police were at my car since someone hit it. I naievely assumed that this was vaguely a good thing, since the police were already there and everything and the accident obviously was of no fault of my own as I wasn't even in the car. I assumed a person lightly tapped my bumper (natural assumption as it was parked 20ft away from a 3 way stop, one street being a one way) and someone was just following proper procedure. Instead I get out there and the shittiest Ranger I've ever seen is being pulled out of the utterly destroyed rear end of my  05 Taurus. Turns out that this guy doesn't have insurance and called a tow truck and tried to bribe the guy into towing his car in away without cops involved. Both the tow truck guy and the roofers working on a house on the street called the police though. The cop comes right up to me and asks for my information, which I fished out of the car, and then says, "Son I'm sorry but this guy doesn't have insurance. You're not going to have a car for a while" and he was fucking right. This asshole that hit me also tried to make the case that I was illegally parked, noting that my car was blocking a driveway, so it's not his fault. The cop just points at the ground where my fucking tire marks START 7 feet behind where my car now was and says "he was legal before you hit him"   So 2 weeks later my insurance finally processes my claim and wants to give me their assessed value of my car. Now, I bought my 05 Taurus with 70k on it for $3500. This is because the manager at the dealer is a close family friend, and they gave it to us at cost. At the time the car was valued at 7k and listed for 8. My insurance wanted to give me $3k because that's what I paid for it minus wear. I owned this car for 25 days before it got totaled. I did not take $500 of value off the car yet. So my mom got involved. She said, "if you can get me a comparable car for that amount then we'll take it, if not we need more than that." So another 3 weeks later I get a check for 6k. I lucked out, but I had to fight for it and go without a car for a while. And 6k becomes not 6k when you still have to pay the 1k deductible, and deal with the $30/mo insurance increase that happens when you're a 16 yo who gets his car totaled to, again, no fault of his own.   The guy who hit my car? Was never required to pay me jack shit by the state. Got fined $500 and that's it. I was essentially punished for having insurance and he was rewarded for not. My insurance company sued him and lost."
cars,"Hi there. 20 year old male valet attendant here. I worked for the same company here in Denver last summer when I was home from school, and they hired me again this summer to work at the same location.   The location I work at is a valet for 2 hotels and 6 restaurants (and a place called World of Beer). We have a parking garage on the complex with very limited parking given that there are 2 hotels and 6 restaurants. We have ~40 parking spots total that are reserved as valet only parking spots in the garage from an hour before we open until an hour after we close. We additionally have 6-7 spots right up top where we operate that we reserve for the very nice cars that come in, or if we're ridiculously busy and need somewhere to put a couple of the cars briefly to keep traffic moving.  The garage is also a single level, below ground, with minimal parking available outside the garage as well. I'd estimate there's less than 350 spots total for the complex, and sometimes people are forced to valet as we can and do run out of parking spots that aren't reserved for the valet. We do also have an overflow garage that is about 0.2 miles away from our main garage where we have more room than we'll ever fill.   Now, let's talk about the kinds of cars we get on a regular basis. The most common manufacturers are Mercedes, Audi, and BMW. Not just the entry level cars either. Sure, we get our fair share of C classes, A4s, and 3 series, but we probably get just as many of the more expensive models as well. We do occasionally get some exotics, although it's certainly not like we're operating at a 5 star luxury hotel in Miami or Vegas where multiple exotics show up daily. We've gotten Maseratis (I myself parked a Maserati Coupe from the early 2000s last summer), Porsches (rather common actually, I've parked my fair share of 911s including Turbos), the  occasional  Ferrari, and also top of the line luxury cars like M line BMWs (i.e. $100k+ M5/M6), AMG Mercedes models, and S line Audis.   As a note, when I was hired last summer, I was hired as part of the group of people hired to be the valet staff as it was a brand new development. Since last summer, there has been a total of 1, that's right  one , claim. 24 of our 40 spots in the garage are tandem parking spots and are the largest in the garage (so we have 12 tandem spots making space for 24 vehicles). We always park cars in tandem last to avoid having to move one car to retrieve another. It just adds room for error. Unfortunately, it can't always be avoided. Generally speaking, when someone has to move a tandem parked cars, it's busy enough that the valet retrieving the car blocked in moves both. The single claim at the location was a result of this happening. A large truck was moved in order to get a vehicle blocked in out. Unfortunately, the attendant was rushing while it was busy, and the truck ended up in reverse instead of park, so it ended up slowly rolling into a pole in the garage. It was a simple mistake. Shit happens.   Now, keep in mind, we operate 5 days/week (Tue-Sat) year round. This past Friday was decently busy for us with 90 cars parking over the course of the night (with 4 people working). A slow night might be 20-30 cars, with average being around 50-60. Some nights will be slow, some oddly busy, and some just average. If we take a conservative average of 30 cars/night over the last year, That amounts to 7800 vehicles we've parked. Bump that average to 40 cars (more realistic), and you're over 10,000 cars total.   So, of all the cars we've parked (ranging anywhere from 6,000 or so to 10,000+), exactly 1 has had a claim.   So, what's my point in all this? Well, it's simple really. Valets aren't the joy-riding, immature knuckleheads everyone seems to think they are.   So, how do you avoid valets like the one mentioned? Well, here are what I would call my "rules" for choosing whether or not to valet your car.     Know where your car is being parked. Do they have any spots where you'll be able to see your car while you're at your restaurant or wherever it happens to be? Yes? Great. Tip them when you show up, and ask to have your car kept visible if appropriate. No? Ask. We're happy to answer any questions you have. Are there cameras? Don't know? Ask. If someone shows up and tips us $10, we keep their car up top. Plain and simple. Keep in mind, we offer complimentary valet as well. Someone tipping us when they show up is incentive to keep their car up top. These people almost always tip on the way out too if they tip say $5 upon arrival. People that tip $10+ sometimes still tip, although that's considered a very good tip for us so we treat you just as well as you treat us.   USE COMMON SENSE. Do they valet attendants have visible tattoos or piercings? Are they well groomed? Do they wear a uniform? No? Then don't trust them with your car. The company I work for requires you to be in uniform at all times, does not allow visible tattoos or piercings (except for ears), and requires men to be clean shaven and well groomed.   Ask about their liability. Where I work, we're responsible for your car when it's under our care. The rules are simple and straightforward. We mark any visible damage to your car upon arrival. It gets parked, windows rolled up, convertible top put up if applicable, and locked. We also have cameras all over our garage, so if something happens to your car, it will be recorded. Make sure to check your car for any damage before leaving. Once you leave the property in your car, we're no longer liable, and not because we're trying to get out of damaging your car. People could leave, somehow damage their car, then come back and try to blame it on us.   Consider the alternative. Don't trust the area? Do spots seem really tight? Does it seem likely someone might open their door into yours and give you a nice dent/scratch? Generally speaking, the valet is responsible for your car as soon as you hand over the keys. We're extremely careful not to hit another car when opening the door. Our spots are also isolated from the non-valet spots, so there's no risk of someone parking next to one of our cars and damaging it unless their completely stupid and manage to hit a parked car.     Sincerely,   A hard working valet who hates stereotypes."

If you can afford a $90k car I assume you have some basic levels of luxury. The Viper is loud and fast but not terribly comfortable and doesn't have the best ride quality. Oh and the older ones aren't the safest cars either... No ABS, traction control, stability control, or roof (in the first gen)? Believe me I would love to have one but I couldn't daily drive it (especially because of weather, raining nonstop fall until winter and then snow until spring and then torrential downpours for a month...)   Also the fact that every time there is one in traffic people just stop and stare and take picture, I would get annoyed with that real quick."
cars,"It doesn't quite count as I didn't actually run out, but when I was in Canada back in 2011, driving from Glacier NP in Montana to Vancouver BC, I came about as close as I've ever been.   For some reason, my US debit card worked fine when getting a full tank of gas right after crossing the border into Alberta, but a day later when I was about just past Osoyoos I pulled in to get some gas, the machine said to see attendant. They told me my card was declined and that I'd have to call my bank. I got ahold of them, and they said that my card was fraud alerted and that they couldn't make reactivate my card until I went to a branch and showed my ID (my bank is actually Canadian).   The nearest branch was in Hope, BC on the other side of Three Brothers Mountain and I was huffing fumes with a flat-six. I used all of my Canadian and U.S. currency and coin to get about 1/2 of a tank and hypermiled through mountain passes, using 6th gear at 30 mph and cutting the ignition off on downhills. It still wasn't enough, BC is looong.   Nearing the end of my rope, fully into E with more uphill coming, I pulled into a country store / gas station to stop and consider my options. A Canadian dude pulled on Ducati and said "Nice Porsche" and I told him sheepishly that I was nearly out of fuel had zero cash left, and my damned card wasn't working with no hope of making myself whole again until I got to Hope, about 90 km away. He was really troubled and reached into his pocket, pulled out his billfold, and gave me $20 Canadian. I really couldn't refuse the help and offered to repay him in Vancouver or to Paypal him, but he wouldn't let me. I made it to Hope, got a fistful of cash and got the fraud alert taken off of my card and continued on my cross-country odyssey. There's no telling how long I was going to be stuck up on the wrong side of that mountain if I hadn't come across such a generous biker."
cars,"Last month my friend and I were driving to Chicago from the Quad Cities to look at a 350z he wanted to buy because he sold his jeep and wanted a car. So the plan was to drive his uncles 98 ranger he had been borrowing to chicago, buy the car, and I drive the ranger back home while he drives the car. Simple right?   So the next morning I wake up and get dressed for the day and he calls me and says "Dude the truck is dead. Can you come over and jump it?"   So I went over to try and jump it. It's only a few degrees above zero (Fahrenheit) this morning and this is not how you want to start your day off when you have a long day ahead. He has his uncles cables with the truck because the truck is known for dying because the battery hasn't been replaced in forever. We hook up the cables and try to jump it. Nothin. Turns over a few times and dies. Check connection. Let charge for a few minutes. Try again. This went on for about 30 minutes before we gave up and went to my house to try and use different cables. Which worked on the second try.   Finally. Now that the truck is started we can get on with it. I go back to my house to drop off my car while he goes to the bank. He picks me up and we're off. He drives quite fast all the way to Chicago (actually Elgin, Illinois) and eventually is slowed down because the wind is really picking up and blowing snow across the freeway. We continue on and the wind just keeps getting worse and worse. We pull off the freeway onto a 2 lane highway that goes to our destination. And... it starts snowing. Like a lot. Plus steady 40mph winds. I have him pull over at a gas station so I can take a piss and we continue on again.   So we keep driving down this 2 lane highway towards Elgin for about 20 minutes and snow is just blowing freaking everywhere. We're doing a steady 45-50 mph just cruising along not taking any chances. We're about 10 minutes away from out destination and we're driving down a pretty straight section on highway doing about 50mph when someone is a Subaru Forester pulls out onto the highway from an adjacent intersection. My buddy slams on the brakes and they lock up. All the while I'm thinking "You fuckin dumbass why would you OH SHIT WE'RE GONNA-" Crunch.   Fucking T-boned the person in the Subaru doing about 45mph. Both vehicles totaled. No one hurt fortunately. We stand out in the 40mph winds and snow trying to exchange insurance info and stuff for about 45 minutes. Finally a tow truck shows up and and hauls both cars away. We take a cab to the place selling the car.   But wait, the story hasn't even got bad yet.   So here we are. 3 hours from home. It snowing lightly and the wind is insane and he's trying to buy a 350z that we get to drive 150 miles back home.   So, the car goes pretty smoothly. He buys it. And we're off again. But there's something about the car that i'm uncomfortable about. Did I mention that it has summer tires on it? No, not all seasons but real, hard compound, summer tires. Fuck.   That was a long drive. We took the interstate back home. Only took 6.5 hours (normally a 2.5 hour drive). The wind was blowing a steady 50mph with god knows how fast of gusts. It's dark, it's snowing, it's insanely windy, and we have summer tires on a rwd car and 150+ miles to drive. Let's do this.   30mph. That was MAYBE the highest speed we got going with an average speed of about 15mph. You couldn't see more than about 20-25 feet ahead of you at a good moment. Sometimes the rear end would start sliding out just from the wind blowing so hard. Did I mention my buddy isn't the best driver? It was a goddamn nightmare.   We left home around 10am. Got home about 11pm. How we didn't wreck on the way home was a damn miracle in itself.   Also, when I got in the truck when he first picked me up I noticed the passenger side airbag wasn't on (it was one of those single cab rangers with the off/on airbag option.) so asked if he could turn it on but that would mean turning the truck off to use the key. Which we both agreed was a bad idea because it might not start again.   edit: I thought it was noteworthy to mention that ranger only had 65k miles. She had so much more life left.."
cars,"Alright so about a decade ago I was driving a 1991 Eclipse. It had some basic mods and made around 400whp. I was used an LM-1 Wideband if anyone remembers the big handheld unit. Well, I was in a Pop Boys parking hanging out with my fellow ricers when a supercharged CRX wanted to race.  The problem is I had been drinking and a friend of mine was driving me in my car. He said he could handle it no problem so I thought FANTASTIC let's do this. After talking with the CRX owner we settled on terms and decided to make a run. I hop in the passenger seat, my buddy gets in the driver seat and starts it up. I was as giddy as a school girl because I had never raced with someone driving my car.  As soon as the car starts I smell smoke. Drunk me doesn't think much of it. That's when I noticed the passenger side carpet was on fire. The LM-1 unit I had, had managed to get a cut in the wire. It managed to start a small fire. This is right when I noticed smoke coming from the engine bay. So he shut it off we jumped out, popped the hood, and I started trying to put the fire out with my shirt and a bottle of water. Thankfully, I got it all out.   The fire had traced itself into the engine bay follow all of my gauge wiring. So my boost gauge, oil pressure gauge, wideband, and IIRC EGT gauge were all fucked. Nothing worked. I didn't see any other damage besides my ruined shirt. So, I disconnected everything burnt and decided to race anyways. Well after 30 minutes we lined up and he lost by a couple bus lengths."
cars,"This happened a few days years ago... I was driving home from school and it started to drizzle a bit, it wasn't horrible, just a little sprinkle. Mind you i was driving a 1995 Toyota corolla with all season tires on. When i got to an intersection where i had to turn right, I slowed down to make the turn, mind you i was going ~15 mph during the turn. All of a sudden my back end kicks out and im sliding. Im at full opposite lock trying get control of my car again when i finally manage to get grip. It wouldn't have been so bad if it didn't happen right in front of a cop and within inches of his door. Needless to say i was pulled over a few seconds later. The cop said he never saw anyone else try to drift that intersection, especially when one was right there. He told me that it wad pretty coll and never to do that again before i could get the shit out if my pants and tell him it was unintentional. I later went to my work and saw him again and we traded car stories."
cars,"So I used to drive a 1999 Ford Ranger. I put that truck through some shit but it still runs really well other than burning some oil.   So one day I get a call from my buddy who wants to hang out. I let him know I had to change my oil and I would be right over.   I finished changing the oil, pulled the stick to check the oil level and all was good. I headed off to my friends house and was about a couple miles away when my brakes started acting funny. I had to compress them almost all the way to the floor to get the truck to stop. Of course I just play it off as the truck having another small issue that I will have to fix later.   I pull up to a light a couple blocks away from my friends house and notice smoke coming from under my hood. My brakes are hardly working at this point and I know something is wrong. I say fuck it anyway because I am almost there.   I pull up at my friends house with my brakes barely working and smoke billowing from under the hood. I jump out and pop the hood to a huge fire! I am freaking out at this point because, being a teenager my freedom to go where I want and vehicle to get to work, is on fire! I run to my friends house and bang on his door several times. Of course the fuckers selective hearing acts up and he doesn't hear a damn thing.   I run back to my beautiful truck that is on fire and rip my shirt off. I was able to beat the fire out but I completely ruined my shirt.   I come to find that the dumb ass who changed the oil, that would be me, left the dipstick out and it had slid in between my battery terminals and my battery had melted itself and caught fire. The stick was also laying across my brake lines which were red hot. That was probably why my brakes weren't working.   So I climb in my friends car, who finally decided to answer the door, and we went to Walmart to replace my battery. I show up at the Walmart auto department shirtless holding a battery that is nearly disintegrated and ask for a new one. The look on the guys face was beyond priceless.   I bought myself a new shirt while I was there and we headed back to his place. I installed the battery and she started right up. Luckily the fire didn't really burn anything but the battery and after it had cooled the brakes worked just fine."
cars,"Rollin' down the street and the car stalled.   That's odd, I shouldn't be out of gas.   Coasted into a parking lot and popped the hood. Entire top of the engine was in flames.   Ran to the gas station, borrowed their fire extinguisher and put it out. 5-10 minutes later the fire department showed up. Had it towed home, replaced all kinds of shit (carb, distro, lots of wires, etc) and got it running again."
cars,"I was driving home from school one day when I was 17, drove some shitty 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I got on the highway and was driving like 10 over the speed limit when some bro in his charger comes up on me like a bat out of hell and starts riding my ass.   Naturally, being some cocky kid, I proceeded to break check him and slowed down to like 35 in a 70. He couldn't get around me because of traffic so I assume he just started fumming. Anyway, a mile or two down the road and he finally has an oppening to pass me. I figured he would flip me off and be on his way.   NOPE!   This mother fucker passes me and proceeds to slam on his breaks and come to a full stop on the highway. Gets out of his car with a baseball bat and approaches my car, his girl gets out and starts calling after him (I can only guess to get him to stop).   Anyway, I didn't let him get close, I just backed up and turned around to go the other direction. Maybe threw in a little bird action as I was leaving lol."
cars,"Just happened to me. Wednesday 2/18, I was on my way to work in my Audi. As I pulled away from a stoplight, I had catastrophic transmission failure. The car would not engage any gear. I put my hazards on and drove to the shoulder, where I called and waited for roadside assistance.   I rode along in the tow truck to the shop where they said it was most definitely the transmission. The car has 265k miles on it, it's worth about $2500 and it would cost $5000+ to buy and install a new transmission. Essentially it was totalled...   I need a car for my commute, so I immediately got onto auto trader. I went through a few subarus, bmws, volkswagens, and eventually Mazdas. I found a Mazdaspeed3 with only 61k miles for sale for a shade over $10,000.   I called the 'dealer' to find out that the 'dealer' in this case is actually a startup focused on helping private parties sell cars. They even bring your desired vehicle to your address so you can test drive the car without ever leaving your home.   They showed me a pre-purchase inspection, full service history, as well as all the rock chips, nicks, and wear that one would expect to see on an 8 year old car. We took the car for a drive, and wow it felt like a brand new car.   I asked them to hold it for me while i applied for a car loan and arranged my own pre-purchase inspection at the local Mazda dealer. They brought the car to that dealer for me, where the inspection revealed no issues. Now, you're looking at the proud owner of a 2008  Mazdaspeed3."
cars,"I've owned nothing but manuals. Yes, autos are ok. Think of it like this: you're playing a video game. You decide you want your character to move in a specific manner. Sometimes, he does it right away, but most of the time he does it in a few seconds, not in any sort of truly predictable way. Maybe you can find some tricks to force him to do it when you want him to, but it still takes time. That's driving a traditional auto. A dual clutch will still do whatever it wants, but in far less time. Now imagine that your character moves immediately, as soon as you push the button he does it. You can start predicting what you'll need to do based on your environment, and will be able to seamlessly transition over obstacles as though you are the character in the game. There will be rewarding times where you are flawless, getting over obstacles with ease, and times where you might stumble a bit, but the character always does what you tell him to do at the exact.moment you tell him to. That's what it's like to drive a manual."
cars,"I feel more connected to the car with a manual. It's more of an experience, it makes the car feel like my own personal gundam! It's very exciting (if you don't know what a gundam is, google it)   Also, my first car was a manual. The car after that, an automatic, now I'm back in a manual.   I found that with an automatic I am a MUCH more dangerous driver. I was so bored driving an automatic that I constantly checked my phone and was driving distracted! Now that I'm back in a manual I hardly touch my phone and only focus on driving."
cars,"That's about right for the EJ25 WRXs.   When the EJ20 WRX first hit the US in 2000 with 230BHP it was pretty much in a class of its own for a couple of years. The only thing that touched it in HP/$ was the SRT-4 that debuted at 215BHP in 2003 and got bumped to 230 for 2004.   In Mazdaspeed terms, the MSP of the same vintage was putting down around 170BHP and they were notorious for having connecting rods that would snap like toothpicks if you put much more than factory boost through them. Saw many photos of those blocks with holes you could put your first through to the firewall."
cars,"Typically paper filters work best in terms of actual cleaning ability. Also, the stock airbox provides some sort of measure in reducing the dust and particulate matter from getting to the filter in the first place.   Personally, I wouldn't run a CAI with a cone filter on a car that's going to see a lot of dusty roads. Especially if it's an ACTUAL CAI and has the filter located down towards the bottom of the car, open to the elements. There are 2 reasons for this: first, most oiled element filters simply don't filter as well as a paper filter does. Second, if you're running it on dusty roads, it will most likely quickly clog with dirt and dust and lower your performance. If it's just a filter on a stick that sits in the engine bay, it's probably doing you no good anyway (hot air intake). Most of the VW airboxes in the MK4s and up are good for quite a bit of horsepower, regardless, so CAIs, especially on forced induction cars, do basically nothing as the air is heated up by being compressed anyway."
islam,"Oh, I meant the word 'had' as in:   In order to disbelieve in Islam, I had to find something... etc. Not I "had" to find something or else... etc.   So had meant "in order to" disbelieve in Islam, not only would something have to convince me it wasn't true, but also overcome years of teaching and indoctrination.   I'm going to copy and paste my story from the  /r/exmuslim  thread on [why I left Islam.](   I was raised as a good Muslim. I live in the US and went to an Islamic school until the 8th grade.   Looking back, the first thing that set me on my path was the death of my mother in grade 5. I was completely flabbergasted and previously had no experience of death, certainly this could not happen in a good muslim family.   Ironically, this made turn towards religion more, but in a weirdly hollow way. I never remember being sincere in any of my daily prayers and I often wouldn't even say anything, but move my lips in pretend. I also memorized much of the Quran.   Despite my non-sincerity, my beliefs were that of a fundamentalist, creationist, misogynistic muslim. I remember reading a kids book by Harurn Yahya which 'disproves' evolution by comparing evolution to a tornado assembling a 747. I was in 10th grade and believed it hook, line, and sinker. I even asked my 10th grade biology teacher why we were learning evolution when it was so obvious it was false. I remember giving me this sad look and she just said that all the data support it which we'll see later in the semester.   At that point I had opened up a bit from my extremely sheltered life (never had a sleep over, only went to friends house during eid, never left the house on the weekend except with famliy, never even knew anyone non muslim really, etc) and realized not only how different I was from everyone else, but how much that prevented me from being a normal person.   Since I was already non-sincere in my belief (I still don't know why, but often times I would get really depressed thinking about hell and promising myself to pray double prayers for the next 5 years to make up for my missed prayers), when I met an atheist for the first time it was a complete shock. I was in the 12th grade and I did not realize that there were atheists in the world. I mean, I knew there were christmas only christians and others who didn't take faith seriously, but wasn't even able to comprehend the notion of atheism at first.   It was slowly starting to make sense to me and I began asking myself questions: "Am I an atheist?". But I quickly answered 'no', since I did believe in God with my odd not sincere but also sincerely scared of hell belief system. I started reading almost anything I could get my hands on online. Not stuff debunking Islam, but I joined a forum where many people were non-religious (though their main topic was something else, not religion, however it often came up), so I began exposing myself to other views.   When I started college (though still living with my parents in my sheltered life) a took a course on basic christian theology, basic philosohpy, and a more advanced course on gender and society.   Bam, so much knowledge dropped on me at once really shifted my views. I didn't renounce Islam, but was shocked at how easy it was to refute Christianity from an academic point (in the sense the the early sources are complete shit compared to the story of the Quran's compilation). The information I received in the gender course pushed me firmly away from misogyny and into the feminist camp. I still considered myself a Muslim.   My second year at University, I took a course on Jerusalem and the three Abrahamic faiths. Again, I was surprised at how easy it was to trace the evolution of Judaism in response to major events. I asked my professor point blank: "If we can so easily see that these religions change significantly over time in reaction to human events, why still believe the religions are true?" He said that just because they change doens't me there still ins't truth in them.   I was disappointed when I found out we would not be doing any similar exegesis on the Quran (as it barely exists academically). So using what I learned from Judaic and Christian exegesis, I compared the story of the compilation of the Quran to the compilation of the Torah and the Gospel. While the official version of the story according to Muslims was better than the Judeo-Christian accounts, I could still see the same problems: lack of original source material, distance between writers and events, etc. But was really cinched it for me was the rescission of Uthman. I had read enough Orwell to know what that meant despite Muslim's best attempts to spin it.   And that was that, I could no longer believe Islam (its atrocious record on gender issues didn't help either). This was further solidified by taking a course on the history of early Islam, especially the Shia/Sunni split and the events leading up to that. It became clear that what we call Islam today is simply the winning political party throughout history."
islam,"For the laziest,"
islam,"On the other hand beyond that it means little except inflating your sense of self worth and acting as a license to give opinion (as is the usual attitude among students or fresh graduates).   Degrees are simply entry permits to become slave labor. You can use them to get a foot in the door when you want a job.   > Simply having a degree in medicine doesn't make you a doctor nor does it make anyone trust you to treat them.   Try becoming a professor or head of surgery without  a  degree. Try buying a new rolls royce without any money. Try getting married while being homeless.   Society judges people based on possessions. The more you have the more doors open for you.   Yes it's true that having the "decorations"  of this world doesn't make you a better person, but that's how society judges people.   >"
islam,"I like the idea of the question but I'm opposed to the attitude towards higher education you convey.   I believe in the utter necessity of degrees because that piece of paper saying you've done x amount of study in y field from an accredited institution is necessary. You will routinely see me demanding to know this or that alleged authority's academic qualifications for example. But that's due to the deplorable aspect of human nature by which we deceive each other.   On the other hand beyond that it means little except inflating your sense of self worth and acting as a license to give opinion (as is the usual attitude among students or fresh graduates).   Simply having a degree in medicine doesn't make you a doctor nor does it make anyone trust you to treat them. Your opinion might be taken but it won't challenge the opinion of an experienced person who can also be trusted for treating and managing a patient's care. The difference? The post-degree apprenticeship (internship, residency, etc). Though this is done very rigorously in medicine (lengthy licensing process for obvious reasons), this has a rough equivalent in every field. In the academic fields it generally refers to the number of useful works you've written/published and the reputation you earn therefrom.   What use are fresh graduates' opinions? When they're not opinions... because they're easier to ask questions of than a reference work (changing due to the internet though the human can at least attempt to explain it in layperson's language)."
islam,"I personally am of the opinion that since Christianity already asserted that Jesus was born of a virgin, that Muslims interpreted the scripture describing the birth of Jesus in the same manner. But technically, according to the verses, when Mary was visited by the messenger, she asserted that she was virgin and chaste. The messenger tells her "don't worry about it, if Allah wants it to happen, it'll happen" (I'm paraphrasing, of course :P). There is nothing that mentions that she was  still  in that state of chastity by the time the birth actually happened. Yes, she was a virgin... right up until it was time for making a baby.   So here's my take (gonna soo get told I'm blaspheming here or something but whatevs): Mary was a chaste and godly woman. There is no way she'd have relations outside of marriage. However, Allah wanted her to have the child. So he told her ahead of time... look, there's going to be a child coming pretty soon. You're having it. She protests because she is not married or unchaste - everything she's been told tells her that this can't happen without her committing some grievous sin. She's basically being comforted and reassured that when the time comes, do not despair that you have gone against the will of God because this child IS the will of God, so do what you have to do and know that you're doing the right thing here."
islam,"This is the English translation of REVIVAL OF RELIGIOUS LEARNINGS  丕丨蹖丕亍 毓賱賵賲 丕賱丿蹖賳 You can see for yourself what Ghazali says about Mathematics."
islam,"Alright, this is not an excuse, but from a historical viewpoint, the Nobel Prize only started at the beginning of the 20th century, well into Islamic civilization's decline, followed by decades of occupation by the colonial powers and then decades more of questionable autocratic rule of Islamic lands. It is not surprising therefore that muslim lands tend to be lacking in the contributions to the sciences in modern times. Again, not an excuse, but an explanation of the Nobel Prize criticism.     On to your first question: AlGhazali was an interesting fellow and had a very interesting relationship with science and skepticism. In fact, it can be said that AlGhazali supported scientific progress in the muslim world, even encouraging avenues of research considered taboo, [such as human dissection](   AlGhazali was in fact a renowned polymath and philosopher. The reason people sometimes think he was against science is because he was very against Greek philosophy and his crowning work "The Incoherence of Philosophers" was a direct jab at Aristotlean metaphysics. He wanted, through his works, to steer Islamic philosophy away from Greco-Roman themes to more Afro-Asiatic methodology.   The basic gist of his philosophy of [occasionalism]( is that it is not scientifically correct to derive causality from even mundane events that are highly correlated. For example, bringing a cotton ball to a flame and the ball burning happen together all the time. He simply draws out this example and says that it is not correct to say the fire causes the cotton ball to light up. He says God does. God, according to AlGhazali is the cause of everything happening and the fact that he chooses to do things together makes them look correlated.   None of this contradicts observable phenomenon. AlGhazali did not say you cannot deduce scientific "facts" from the study of nature. He simply changes the framing. He didn't want to widen the schism between religion and science. He wanted to bring them together. He wanted to replace the western thoughts of "whatever I cannot understand is a mystery known only to God" with "whatever I discover is proof of the wondrous order of God".   I may be building castles in the sky here, but in my belief, had AlGhazali's ideas made it into mainstream philosophical thought, the schism between science and religion, secularism and orthodoxy would never occur as it had in Europe. In AlGhazalean philosophy, formation of galaxies, planets, abiogenesis, evolution, are all compatible with the concept of God.   It is extremely unfair for Neil deGrasse Tyson to be criticizing AlGhazali as responsible for Islamic thinking's downfall. Think about it, can any one person's philosophy change the course of an empire single handedly? Unlikely. In fact, AlGhazali was deeply criticized and many works were published refuting his work. It was science true and true.   It is true however that Islamic thought did begin its decline after the 11th century (when AlGhazali lived) but Neil should've looked at a more likely reason for this: 1095AD was the first of 7 crusades by the European powers against the Islamic Empire. A country besieged is unlikely to invest heavily in science."
islam,"Yes it's noticeable, but here are my two cents:     Many people are brainwashed by media and don't want to admit it. You do this experiment yourself, try reading news from one biased source all the time, try it for 2-3 months in row and see how your views will start to change. Now think about those people who have been hearing the same biased media their whole life.     Honestly, we (Muslims) aren't much better. Example, there are many clips on youtube now for the Sandy storm, Arabic comments are full of hate and wish all Americans die in the storm, not all comments but most of them though. This isn't what Islam teaches us."
islam,"Yeah those are both excellent points. One possible Muslim view is that everything came about the same way as atheists believe it did, except God created Adam separate from everything else as a special case.   My own view is that if you pay careful attention to the way the creation of Adam is described in the Qur'an, you find two major events, which is that 1) Adam was physically formed, and 2) God breathed His soul into Adam. So my personal belief is basically that Adam was born from non-human parents that were very much like humans, but lacked human souls or a human level of consciousness, and in a miraculous event Adam became the first human when God endowed him spiritually/mentally. After Adam, other people became human, including Eve and the spouses of Adam and Eve's children (perhaps being human can be learned). The verses saying Adam was shaped from clay is an analogy for humans' physiological development which we all share (clay meaning physical matter, Earth, as opposed to fire, what jinn are made from, and whatever it is angels are made of).   I did once listen to an Islamic scholar being asked how Adam and Eve's children found spouses, or if they were allowed to marry their siblings. The scholar basically said just as God created Adam and Eve, he was able to make other humans to accompany them. This fundamentally in agreement with what I said, and even in the Torah there is the mystery of Cain's wife, which suggests that Adam and Eve and their children were not the only people around at that time."
islam,"I am an Agnostic and I will say straight off the bat that I have not read the Koran but it is on my reading list (for fun) but I have a couple of questions for you guys.     How do guys know you picked the right religion? I am assuming must of you have parents who are Muslim, are you just following your parents footsteps. If not what made you choose Islam? I mean there are several Abrahamic religions alone then if you throw in the far east religions  there are billions of people who believe in something different then you. If your religion is the correct one how can so many people be wrong? Are the other people hearing things in their head when they think they are talking to their god? If they are talking to your god and not knowing it then why doesn't he lead them on the right path instead making them think they are worshiping another god?  How do you know that you're not the crazy one or that your mind isn't playing tricks on you, or that you aren't being brainwashed by others who have been brainwashed?     What are non extremist Muslims doing to retake their religion. I don't know if you guys have noticed but the extremists of your religion have butchered the worlds view of it. (Side question, does Islam have a Pope like equivalent? If so why have I not heard of him?)     What's the deal with Sharia Law?  Are you all for it? Is it something only the extremist want? If you are for it why? A separation of church and state has shown to reduce violence just look at Christianity and how the increase of separation between church and state has lead to a relatively less violent religion."
islam,"Makes the most sense. Others are completely wrong and aren't immediately damned to hell.    Creating books, educating their students having lecture yeah the stuff that actually works. You can't stop extremism with what created in the first place. Ignorance. It works fine in my community. Every Muslim child goes to the masjid and they see Islam. Their aren't taught the religion with bias on hating. So they grow up into productive citizens. I'm an example. I'm against conflict and don't do terrible things. What people don't realize are the insane ones are the converts who weren't taught religion they were taught politics. Isis members couldn't tell you basic Islamic information. But could recite the historical events that happened during colonialis in vivid detail. Islam teaches patience. The patience to face ignorance and rage with peace and wisdom. And the media can't sell that thus its not seen   Yeah that's a long topic."
equalityissues,"Speaking as a non-USAian I blame US teen drama TV shows. This is an oversimplification, there is a certain amount of chicken and egg going on. To my eye the ideas presented in these shows are a highly concentrated study of all that is wrong with human interactions, the quest for status, the use of other people to attain status, rigid social hierarchies and roles and at best trivial questioning of the current state of society.   I worry about my son watching such things and internalising the concepts within them, the contrast with shows produced in the UK is astonishing. There are seriously well written dramas aimed at young teenagers that cover a wide range of issues that don't feel like cookie cutter "Here is the officially sanctioned viewpoint on minority issue X.""
LiverpoolFC,"We coped with them pretty well and did compete. We just don't have the necessary quality in key areas thay they do.   We have improved our squad this summer.  It was God awful this time last year. First team still needs work.   Look how overrun our midfield, with the exception of Gerrard, was against Villa.   When the tide is going against us Lucas, Allen even Henderson seem to go missing.  Henderson is improving all the time in fairness.   These players are great when we are in control of a game or even when its 50-50. They can't handle the pressure when the tempo raises against us.....losing possession repeatedly, putting the defence under pressure again and again.   I know Lucas is a fan favourite and on his day looks really good but he does go missing, like against Villa, too often for my liking.   I hope this isn't an area BR is blind to, like Arsene and his defensive blindspot, as I think people miss how much an improvement in big games would be had from buying a better deep lying midfielder."
LiverpoolFC,"I disagree with the caveat that it would require wise reinvestment in the transfer market. Basically without Suarez you lose 30ish goals and 15 assists (based on this season). That is a lot. You also lose the intangibles, which in some sense is a bigger loss (and basically irreplaceable). But I think that we could sell Suarez and still add to the trophy chest next year.   First, Sturridge has the potential to be the best striker in the world (the only thing holding him back is decision making, really). He's not even in his prime. Just think about that.   But right now we score basically no goals from midfield (not counting Gerrard's PKs) and very few from the wings. Reinvesting the money can make up for the measurable loss of Suarez's goal contribution and (perhaps just as importantly) replace or rotate some under-performing starters (I'm looking at you, first-choice fullbacks). And (as distasteful as I find the idea) we can spend some real money getting a real replacement for Gerrard who is in or entering his prime (someone like a Vidal).   Yes, yes a complete squad replacement negatively affected Spurs (at least, initially). But we don't need that kind of overhaul. One striker (remember Borini is coming back too), one versatile mid with a goal threat, at least one full back, maybe a wide forward/winger. Plus Suso is coming back, Teixera is going to be a player, Ibe is an even surer prospect and Jordan Rossiter is a 5 star scouse hero in FM.   Of course, I'd prefer to have Suarez retire a red (we certainly deserve that based on the support he's received after literally biting an opponent). But it wouldn't be the end of the world and more importantly, it doesn't have to halt the club's momentum."
LiverpoolFC,"Financially this has plenty of potential with all the shirt sales. Realistically, do we really need him with all the midfielders that we have, especially since we just bought Henderson? If we do get him, it feels as if he'll only be here for a few years, sells lots of shirts for us in Japan, and then go off to a Spanish club."
FanTheories,"That's definitely an interesting storyline to explore, but I always thought that the end to IM3 was more thematically significant than just a plot development. His statement "I am Iron Man" shows how his character has changed and how his perception of who he is is broader than what it was in Iron Man and Iron Man 2. In the first film, Iron Man is his alter ego - it's the suit, its this 'super hero' that he has to put on. It takes him four movies to realize that, in escaping from the Ten Rings, he built himself a new prison every bit as limiting as the one he was held in. Just as his handicap became his means of escape (the arc reactor), his means of escape became his handicap itself (the Iron Man Armor). He wants to be Iron Man, at the end of the film he tells the world that he is, but he's talking about the suit - he's saying "I was the one in there, that's why I am Iron Man." He's saying that the suit makes him Iron Man. But it doesn't.   In Iron Man 2, the suit has become a parasite in more ways that one - the arc reactor is leeching his health away, the fame and attention that the suit has reignited is throwing Tony's life into chaos, the world is getting bigger and more dangerous than he can control, and the role of "Iron Man" has painted a technological and criminal target on his back. The suit is killing him, but he doesn't understand why. He thinks its just a problem to fix (which, with his father's help, he does fix the issue with the Arc Reactor), but he still feels that he needs the suit. He calls it a "high tech prosthesis," and that's exactly what it is. At the end of the movie, when Fury debriefs Stark, Natasha's reports says that Tony should not be recruited, but Iron Man should be. This shocks Stark, because he doesn't think of himself separately from the suit. The suit is him, that's why he's Iron Man, right?   The Avengers hints at this as well, in the exchange between Stark and Captain America. Steve says "Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?" Tony give a snappy reply, but doesn't really even seriously consider that question before now. Think back to Iron Man 1 - the slideshow that is shown before Rhodey presents Tony's award to Obediah. This montage of Tony's accomplishments and abilities is like the introduction to a super hero. We were shown how extraordinary Tony is before the suit is even a thought in his mind.   When Iron Man 3 comes out, we see Tony more dependent on the suit than ever before. It has literally become a prosthesis, he depends on it for security. He develops panic attacks after the battle of New York, and we really see how dependent he has become in two seemingly small scenes that are some of the smartest in the movie: first, when he bolts out of dinner with Rhodey and has to get into the suit because of his panic attack. He literally needed the suit to feel like he wouldn't die. Second, the scene where he is driving and the kid tells him that the suit doesn't seem to be charging. He slams the breaks, and this news alone is almost enough to send him into another panic attack. Until the kid tells him to build something. He spends a lot of the rest of the movie without the suit, relying only on his own ingenuity and determination to carry him through.   At the end of Iron Man 3, says that the truth is "I am Iron Man." But he also says that he realizes now that the suit was a cocoon, it was a crutch. It didn't make him Iron Man, it actually held him back from realizing that he was  always  Iron Man. Extremis would be cool, but it seems to me that the clear theme being developed is that the suit doesn't make him Iron Man, he makes himself Iron Man. He created the suit, but then became obsessed with it, dependent on it. It was a parasite that drained his ingenuity and innovation. He had to destroy all his suits and start over, because now he's been reforged and realizes that he is the hero. He doesn't think of himself as having an alter-ego anymore, he knows that he has always been Iron Man, he just needed the right stimulus to develop into the persona.   I feel like having it just be a nod to a new suit that is part of him would be taking a step backwards from that. It may be the case that he gets Extremis armor, but it would be even more interesting to see what he can come up with now that he no longer even feels hindered by the concept of armor, no longer feels like just a man in a suit. He's back to where he started - an inventor, the man who we saw the slideshow of accomplishments for - but with a new focus. What wonders will this Iron Man be able to accomplish now that he isn't just tinkering with Mark 43? Now that he is free from captivity, free from the prison that he made for himself when he escaped from the Ten Rings. Now that the limits of the Iron Man suit are gone, and its just Tony, just the persona of this mechanic. What can he accomplish?"
FanTheories,"He does try to engineer around that though. In Captain America 2 he redesigns the Hellecarriers. I seriously doubt that it was only the propulsion system he re-engineered i suspect he tried to fix a lot more than that. In the final scene when the carriers are starting to crash they take ages. In Avengers it takes all of 2 seconds for them to fall several hundred feet, with 3 engines online. Three are out on  the IN-3 Carrier and it takes about the same time."
Physics,"Research!!! Getting an  enthusiastic  research professor is the key to everything, I think. He started me on this project the semester before I had even started QM A, and basically taught me all the physics I needed to know himself (QM and Mech II and Numerical Analysis were a breeze afterwords!). I have a working knowledge of some aspects of QFT and Many-Body soley through him, and I now see why research is so important-- you learn more than you can imagine while working on an interesting problem of your own  with  your professor. I'm having a blast!"
Physics,"If you've gotten D's and C's (even up to B-'s) in your physics classes, that indicates that you didn't really learn the material. Grad schools do want to know that their incoming students have a good knowledge of basic physics, and while research experience, especially if you have a publication, can make up for a slight deficiency in grades, say if you got B's in a few classes, honestly I don't think it will be enough for people to overlook your C's and D's.   If you want to get into grad school (the stepping stone to a career in theoretical physics), my hunch is that you will need some way to show that despite doing badly in your physics classes, you have learned the physics anyway. Obviously, that starts with going back and studying the material from the classes you got low grades in, doing practice problems and whatever so that you really learn it. I'm not sure if you have time for this before graduating, but then again you could delay applying to grad schools for a year after you graduate. Then you will need some way of proving that you've learned the physics. The only thing that comes to mind is getting a good physics GRE score, accompanied with recommendation letters from professors who can vouch for the fact that you have learned the physics from your classes after not doing well in the classes."
CrusaderKings,"The most memorable one I have is when I did it in the LP I was doing for CK2, coincidentally this is my favourite playthrough I've done because of all the twists and turns.   Beware the massive wall of text all ye who enter   Started out as a ruler designed Count William d'Harcourt of Mortain, Willie (the Bastard) won his war so we were technically part of England now. Fabricated a few claims on the neighbours and for the next generation or so just focussed on doing that, upgrading holdings and avoiding old William's attempts to assassinate me the bastard   My second ruler got lucky when we were snapping up bits of Brittany and got a claim on the duchy, meaning of course we would be independent from Normandy and directly serving the King. Won that war handily, but we had medium crown authority to contend with, I couldn't simply fight for Normandy. So, while the King was away on Crusade we struck, Duke Nathaniel managing even in his mid 60's to lead troops into battle to demand we be allowed to govern under low crown authority. He dies just before the end of the civil war, leaving his young son of 12, also named Nathaniel   Duke Nathaniel II reigns from the age of 12 to the grand old age of 77, in his lifetime adding much of Flanders, Valois and Munster (inherited a claim through his mother) to the realm. Some nobles in France due to their elective succession laws declare a war for his claim to the throne but it is unsuccessful. He gains the nickname the old, and when he finally dies, his eldest son Brian comes to the throne at 54   Brian I dies to the assassination attempt of  his  son's wife a mere few months into his rule, having accomplished nothing really of note except keeping the ducal throne warm. His son Brian II has the trait depressed, and offs himself soon after his son turns 16, also having accomplished nothing of note.   Brian III, or Brian the Great as he comes to be known assumes the throne at 16 and immediately begins kicking ass and taking names. Venice has gone Fratecelli and blobbed out in Sicily and the Pope calls a Crusade against them, Brian missing out on being the winner of the lot by a mere few percentage points. A Scots bastard gets it instead and our family begins a vendetta against him (suffice to say he and his family get wiped out). We win a war for freedom from the tyranny of England and maintain an independent state in northern France and Flanders. Venice is added to the realm soon enough and a distant cousin manages to be elected King of France, with Brian as his heir, which means Brian uses his immense power to prop this relative up and keep him on the French throne. Sadly though at age 40 Brian dies a natural death after a period of illness.   His son Nigel continues where Brian began, propping up his distant cousin King Serlo. Growing tired of constantly having to save this guy's bacon, Nigel offs him once he's confirmed as heir to the Kingdom. King Nigel I d'Harcourt hands out the various duchies he has and immediately crusades for Sicily, winning it easily enough given he has 60,000 swords to his name. With Sicily secure and most of Francia also secure we began nibbling at the HRE when it went into rebellion and finally, at long last in 1243 we have an imperial crown.   Later we go on to inherit a claim on England which we push in an invasion, eventually forming Ireland from the remnants we hold and battling Scotland into submission. Galicia, Portugal and Africa are added to the fold and Britannia formed before a lucky set of circumstances means we can crusade for Jerusalem and add that to the collection. A strong Golden Horde that has blobbed it's way across all Eastern Europe and has torn the Holy Roman Empire asunder doesn't make things any easier as the d'Harcourt's are now the defenders of the west, a role we step into grudgingly at best seeing as the Golden Horde can call around 500,000 men to arms against our around 200,000   Uniting all of Sicily in the mid 1340's under Emperor Simon I we're presented with an interesting scenario: Byzantium has switched to elective, and we're second in line after a child Emperor and his brother. In much the same way as we first inherited France, we murder them both and sit with the crown of Eastern Rome upon our heads, and most of the lands required to reform Rome proper in our control or close enough that we can holy war it. Not bad for a Count from an unknown house, though in true Norman tradition we followed in the steps of Robert Guiscard to obtain our realms and keep them. He'd have been proud. The Golden Horde invades for Jerusalem and shortly after we beat the bejesus out of them it breaks into rebellion which so far doesn't look like it's going to stop. We're nabbing up required bits of their land and the rebelling Balkans for the funsies now really with less than 100 years to go in game."
CrusaderKings,"Things are going pretty well nowadays.](   Duing a rather weak period (they had around 5-7k troops due to low crown authority!) I managed to seize their holdings in Khiva, the Sultan of Africa successfully revolted and broke off and even though the Abbasids managed to gain Portugal in a Jihad a Crusade led by the (now Catholic) Africa conquered Jerusalem.   Then a Shia event happened along with a host to de-throne the Caliph - the formed had 177k troops the latter 32k (same as the Caliph at the time). The Shia took Anatolia from the Abbasids and a bit later conquered Jerusalem from the Sultan of Africa, nicely settling in between the two strongest powers (with still 77k troops remaining); the host managed to de-throne the former Caliph and put in someone (still Abbasid) who most of their subjects hate.   Nowadays there are factions forming constantly and a revolt just started to lower crown authority for the new Caliph.   The Zun are doing just fine, in fact during my Tengri Reformation/Feudal & Ultimogeniture adaptation crisis (maybe I shouldnt've done all three at the same time!), they managed to grab a few counties from me. Now they're attacking the neighbouring Indian Kingdom. [Fun times!](   I'm also looking strong up in the North . Gave Pannonia away (to the newly formed Tengri holy order, which promptly destroyed it due to having no lands I assume?) so that my vassals don't fight and hate me and can change the succession law in peace.   Wow this turned out to be a wall of text, so"
CrusaderKings,"I may have left out that the umayyadds control all of Spain and a majority of western France. Charlemanges legacy lasted maybe two generations.

personalfinance,"the blue preferred card has a 75$ annual fee and as such I would not get it.

personalfinance,"Future advice: never get a credit card or car loan at the same place you have your checking/savings/money market accounts.   The agreement for your loans usually includes a section on the issuer's "Right to Offset." This means that if you default or go over your limit, they can take the money from your other accounts with the institution to cover the losses."
personalfinance,"I would advise that you just save you money. Make sure that when you're out of college and on your own you have a big ol pile of money to help you. You'll need all kinds of things you don't even know about right now and then if you don't have a job, you'll need them anyway and a bunch of rent money. Find a high yield savings or CD and park your cash. You will need it. If you can start your career in no debt, you will be in an excellent position moving forward. It will allow you to start saving/investing in earnest and you will make up any "lost" ground almost instantly."

How about you just open an IRA and contribute to it?  Let's skip all the borrowing money at 3% in order to fund your retirement.  Best case, you're giving away 3% of your returns, and worst case is the market crashes and you're paying 3% on something that's worth 25% of what you paid for it.

Find something in the $5k-$10k range, and get a loan from Penfed.org for 1.49% (assuming you have good credit).   > Kelly BB on old car is around 2-3k (though some places give you like 5k on the spot for trade-ins I think?)   No one will give you more than the car is worth wholesale.  If one place will give you $2k extra, that means they are charging you $2k extra on the car you're buying.  Your best bet is to sell the car directly on Craigslist, and avoid trading it into a dealer.   > I was thinking about investing in a CD, but I was advised with interest, current rates, and inflation I wouldn't really be coming out ahead much.

personalfinance,"The Subie is a great car, but there are lots of them used out there. For 10k you can get something that is reliable and will haul the kid and dog no problem. As a parent of two with a big dog I recommend a station wagon if you can swing it, sedan gas mileage with SUV space and the dog fits nicely in the back.   With the amount of cash you have on hand, you can get a  really  good used car without having to make payments. I paid less than half your number for our wagon and it has served us well. Yes used cars have more maintenance issues, but buying new doesn't guarantee anything and the money you save will pay for a AAA membership (recommended) and a thorough go-over at the mechanic with thousands to spare."

personalfinance,"most ppl would be looking to secure some real estate for their future   Indeed, that's how the successful middle class model has worked in the United States for many years. But with cost of living, lots of people in debt from student loans, and wage freezes across the country, the norm is shifting away from that. People are renting longer, getting married older, holding off on kids, etc., just because everything is unstable.   Personally, I would find a more fulfilling job before trying to find a house. If you want to buy a house just to invest in real estate, that's not the smartest move. A house you buy should be a place you want to live for a long-haul in order to build equity and make a home. Can you see yourself working at your current job for the next 5-10 years in order to live in a home you bought?   You say you're in the LA area. Are you tied to living in Cali? Could you look for work somewhere with a cheaper cost of living like Atlanta or Minneapolis? Your current salary would go a long way in suburban Chicago or Milwaukee.   With regard to the car, it all depends on how it's running. My volvo is also hitting 10 years +110,000 miles. Had a spendy brake fix a last year, but it runs well and is reliable. We expect it to go another 3-5 years easily. How much do you spend on gas and maintenance? If you got a car with better safety features, could you save on car insurance? There are a lot of ways to compute justification of buying a newer car. You could even save more money by moving close to your job and getting rid of the car. Lots of options.   Essentially, in order for you to make a decision, you have to figure out what you value. Do you value a stable job over a fulfilling career? Would you rather save for a house or buy a more reliable vehicle? Is the amount of money you save living with your family worth losing in order to start the homebuying process? All things you need to consider.   Sorry that got long, but I hope it gave you some food for thought."
personalfinance,"I think you can afford it on paper, but should look carefully at what it actually costs. Read up on the time value of money and how much money invested early (at e.g., 23) grows over your life. There are plenty of websites out there that show you stuff like that visually. I think it can he quite sobering to get a reminder that you're spending some nontrivial multiplier of older-you money of the list price on a luxury item that will be out if date in a few years."
personalfinance,"Your post isn't totally clear, but I assume option A is you earning a % of salary? So in other words, after 5yrs, you would have a final pension of 8.5% of final salary annually?   In option B, you lose 0.7% of salary / annum in exchange for a 3.5% of current salary contribution to 401k?   So the calculation you need to make is to compare 0.7% pension with the 3.5% matching contribution. Everything else (including your 5% contribution) effectively cancels out.   So lets make a few assumptions:     You work for 20yrs   Your 401(k) earns 5%/yr   Your salary grows at 2%/yr   Starting salary = $100k   EDIT: Instead of a perpetuity in retirement, I now assume 20yrs of retirement.     Value of 0.7% final salary pension:     After 20yrs, your final salary is $145,600   Your 0.7% pension = 145k x 20 x 0.7% = $20,400/yr   The value of that pot at the time of retirement =  $20,400 / 5% = $408k   $254k (PV of 20yrs of final salary payments with r = 5%)     Value of 3.5% contribution 401(k):     Same assumptions as above   Contribution in year 1 is $3.5k   Contributions thereafter grow at 2% as does salary   Investment return is 5%   Company contribution is paid at the end of each year (simplifying assumption)   This gives a total value at the time of retirement of $136k     Clearly the more final salary pension you can get, the better (this is normally the case). Playing with the values gives the following:     Adjusting the 401(k) investment return rate to 8.5% and keeping everything else equal results in the two options being pretty much the same   If the salary growth rate is greater than 2%, the final salary pension value rises rapidly, much more than the additional value you get from the higher 401(k) contributions.   If you live longer than 20yrs in retirement, the value of option A gets bigger.   Assuming you only stay with the company for 5yrs, the 401(k) grows to $21,500 and the pension is valued at almost $36,000."
personalfinance,"i'm more of a capitalistic mindset, and i do think that, while there should be simple liberties and necessities provided to all human beings, if you want something beyond what is necessary, then you must pay a premium for it.  so, to get to your list:   a)  breathable air - a basic human right and necessity.  clean air is not a consumable.  however, O2 chambers, scented air ARE consumables.   b)  drinkable water - same as above.  a basic human right and necessity.  clean potable water is not a consumable.  however, bottled water, super purified water, mineral water, sodas, drinks ARE consumables.   c)  roads and transportation - a bit of a grey area.  most nations' citizens pay for this via their taxes, which are regulated by their governments.  to pay an additional tax for a highway, is your choice.   d)  security - even more grey than public roads.  your taxes pay for your armed forces, military and police, however you do not have much direction and cannot in all respects be considered a consumable.  however, you can choose to pay extra for personal security measures.  while you are provided basic security (depending on where you live), you can consume "security".   e)  shelter - sadly, this is a consumable, even though it really shouldn't be.   f)  food - same as shelter.  basic food and sustenance shouldn't be a consumable for a nation's citizens, but it is.  the US combats this (as well as shelter) via incentivized welfare, but not everyone chooses to partake in it, and many take advantage of it.  however, if you want more or "better" food, that is up to the citizen to consume.   g) education - basic education is provided up to the high school level in the US via the public school system.  it used to be that a high school education was enough.  now, it is understood that that is not necessarily the truth, but the government subsidizes a very large portion of in-state schools through the individual states to their in-state students.  HOWEVER, it is the CHOICE of the individual to pursue an education to a out-of-state school or private school if they deem that is it more beneficial to them in some manner.  in short:  yes it is a consumable to the same degree that the others are.  a "basic" need should be supplied by the government, however not everyone needs to be provided a Harvard level education.  (although, it may or may not be better to do so)   h)  healthcare - straight up, i understand it, but i'm not a fan of obamacare.  i like the fact that in the previous system, if you wanted healthcare you could use either your own insurance to cover for better healthcare or if you couldn't afford healthcare, you could go to a hospital where they treat you with or without it.  i can talk about this forever, but i believe that basic healthcare shouldn't be a consumable, but for better care (or medicine for that matter.  what's medicine?  are vitamins and supplements considered medicine?  what about OTA drugs?), you need to pay a premium (that made me sound incredibly inhuman, however that is how i feel.  i also believe that euthanasia and suicide shouldn't be illegal, but that is just me.)"
personalfinance,"The Vanguard Target funds are a great place to start. Take a look at its holdings:     Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund - 63.0%   Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund -27.0%   Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund - 8.0%   Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund - 2.0%     Total Stock Market itself is about 72% Large and 28% Mid/Small. If you held Target 2055 and a separate S&P 500 fund in your 401k, then you'd shift that 72/28 split more towards Large and the International and Bond %'s would also drop. With a low 401k balance that shift is pretty minor, but if your 401k grows faster than your IRA then you might end up way out of balance.   Here's a a version of my allocation tracker with your potential funds, made up holdings and pretty standard asset allocation targets:   Save a copy and play with the numbers. The 401k value is controlled by overall value and the IRA funds are controlled by # of shares. You'll notice one issue with the slice and dice approach is meeting Vanguard's $3000 fund minimum, especially for bonds. You could get around this by buying the RGVGX bond fund in your 401k instead."

personalfinance,"I worked a lot of dinky little jobs during HS that paid minimum wage and the paychecks were nice, but basically useless. I didn't have any bills at the time, and still remember not being able to afford pretty much anything that I wanted. In fact, my parents weren't giving me allowance when I worked, so I think I ended up behind.   Basically it wasn't great.   In college, a friend hooked me up with a gig as a waiter at a pretty expensive restaraunt in town. I'd walk out of work everyday with around $200 in cash. When you're 19 and making that kinda money, it's pretty huge. I had thousands of dollars stacked in my drawer because I didn't have anything better to do with it.   That was pretty great.   Then I had a long stretch of schooling, where I was living off loans for a long time. I finally got my first real "adult" job a few years ago, and I remember being stoked about my first few paychecks. The novelty has kinda worn off now, though, and given all of my new adult bills, it kinda sucks, and I wish I made a lot more than I currently do."
personalfinance,"You will owe self-employment tax even though you will likely not owe any federal income tax. This is true whether or not you receive any formal "1099" documents from your clients. And it's true whether you receive cash payments "under the table" or payment by check.   Take a look at Schedule C or C-EZ to report your income and deduct business expenses, to find your business "profit."   Use that Schedule C result on Schedule SE  to compute your self-employment tax. You have to file Schedule SE if you had more than $400 in Schedule C profit.   Because you have self-employment income, you don't get to do the Form 1040-EZ. Take a look at Form 1040. On the 1040, your business profit goes on line 12, your self-employment tax goes on line 57, you can deduct half your self-employment tax on line 27.   If you are a dependent, you'll on page 2 get to deduct $6200 from your income but not get to deduct a personal exemption amount. Since your total earnings are much lower than that $6200, you would not owe any federal income tax.   However, you'll notice that the SE tax line is underneath the income tax line. It's independent of income tax."
personalfinance,"Good question - it's not for credit utilization or anything like that. But back when I got paid monthly, I would pay credit cards once a month, on payday. I got used to that - as soon as I got paid, the cards got paid off, so I never had to hold or earmark anything. Which is great - if there's $1,000 in checking, I can spend $1,000 (I use a separate account for savings, transferred to every payday also). This wouldn't work if the billing cycle closed on the 2nd or something and was due the 23rd (so the 1st wasn't in that range), but that wasn't the case, so it worked great.   So I kept that up when we moved to bi-weekly. I don't have to ever keep track of what money is about to be spent on an upcoming credit card bill. By paying (current balance in full) every 2 weeks I can completely ignore all credit card bills, due dates, closing dates, etc (all bills are electronic and auto-archived). I literally don't even know my due dates, and I follow my finances pretty darn closely.   I admit it's very weird not having to pay attention to any credit card statements (the "balance due" is always useless as by the time it's generated, I've already paid some of it), so I'd only recommend this if you really get bothered by earmarked money and have a situation where you rarely charge more than what you earn in 2 weeks (like for occasional plane tickets, I have to do a quick dip into savings, I can't wait for another paycheck to cover it)."
personalfinance,"If you've got enough savings, auto pay everything!   I try, as much as possible, to keep everything on a credit card or  ORIGINATING at my credit union . Hell no way I'm linking my bank account to some dinky bill pay through my town's water utility. This is a free service at my CU. I know my old internet company charged you a "convenience fee" for using their online payment, which is utter horse shit. They make sure the payment is sent exactly on time for electronic, or enough days early with paper checks to get around postal holidays.   So, through my credit union I can connect to accounts, like water, electric, credit card which are variable each month (or quarter). My bank reads the bill due, then sends me an email, letting me approve the payment.   For bills that aren't set up to receive electronic payments, my credit union cuts them a paper check and mails it. This was perfect for rent, and now my condo association dues.   For bills that are electronic and the same every month, mortgage, car payment, insurance, internet, just set and forget it.   For bills that you can't pay by check or electronically, (netflix, spotify, transit card, commuter pass) I link to a rewards credit card. The credit card goes into the almost-auto-pay. I get 1-3% cash back for paying those bills.   I also use YNAB, so I don't ever really need to worry about if the bill could clear or not, or when the bill hits. I've already budgeted for that bill. When it hits is irrelevant. I keep about 2 months expenses in checking at any time.   I've also got calendar reminders on my google calendar of when bills are due, but my CU reminds me too."
personalfinance,"I own 2 corporations. An LLC, and a SUB S corp.   Yes the tax laws favor corporations. I will attempt to explain.   A Sub S corp is a flow through entity. S crops do not pay taxes. My corporation provides me and my wife wife each a company car. We have to calculate our personal mileage an pay taxes on it. No big deal. The rest of the expenses including gas and maintenance are paid for by my company. When I purchased my company from the previous owner we did a private financing deal. I take distribution from the company to make the payments, I get to write off the interest. I pay tax on the principal. Remember this washes through to my personal tax return.   S corp rules I have to take an appropriate wage and pay social security, state, local, and federal taxes on it.  I do that. My LLC operates as a holding company for the real estate my business operates in. So I basically rent space to myself.  Why would I do this?  The LLC rental income is not subject to social security tax.   According to GAAP/IRS we can utilize deprecation on the building and the fixed assets of the s corp. This reduces the income that flows through to my personal return.   For my final act, my S Corp has ~10 FTE's. I offer SHOP health insurance, so my business get a tax credit.   You might remember that an S corp doesn't pay taxes - so where does the tax credit go?  Answer: it flows through on my K1 to my personal return.  What does this mean?   On $220K of income in 2014, using all maximizing all deductions and credits, I not only had a $0 federal tax obligation for the entire Year, I have a $1K tax credit carryover for 2015.

If you are financially doing well, then you should look into maximizing your 401k at $18,000 for the year. 15% contribution should be able to do that before the end of the year with your projected 22% bonus income.

I personally recommend the Vizio E-series, great quality and relatively inexpensive (50 inches looks like it's $500-600).   EDIT: don't go 3D tv, don't go 4k tv, just 1080p smart LED tv"
personalfinance,"To be very honest - the zero down loan is the single worst thing I have ever done to myself financial and I would NOT recommend that route.   My husband and I purchased a 1928 cape during the peak of the market (November 2006) and watched the market crash and burn basically 6 months after. We were sold into the 0 down, as most homes in our area were way out of our price range. Those that were near our price point, needed a ton of work.  The thinking was, go 0 down, fix it up with the money you would have used as your downpayment. In 5 years, sell it & use the profits for our next home.   We went that route with an 80/20 loan - 80% at 6.25% & 20% in a balloon loan at 14.50%. We refinanced in 2009 to a 5% loan, but added nearly $16,000 in fees to get out of the mess of loans we were sold into initially.   Fast forward to today, we can essentially sell for what we purchased for 9 years ago.  And we'll walk away with $0 if we are lucky, after all the fees.  We put $56,000 into "fixing" this place up - new kitchen, new bath, installed central air, converted from oil heat to high efficiency gas heat, new windows (originals were from 1928), new roof - you name it, it's basically been done to this house."
personalfinance,"Student aid coordinator here. Emancipation wouldn't matter at this point since OP is an adult - it has to be done before they turn 18   With that being said, we have leeway to use "professional judgment" in unusual situations when it comes to dependency. This would 110% qualify, in my mind. If OP provided me a copy of the police report and a written summary of their situation, I'd push that dependency override straight through."
personalfinance,"So this is such a massive question that its really even hard to start on.   First things first, a credit card is a card that is basically an acceptance of the credit agreement which says that the credit card company will pay for whatever it is that you are buying now. In return, you will pay them back later with interest. Some cards have an introductory period of 0%, and most will give you a "grace period" where you don't have any interest charged on the purchase (usually only the billing cycle) but you will HAVE to pay them back eventually.   If you buy something on a credit card, its not "free money" it is you borrowing from "tomorrow's money," getting today what you might have had to save up for to buy. The best way to beat them at their own game though is to never spend more on your credit card then you can pay back that billing period.   E.G. if you make $1000 a month, don't buy anything or spend more than $1000 that month on your card or you will not pay off your card and will be charged interest on the balance.   Building a credit score is simply a matter of having a monthly bill (it doesn't have to be a credit card necessarily) and paying it every month. Missing a payment or not paying the bills will give negative marks, and paying on time and paying off debt will give positive marks. It does take time to build a credit score though and you shouldn't expect a 750-800 FICO score after a few months. Having negative marks on accounts though can really hurt credit scores so even if you can't pay off a debt, keeping up with the minimum payments will at least help build your credit.   Minimum payments will end up in you paying WAY more than what it would have cost just paying cash up front so be careful about spending more than you can pay off."
personalfinance,"To learn about credit is to learn about credit cards. They're interrelated.   This:   > Learn about money and how it works and how to make it work for you before trying to borrow it.   Does NOT entail this:   > Using credit cards to learn about credit is simply the wrong way to go.   You can use a credit card and pay it off immediately. Credit is an integral part of our society and credit cards are an integral part of learning how credit works. Also, having one is intensely beneficial to an 18 year old. Your argument is like saying that people shouldn't use electricity until they know how to wire a lamp, or drive until they can build their own car."
personalfinance,"I personally have a lot of debt and I'm following some of Dave Ramsey's baby steps to pay these off. Starting off with his plan, I was completely averse to credit cards, however I've changed my opinion regarding them. I began to use a GREAT budgeting software called YNAB (You Need a Budget) (watch for Steam sales), and after taking their free classes (I highly recommend), I saw how you can leverage credit cards, get their rewards, and never pay anything in interest."
personalfinance,"Yes.  Well, mostly someone else's favor that I care deeply for, but still yes.  A dear friend finally admitted why they had been acting strange, nervous, stressed, and crying mostly out of sight but finally in sight.  They needed to come up with $3,500 within two days or they could face criminal conviction and career ruin.  Despite having near no debt at the time, and reasonable credit, that kind of money was unavailable to me in that span of time.  So I called the company that was always on TV offering outrageous loans, and I got the required money deposited in my account that next day at a 99% interest rate.  I withdrew the cash my friend required and saved them from any negative effects. Saved their day and arguably their bacon.   I then, with more time on my hands, went to another lending institution and got an unsecured personal loan for the same amount at about a 16% interest rate.  A week later I had the funds, paid off the ridiculous loan, and then within about four months paid of the more reasonable loan.   They are still very dear to me, and I don't regret any of my actions.  Payday loans can solve emergencies, you just have to be diligent (and not unlucky) for them not to make matters worse. :)"

pitbulls,"I would say this homeowner is a coward for sending his dog in first. If this intruder were armed, he surely would have turned the weapon on the dog and the owner would have basically commanded his dog to rush head first into its own death. In my opinion, the only dogs that should be protecting humans, are those dogs that have been trained to do so from a very young age.   The article said that the homeowner's phone was damaged during the altercation. Why didn't he just call the police instantly before confronting the intruder? I'll tell you why, because he had a "pit bull" with him. This is the worst kind of owner, I know so many of them. They try to act like an average dog owner, but deep down they are always looking for a chance to "test" their dog. So woefully misinformed about this breed are these owners, that they wish to test their dog against a human, even though pits have been bred to show restraint toward humans even in the most heated of situations.   My dog is bred of game blood and was picked first out of his litter particularly for his "fire". I have no doubt that he would enthusiastically engage in a fight to the death with any living thing threatening him or a member of his pack (me & my gf). Throughout my life, if a tense situation between humans was brewing, the first thing I did was remove my dog from the area.   In the case of an unknown intruder, I would protect my dog like I would a child. I would try to get the dog into a secure space and then deal with the situation on my own. In a worst case scenario I would let the dog make its own decision and would not try to command him to protect me. The dog is not capable of thinking on a human level and people are much more capable and efficient killers than any dog could ever be."
medicine,"It means long work days, large amounts of thankless paperwork and poor pay.   You're totally beating around the bush here.  Lets just come right out and say it, if you take USMLE Step 1 scores combined with the #applicant/#resident spots ratio, you end up with "how competitive a field is to get into".  This is about as quantitative as you can get here...   Now take that Plot that vs. the avg salary per hour worked, and I bet you quickly figure out what attracts people to what field (hint, its the $$$/hr).   So what am I trying to say?  Here it is: don't blame the doctors, blame the system, where the ROADS specialties 3x as much and realistically works 60-100% of the hours of FP/IM/Peds with next to no serious call."
medicine,"It's been a few years, but speaking as someone who went through both an MD and a PhD it's hard but not that intellectually challenging. Really exhaustion and panic are the two predominant emotions.   First day of first year, we were handed textbooks and told "read the first three chapters by tomorrow." The biochem and cell bioloy were mostly review (although at a very fast pace) but the anatomy and histology were totally new. Our first year was filled with these big fundamental courses like those and neurosciences, pathology, physiology, pharmacology, genetics, and so forth. IIRC there were four half-semesters in the first year, and all the tests came at the end of the half-semester. So even if you had a two week module on behavioral sciences at the first half of the half-semester, that test came right at the end. So the last month was just sheer unbridled panic trying to get all of that material together. My day was classes 8-12, sometimes with a lab in the early afternoon. Go home, nap for a few hours, eat dinner, then start studying. The amount of studying I would do would increase through the half-semester. By the end, I would study until I heard the newspaper hit the front door at around 4:30 AM, then sleep until 7.  The pace of material was ludicrous. All anatomy, histologic patterns of normal tissue, complete metabolism, neuroscience and neuroanatomy, fundamentals of signal transduction and cell biology, all in one year. Basically the equivalent of the major classes of a Bachelor of Science in Biology in 1 year. The term we used was "information lottery" -- you basically cram a relatively random slice of the information you were exposed to into your skull and then hope that the final exam reflected a reasonable overlap with that.   Second year was based on organ system and it was much more rational to fit things together in order to develop an understanding. It was also mostly new material and stuff that you actually wanted to learn, like how people get sick. So one eight week block was cardiology with cardiac physiology, pharmacology, anatomy review, how to read EKGs, and an intro to cardiac disease. Then pulmonary, then rheumatology, etc. etc. We had six months of that to finish our eighteen months of basic sciences. At the end we had finals on all of those and also a big test over all of first year and second year, a warmup to the USMLE step I exam.   We started clinical rotations after that and did those until the end of school. Wards were, for the most part, a lot of fun. You start to hang out with doctors and learn pretty quickly how to make the most of the situation for you and for the residents you are working with. Your grade basically depends mostly on that -- basically on how much you don't irritate the doctors. Sometimes you run into a bad apple, sometimes you end up on a stultifying rotation (hello pediatric ophtho!), sometimes you end up taking intense call, but it is mostly pretty fun because it's the closest thing you do to being a doctor in school. You also realize that the majority of the first eighteen months were useless. At the end of each rotation, there is a final exam and you are graded by evaluation as well. Sometimes there is no-fun stuff like mock patients. Not very difficult although it is a totally different set of skills (people skills) that many med students have not had much practice with.   The"

gadgets,"So, really, I think you should reconsider the advice you're giving here. If you've ever worked with powertools or tried to actually get scratches out of glass, you'll realize your advice won't help much. It takes a  lot  of effort to get scratches out of glass. We're talking powertools at high RPMs with polishing compound power. Not just "wiping". In the old days, toothpaste could be used to polish out plastic, but glass? Nope.   Furthermore, Oleophobic coatings these days will last for years and years. It takes a good amount of abuse to get rid of them - and when they wear through - you will see it. There will be a different tint to the glass surface at the sites of wear-through. If you presently do not see any patch of wear through on your phone, you should  not  attempt any of the advice here - you will only shorten the lifespan of your coatings.   Toothpaste is for the old days. Only do it if you have NO oleophobic coating left ony our phone. Otherwise, you will exacerbate the problem and destroy more of the coating."

gadgets,"Everyone has to start somewhere. Just because you are impatient and cant wait 5 minutes for the employee you just talked too to go find someone who is more knowledgeable about the product doesn't mean you should prefer robots over humans. How is that robot going to respond when you need to know some out of the box answer that doesn't logically make sense.   Hopefully there are more people out there who realize that the expansion of this into other superstores would result in millions of jobs vanishing into thin air. Most people have worked retail in their lives, and if they haven't then they sure need too. You meet a lot of good, hardworking people who need the jobs that they have. Who rely on their job to help feed their family, or rely on their job as a lowly sales associate to make connections that will lead to furthering their careers within the company.   I work at a hardware store and I seriously doubt that that robot could interpret the mumbling, southern drawl, and mispronunciation that I hear daily from contractors. Not to mention the people who don't even know what they are looking for in the first place.

gadgets,"Right, a couple of things. While I agree that 4K is not that viable yet. Your arguments and stats are not actually that accurate.   while you didn't claim this, it's important to be clear with this. Blu-ray is not fully uncompressed. The current compression type of Blu-ray is H.264(most of the time). Now. If we ignore the audio The bit-rate of a Blu-ray video is usually around 20-30 Mbps when using H.264. the maximum an A/V disk is capable of is 48 Mbps so the audio is not actually that big of a problem as you claim it to be due to the technical limitations of Blu-ray   Recently two new codecs have arisen. VP9 and H.265. Both are about equally efficient and I won't go into detail about them. Though they are the reason I think 4k is a while off. Not all hardware supports them and some only supports one or the other(so until this is fixed, no mass 4k content) The interesting thing about the codecs is that they are much more efficient. Roughly twice as much.   Companies claim to stream visually lossless 4K at around 20-30Mbps, some even at 8 Mbps but that's only in blind consumer world. So the same speed at 1080p Blu-ray now(which again, is also not actually uncompressed at all). So 4K on Blu-ray is perfectly viable and will look pretty damn good thanks to these new compression types.   Now for the internet part.  Wireless streaming at 4K is more of a receiver support problem. You can get a 5GH router with 802.11ac capabilities and run at an advertised speed of up to 733Mbps over LAN realistically closer to 500Mbps   About the actual internet part. sorry but in places other than the USA 100Mbps is not only avalible now but has been for a couple of years. My current provider(Ziggo) had 120Mbps availible back in 2009 in an all in one pack for 鈧?5  since then they threw the speed up to 180Mbps  with it.   While these speeds are premium and reasonably expensive.([it's actually not that much more than slower choices](   So basically with a little increase in monthly internet costs(鈧?0 more a month if you are at the cheapest pack on Ziggo for example to get to 90/9) A decent router starting at ~鈧?5  here   So basically the only thing in the way of 4K is companies actually streaming it and Comcast finally giving people decent internet.(no 4K in the USA probably ends up meaning no 4K anywhere)"
youtubecomments,"You must have never been to 4chan. Its ok, your prolly better off.   Around '04-ish some people started to act like the /b/ random board had been some sort of treasure trove of originality that was getting polluted by newcomers that didn't understand stuff. Theres some amount of truth to this, but the call and response goes 'Remember when /b/ was good?' '/b/ was never good.'   Either way, there began to be loads of reposts of stupid threads and camwhores (who were a lot more annoying and attention whorey than even the worst gw girls today). The way /b/ works though, there could literally be like 3 different versions of the same stupid thread on the front page.   Peoples started referring to this stuff as 'the cancer that is killing /b/' and then you start getting sites like 9gag and its predecessors that were literally reposing screenshots from /b/, or poorly reproducing jokes.   Theres this kinda elitist mentality that I personally can only trace back to /b/ that probably goes farther back, but certainly persists today into things like reddit. (When you see your friend posting a link to a page thats just a bunch of stuff you've already seen on reddit, especially if it was reddit OC, you think they're less cool then you. Less in the know)   For example, lolcats. Caturday had been a thing for a good few years, where every saturday people would flood the internet with creative image macros of cats.

hacking,"In the past 13 years, if someone found an exploit for XP, they could exploit it only for as long as it took Microsoft to discover the vulnerability, patch it, and release the patch, usually on patch Tuesday.  They had to try and hide their exploit from discovery, as once it's discovered, Microsoft can find and fix the problem.  That was when Microsoft said they would patch exploits in XP.   Now imagine that any exploit you find is guaranteed NOT to be patched, as Microsoft is no longer patching XP.  You don't have to worry nearly as much anymore about constantly evolving existing exploits and discovering new ones.  Found one that works?  It'll continue to work, whether it's discovered "in the wild" or not.  With the install base of XP still being relatively high, it creates some extremely appealing targets.   Consider this: if in the past couple of months you found an XP exploit, would you rather A) exploit it now and risk it getting patched in the next couple of months, or B) hide your exploit from the world until AFTER the final XP patch from Microsoft is released, then exploit away as much as you wanted?"
ecology,"One thing I have been told multiple times is that if you have any field or lab experience and you really connected to a grad student or professor, see what the programs are like at the school where they got their masters, PhD or maybe even were a postdoc at. This can open up doors for you! For instance, you can put the person you connected to (let's call them person A) as one of your references. I'd put them near the top of your list. Person A went to Berkeley. You decide to look into Berkeley's programs. You find that person A knows many of the faculty members as they were very active in the department. You submit your application to the person with the project you're most interested in, (person B) but you say is okay if it doesn't work out with them, you wouldn't mind working with someone else. Person B sees person A on your references list and remembers that person A still has his Janis Joplin album and has been meaning to call him anyway! He calls up person A, they catch up, then B asks A about you. A raves about you and says "you'd be missing out if you didn't take this wonderful person on." B then looks at what you are interested in and realizes (with a little help from the positive words of his friend) you would be the perfect fit! Assuming you pass the interview.  Good luck with everything!! I don't know much about deadlines, I just thought this might be a way to shorten the time it would take."

Sick of the botting I thought I鈥檇 make a new account to play with.   I set up a YouTube channel advertising scripts that you normally had to pay for free. a popular one was a bot or script that would do dungeoneering. I made a very convincing video but all it did was put a rat (remote admin tool) on the pc and never worked. I used it to collect the password, because they were all using bots there pins where stored in the Runescape buddy client in a plain text file.  Making it easy to get into their bank accounts and take their stuff.   This went on for a good month, ended up being a lot of fun. I had practically unlimited money. I gave it away, diced, and had drop parties in the party room. Accumulating several rares and a max cash stack, I considered myself a robin hood only targeting people botting.   Then one day bank standing at the grand exchange, the account auto logged out and was perm banned for account hijacking. Surprised but not sad, I never got the temptation to give any money to my main account, Ever. My main did get locked but it was likely due to them following my IP address.

If there were many people in the same house who all played RuneScape, that's all perfectly fine in Jagex's eyes. We conclude that Jagex must be willing to accept multiple accounts signed on using the same IP address. Otherwise, they'd have to limit accounts to one per household, which is certainly not fair.   You can use a proxy if it will make you feel any better, but it would make no difference as Jagex sees it."

Now imagine anything you try, you can't execute. We end the match, Scorpion gets a flawless victory.

rape,"For anyone lurking who is looking for advice, I'll give some follow up information:   If your situation matches mine, I'd suggest looking at yourself critically and how you usually deal with difficult situations. Then knock your ability to handle hard things down a couple notches. I'm usually very good at "numbing" myself to situations that I find are hard to deal with emotionally, typically to the point that I don't have to think about them until someone brings it up.   Given the background on me, this is how things progressed in the month after I posted this:   At a large party (where he was), I got super drunk and hugged him and told him I forgave him. He looked like he was going to cry out of happiness and was like "seriously?" and then hugged me back. On one hand, I regret that my drunken, emotionally stoic (because I was in a public area) self got to make the decision for me to tell him that I was okay. On the other hand, it was bothering me that I couldn't see his guilt all over his face (he had to act as normal as I had to, if we didn't want people asking questions) and seeing that relief confirmed to me that it WAS on his mind. He didn't just  stop  feeling like shit.   I can now handle him in group settings. I definitely have to make a conscious decision to sit down where he is, whereas before, it wouldn't take a second for me to think. If he's sitting down with one other person, I typically won't sit down because if the other person leaves, then I'm stuck. It's become more of a "person you try to avoid, but will deal with if your friends are the glue in a situation" relationship. Our one on one situations are still weird though. Quiet, we avoid each other, leave when in each others' presence alone.   How I feel right now:   It makes me incredibly sad to know we will never be the friends we used to be. I wish we were. Some nights, I imagine curled up alone in a blanket, sitting in the same room as him and just crying. It comforts me to know that he knows how I'm affected, and I think that this situation I keep imagining is partially because I want him to feel bad, and partially because I want him to be my friend again.   I don't feel like a rape victim, I feel like a victim of trust breach. That definitely helps  FOR ME.  It may not be the case for all (or probably most) of y'all.

This photograph echoes all the happy accidents where a heretofore unrecognized geometry shows itself as we make the slightest deviations in our normal course of viewing he world (in this case looking up at an odd angle to a backlit building).   The photograph's edge bisecting the window reminds us that this is part of a larger whole, that the building continues on, and as such the presented view is an artifact of an extemporaneous intention. If the windows all appeared whole and in frame, it would dramatically alter the picture for me. The image becomes a translation or projection of a formal composition, denying the original happy accident's existence.   Perhaps formality has a stultifying effect on photos more reactive than contemplative?"
phoenix,"As someone who lived next-door to a heroin dealer who liked to "start the party" at 11PM and not quit until 5-6AM....we asked him to dial it down once. Never again. Straight to the police, who incidentally never showed up because I would only make the complaint anonymously so the police didn't come to  my  door to make me sign it.   If they had only come out for our noise complaints, the US Marshals and ATF wouldn't have had to get involved a few months later, leading to ATF breaking down his door and the guy flipping his car 4 feet from my parking space in our parking alley."
newhampshire,"It's sort of a step in the right direction, but c'mon, prohibition is just indefensible as a policy or position.  It's non-sensical and self-defeating, not to mention authoritarian and a collective violation of our human rights.   I mean, look at this [this map]( it's  pathetic  that the "Live Free or Die" state is the only blank in a sea of green New England states that have decriminalized to varying degrees.  How absurd that you could stand by the border and a matter of a few feet could mean the difference between a misdemeanor and a mere fine?  It's going to be increasingly difficult for them to prevent the flow across borders anyway....   Also, I will reproduce a relevant comment I made on an WMUR story about the bill:   With Colorado now and Vermont decriminalizing, I don't see how opponents can keep making their arguments with a straight face. It's clear the tide is turning. It's clear prohibition has always been a failure of a policy. I can think of nothing more anti-American, anti-freedom, anti-NH/Live Free or Die than the criminalization of marijuana.... forget medicinal, if you are against full legalization then you do not truly value liberty.   Marijuana is one of nature's most benign and useful PLANTS- such hubris to think we humans could "outlaw" something natural that has been around far longer than we have. It is just absurd on its face. (Imagine a community of rabbits outlawing a certain kind of carrot.... rounding up any rabbits who eat that carrot and putting them in makeshift cages for half their lives.... RIDICULOUS, right??)   It is immoral to deny sick patients free access to their medicine, and perhaps less so, but still immoral, to deny citizens the freedom to decide to alter or not to alter their own consciousness. It's time we called it what it is-- a fundamental human right on par with freedom of expression and religion. No state power should have the right to control the very chemistry of our own brains.   People claim it is to "protect the children," but this argument holds no water. It is self-serving willful ignorance and corruption that is keeping the status quo in place, not "protecting the children." In fact, ironically, the legalization/regulation model is FAR better at keeping substances out of the hands of children-- look at alcohol and cigarettes.... much harder for kids to get than black-market substances. That is a FACT. What valid argument could possibly dispute that??   I want to ask those who are against legalization if they are comfortable with being DIRECTLY responsible for MORE kids having access to marijuana-- because that's exactly what they are doing whether they realize/admit it or not. They are causing to happen the very thing they supposedly are against and use to justify their backwards position."

offmychest,"Have you been to a therapist?  I know lots of people don't like the idea of going to a psychologist, but IMO every single person should do it.  The fact is that a person's ability to live a satisfying life depends on having certain skills, and those skills can be very difficult to learn because they are dependent on self-awareness and evaluation.  Human beings are not at all good at either of those two things - and I think that there's a really good reason for that, but that's a whole other topic - and so it's usually necessary to rely on another person for feedback to learn certain behaviors and skills.  Lots of the time this feedback comes from trusted friends, but if a person doesn't have any of those or if their friends don't have those skills either, then it's wise to turn to someone else.   I'm talking about skills like conversation, flirting, being a good friend, taking personal responsibility, conflict resolution, being aware of the effects of your behavior on others, prioritizing things that are emotionally important to you and others, learning how to maximize your enjoyment of life.  People tend to think of these things as just things that you know or you don't, but they can be learned.   You may think that you have all the necessary skills already, but the evidence indicates that you do not.  If you have ruled out all of the obvious reasons (like being a liar, thief, drug addict, stinky person, bigot, etc.) then it's likely some other skill that's difficult to self-evaluate.  My father is a great example of this.  He is actually a great guy.  He's funny, intelligent, successful, healthy, and all of that obvious stuff.  The problem is, he's a jerk.  He doesn't listen, jokes about things that are offensive, and is generally rude.  However, he doesn't recognize that because he is terrible at reading other people's reactions and empathizing.  In fact, he is totally cringe-worthy and he has no idea.  Since he's been seeing a therapist, he's gotten a lot better, but he's nearly 70 so there's only so much re-learning that he's going to do at this point."
offmychest,"friend of Y and Zimpo here, aaaand I kinda hafta side with Zimpo in this thing.  I  responded to the FB status where she decided to post the answer X gave her, and everyone and their grandmother started to attack me for being and I'm not even making this up "ussupportive of a friend in need", yeah, that's right, I'm the one pointing out that posting personal messages on your wall is highly unethical and possible illegal and I'm the bad guy!   sure Zimpo isn't perfect but every time I tried to get Y to tell me exactly what X, Z, and  Zimpo did that was so horrible it sprung her into defence mode (read: bitch passive aggressive mode) she became more vague and less responsive. my guess is she is fully aware she's not without fault in this matter, but rather than woman up and talk to her now former flatmates, she passively aggressively attacks them on a FB. so mature."
offmychest,"Really IIRC you didn't. besides as soon as you started, Y's friend (let's call her C) said she wasn't comfortable talking about Y behind her back, albeit it being rather benign "we're concerned about her" convo, and you dropped it, and we talked about other stuff.   C did however tell Y that people were talking and even if C really didn't say anything, Y was pretty quick to guess who was responsible (really if a friend tells you that other friends are concerned and your first reaction is to yell at a completely different friend because "she's the one that tattletale!" you really need to rethink your life) and went apeshit on Zimpo. because there's no way we could have heard those rumours (is it a rumour if it's true?) from 10 different other people.   also, aint the first time she pulls something like that. she blew up on me last year for spreading a rumour about her. I was seriously the last person to find out, and was casually talking about "all the rumours about Y" with same friends (C and let's call the other one S) as you and I were talking. C then tells Y we'd spent a whole evening going through every nasty rumour about Y (C conveniently left out she not only took part but encouraged us if we were about to drop it). turns out Y hates S and just didn't want S to think Y is slutty, because that makes S a better person than Y."
offmychest,"As someone whos literally just had a vagina put in yesterday, let me say in no uncertain terms that ive been there. Ive stared long and hard about the repercussions, the problems, the risks of transition. I never expected anyone to support me. I expected to be disowned, to lose my job, to be abandoned by my friends. I decided that suicide was a better option, because on the off chance reincarnation is real i had a 50/50 chance of coming back right.   But then i remembered all those people i was scared of being forgotten by, didnt even know me. They would bury me as their son, boyfriend, best mate. They would say what a good man i was as they straightened my suit and combed my short hair. I couldnt stand that thought.   So i decided to try live as myself, because then at least i would die right. I came out. And instead of disowning me, my family accepted me, my friends supported me, and my work understood and helped me too. I admit i was very lucky, and it doesnt always work out that way for trans people.   But for me it was worth the risk. And now here i am, unable to poop for 5 days while my vagina heals."
offmychest,"Do you want to be engaged with a ring and plan a wedding, or is it more you are looking for some type of "social declaration" that you are a very serious and permanent couple? I think that a lot of it is this. Being engaged and married really doesn't change the dynamics of a relationship beyond making in legal on paper--which is important for many reasons I won't list here--but it makes you feel better because it validates the relationship. If you have been together for a while and have talked about it, and she says that she might propose over the summer, I would just chill and wait for that.  I would totally stop nagging her because it may sound like you don't beleive her that she loves you and wants to marry you, that you don't trust her, and you seem wedding obsessed which is totally unttractive. And plus rings are expensive, yo!!! Maybe she's saving up. A wedding is just one stupid day."
wikipedia,"Not really scary.  It's more that I'm worried about being wrong when I admit to my beliefs.  The core of my understanding comes from things that I have heard.  Now, I don't mind being proven wrong.  I welcome proof.  But, I fear the results of others when they hear that I so wholeheartedly desire belief that I dig through so many sources, as well, some of the sources being more common to their understanding, they will be more likely to criticize.   The basic explanation that I had heard in regards to the Sumers, for example sounded along these lines.   "Aliens come down and find human ancestors.  Aliens find ancestors interesting and play with their DNA." missing link explanation given here.  "Aliens come back down and are amazed at the results, and start to help, while maintaining their interest in genetic manipulation, birthing strange beasts, while assisting their earlier progeny."  So, we have a basic example of their 'gods' walking amongst them, and with that coming the space-ship descriptions, as well, they mention details of creatures of myth, specifically along the titans line, which, were mentioned within Judaeism, Greek, and probably more.   It's the cross-overs within the different religious sects, even when you space out their existances upon the world that give me hope.  There are other devices I had mentioned, but, they have no place within the common mindset.  My amazement at these possibilities mean nothing to those that I mention them to.  If they hold no value, they are of no consequence.   Of mild consequence, however, were two things that I recall being out of place in their discoveries, or in details related to themselves in question.  I recall there being an aluminum chunk discovered amongst fossil remain aged material, no specific details other than it was aluminum, and contained angles that were too specific to be naturally formed by coincidence.  The second artifact was smaller, said to be taken from a UFO and also aluminum.  The detail that made it interesting was when they were talking about it's qualities.  That it's density was like nothing that mankind had created thus far, and it's capabilities in terms of tolerances suggested that could only have been created under special circumstances, but was still aluminum.   Now, those both sound like BS.  I know it.  I want to believe, so I dig further.  Artifact two's creation, has been placed into the super-atom theories that are being mentioned on occasion within reddit (see articles refering to the periodic table acquiring potential 3D aspect, or how the electron trade theories within the metallics allow for potential shifts unknown to mankind at this time.  Digging a step further, if you go into fields such as anti-gravity, materials are mentioned as being required, one being a magnetic superfluid (I would think that a diamagnetic superfluid would be sufficient, but, whatever, I can't think of any of those anyways) and mentionings about supposed UFO crashes, and people finding a mercury like substance within a closed loop (the toroid is a common form for force manipulation devices.  Interesting note.  Mercury is diamagnetic, however, I could not find any information that would allow for mercury to be in a superfluid state.  However, I would surmise that since it's natural state is as a freely flowing fluid (at room-temperature, at least.) that it may be possible for the states of mercury to be shifted possibly to the required density/flow rates/flow directions) under the right pressures/conditions......................   arrgh.  Sorry.  Look, sorry"
wikipedia,"In basic, yes.  In complex, well, I guess still yes, as my meandering thoughts pretty much traveled that path.   I'm fairly defensive, but, in the end, I guess that Raelism is an aspect of potential that I hold onto, as I do not wish to hold onto a series of beliefs that are potentially wrong, though the evidence I see seems as strong to myself as the miracles of god would hold through christianity/catholicism/any other number of beliefs.   Personally, I identify as atheistic, but, well, yeah.  I believe that the paths that have been passed down have been from ETs and that we can find moral values throughout the religious spectrum that were implanted early on in the human psyche, with the stories told behind as methods to assist others to understand why.  I've heard that the stories told through religion has shifted as humanity has looked for alternative goals within it's story telling, adapting in truths, and substituting out others.   I do believe in aliens.  I do believe that we don't have a bloody clue as to what the actual reality of the situation is.  I do not wish to be proven wrong by minor evidence, as there is so much out there, and we compose so tiny a quantity of matter within the visualized universe, that I am worried.  But, yes, I do agree with ancient astronaut theory.   I am troubled a little bit by some details by theory, as the Sumers stated that there were 10 planets, with the 10 being the home of their 'gods.'"  This used to be easily palatable, with considering Pluto to be planet #9, but with the creation of the dwarf planet class, and discovering multiple other dwarf planets within our solar system, it's hard to hold onto it as a local (galaxy wide) possibility of a belief.   (ultimate belief) There is more to the galaxy than we understand.  There is more to the evolution of mankind, and the influences of outside sources then we can understand.  Final truth will be revealed only to the sceptics, and to those who desire understanding to what is going on."
SkincareAddiction,"I used it once last week. I plan on doing it tomorrow, since I used it last Wednesday.   Directions say to do it once a week and to keep using the cleanser/toner/moisturizer, but it breaks me out horribly so I don't do that. It says you're supposed to cleanse with it beforehand, but I just used a wet microfiber towel and patted it on my face to clean it gently.   If you plan on using something like this, please, follow the directions in it. Seriously, you could hurt yourself or be allergic to the product. At least do it how it says the first time, then fiddle around with it. Patch test it. It says that in there too.   Also, you will need to stay out of the sun if you use this. At least for the rest of the day. So you could try it at night if you want. Or on a day you weren't going to go out. The next day, you MUST use sun screen. Your skin will be pretty sensitive to it, even if it doesn't feel like it.   You might feel tingly or slightly itchy after you wash the peel off. This is normal, but if it gets to be too much, I'd call a health clinic or a doctor. Your face might be slightly red right after, but that's also normal. Any serious pain isn't."

paintball,"I haven't paintballed with a gopro, but I've go 4x4ing and snowmobiling with one on my helmet. When i got thrown over the bars of my snowmobile and smashed into a surprisingly strong oak, hitting directly on the lense of my dad's hero 2, hard enough that i was briefly knocked out, the thing was fine. I left a dent in the goddamm tree. And when they say waterproof to 5 meters, they mean it... had mine buried in a mud hole, covered in thrown snow after a nasty spill down a mountain, etc, and it was fine. not even a scratch.   the ONLY thing that ever damaged it was when I got run over by my own snowmobile - the frame handle on the front scratched the front and knocked the adjustment point backwards. It's worth noting this same hit had me bleeding from the mouth and back, mildly burned on my arm, and barely conscious, sliding down a mountain."

beer,"I guess everywhere has their own stories.  I "discovered" PBR during my broke days in college in 2005.  Our favorite watering hole had PBR for 50 cent draft or $1 a can.  Of course we flocked to it because it was cheap as hell and tasted better than most of the cheap swill like busch, old mil, and high life.  This was the only bar in town that I know of that had PBR at the time.  It wasn't till a few years ago that PBR tallboys, cans, and bottles were available in every store here."
beer,"There are definitions of beer styles but you see a lot of breweries stretching those styles in various directions not too mention the variety of unofficial sub-styles that crop up. I'm thinking of all the India XXX Ales that have cropped up to denote heavily hopped variants of traditionally non-hoppy styles.   Then you have the forgotten styles of beer that are not commonly seen but that some brewers are trying to resurrect, I've seen a couple different folks do a gose in my area recently. As brewers look to distinguish themselves from the pack I can only imagine this being an increasingly common thing.   Then you just have the crazy experimental stuff that some folks are doing that really doesn't fit into any particular style. Dogfish Head seems to lead the pack on this one but a number of other brewers are stretching themselves in this realm."

PostCollapse,"Kindof a side note but a friend watched The Road and was like 'why didn't they just stay at the bunker' that's when attention to detail pays off, because that dog bark means volumes to a guy like The Man.   It means he's still being followed, they have their sent, they'll find him in the bunker eventually so they can't stay.  He's dying, he could just die comfortably in the bunker in a bed and let his kid deal with it but he knows one of two things, and there's no way to tell which.   a these people who are not eating their dog, can afford not to eat their dog, are friendly just looking for folks to team up and are following them for what reason?  Why would they be good allies?  A dying man and a kid?  This seems so unlikely.   b these people keep a dog alive to hunt people to eat, but that doesn't make any sense either because this dog has been following them for weeks, how come they haven't revealed themselves?   But he can't take a chance, and he has no idea who these crazy people are who aren't eating their dog, following these people with no resource gain, in a world where every decision is about resource gain.   So the man doesn't take any chances and dies on the sand, the reason they were being followed was not because of the dog, or the other man or the other kids, but the mother of those other kids.  She made the veteran with the shotgun and 2 kids and a dog chase the man because he had the kid, but for good reasons, because she was building a team of kids knowing the two they had were going to need help, and also out of a love for children.   Now that woman, her movie is the real movie, and I suspect Cormac McCarthy knows he is unequipped to write about that character.  I see the entire story of The Road as being a side-story to what her and the veteran are accomplishing, which could be the key to the survival and rebirth of the race.   Thinking about that woman's motivation, how she would have seen all that, and go through all of that, and risk everything, for a third child that wasn't even her own and that she'd never met...The veteran is a pretty cool dude too, putting up with that.  Conserving that many shotgun shells.  Anyone with 10 shotgun shells by the end of that movie would be a king, and here he goes traipsing off in support of a mother on a quest to save children.   One step further back, look around you now, how would we all be transformed?  who among us would be the cannibals?  Who would be the wife who ran off to die in the dark?  Who would be the man?   Who would be the veteran?  What mother do you know who would do that?  What would it be like to grow up in the shadow of that father?   What were those first 5 years after the disaster really like?   I could go on but I'll stop."

LifeProTips,"A little off point but I have a funny story about shooting Vodka (Wodka) with Russians. I spent a year abroad in Harbin China in 1997. It was a language immersion program. Very few non Chinese.... For those of you not familiar with Harbin it is in Northern China. Very close to the Russian border and very far away from Beijing. Fucking freezing in the winter. (Think Siberia) Anyway, me and another American buddy of mine went to a Dance Club one Friday that was referred to as "The Russian Disco" It was run by Chinese people but 98% of the customers were Russian. Not your average Russians either. These were Russian smugglers, Mobster types. Back in the late 90s Russians still had trouble getting normal everyday things like shampoo, normal house stuff so there was a market for Russians to smuggle even stranger shit (Puppies, cars, furs etc.) into China so they could purchase and bring these household goods back to Russia to sell at inflated rates.. After long hours of ripping other Russians and Chinese off they would unwind at the "Russian Disco" The first night we were there we showed up to find a Club with the Base pumping and a ton of Huge Scary Bear sized Russian men all completely stoned and drunk... While pensive at first we had two cute Serbian girls from the University with us so we jumped in. Wasn't that bad. The Russians were in a good mood from gallons and gallons of Wodka. The one thing I noticed was when a lot of them did a shot they would chase it with Pineapple juice. A few drinks in my buddy did a shot with a guy who weighed no less then 400 lbs and all of it was muscle and when the guy tried to give him a pineapple chaser my buddy (who was toasty by now from Wodka) declined and said in Chinese "only women chase vodka with fruit drinks." ......... I heard it and cringed. Quickly looked at him and gave him the "Have you lost your fucking mind?" look. The Russian instead of killing us both where we stood laughed and poured us another shot! Thank god the Russian guy whose name ended up being Volodya had a sense of humor. We ended up going out to eat at 5 the next morning with Volodya and his crew as well as a bunch of sexy Russian Bunnies. Good Night. I've tried to be friendly with Russians whenever I meet them after that."

LifeProTips,"I see what he's thinking, I just don't think it's possible to remove human judgement and still have a system that works.   Your friend thinks the officer was taking petty revenge.  I don't think that's the case.  The law about updating your license is not a "bullshit law" that needs to be removed.  It's not a law that most people don't follow, and it's not something the officer generally won't enforce when it comes to their attention.  I think that normally the officer never would have noticed that he was breaking that law, but he acted in the most suspicious possible way he could have acted, causing the officer to take a closer look at him.  When the officer took a closer look, the officer found actual, legitimate breach of laws that actually matter.   So under his system he still would have been nailed, and under his system that law would still persist.   I think what's really going on is your friend is butthurt that his hostile handling of authority got him in trouble with said authority.  It doesn't matter who he shows that attitude to, cops, boss, waitress, guy in a retail store, if you treat people like that you're gonna have a bad time in regards to your interaction with that person.  I can't think of anything legal to do during a stop that would have looked more suspicious to an officer, and if you make yourself look suspicious to an officer, that officer is going to thoroughly check you out to find out what you're trying to hide."

I messed up my shoulder ramming against trying open it.

Luckily, I was able to force my body through, causing a deep bruise from my collar bone to hip bone. Once I got to shore, I realized the idiot driver was still in the car(holding his breath while grabbing sunglasses, CDs etc. Pulled him out, and luckily we were fine besides mild concussions."

What's going on is it relieves the immense pressure of the sexual desire component of attraction; the instinctual drive to mate translates into obsessing over winning the person romantically. Take that out of the equation and you still are attracted to the person, but it's no longer an all consuming drive. That drive can be great when you're actually interacting with the person, making you more confident and less reserved, but when you're apart and therefore can't advance things further it just makes you extremely frustrated.   Woo,"
LifeProTips,"Okay, I have good news and bad news. I'm not going to ask what you'd like first as I feel like that would delay us unnecessarily. Instead I'll roll play for effect.  Me: Okay, would you like the good or bad news first.   Me again Pretending to be you: Ahh bad I guess.   Me as myself: Okay.   Right, to the point. The bad news is, you seemed to have misunderstood the concept somewhat. The good new is, it's okay as I will go to great lengths to help you grasp the idea. So don't panic. Yet.  Right. Traditionally, one makes one fluid cut down the center of the lemon, which as shown above, results in two halves with one or both containing seeds( and who wants that?). Instead, with this fabulous method you make a cut slightly off to the left or right of the center, then another cut in the same place on the remaining section of lemon. You will now have two hopefully seed free lemon pieces ready for cutting into wedges, and a left over "cross-section" containing the seeds and pithy section.   I really hope you now understand the idea our good friend here as tried to introduce us too; which so far only seems have been met with negative hostility by the self confessed "industry" experts."

LifeProTips,"There's a huge amount of stuff on this. I highly suggest looking at fountain pen forums and blogs. Those people are experts at the stuff. You'll learn about calligraphy, handwriting etc.   Primary issue: Death grip.   Whatever you do, ensure you do not have death grip and instead get tripod grip. Google those. Death grip can quite literally kill your wrist/hand. It probably won't and will only give you bone issues, but still, those hurt. For example, bakers who still bake oldschool with huge ovens... they need to take huge plates out of the oven. Huge plates with lots of pies on them. These plates are heavy. Wrists are not designed for this kind of heavy. At a young age they may feel a bit of strain and it will go away. At age 60 their wrists will grow locked and/or give massive pain. Same goes for holding a pen wrong if you write a lot, even if only a little.   You probably will want to upgrade to a fountain pen. Ballpoints are based on friction. Friction makes the ball spin and put ink on the paper. Friction requires pressure. Pressure requires you pressing down. This results in tiring more quickly and having a harder time writing.   Fountain pens are made for writing.   Ballpoints are made for convenient, quick writing, jotting down a note here or there, a phone number, a name, whatever. They're not for extensive writing.   Another reason to swap to fountain pen or similar (there are these roller ball things that require little pressure too) is nib size. By writing in fatter lines you can mask bad penmanship. You also write larger and it becomes more legible. European or german nibs tend to be on the larger size. A euro Fine nib is like an asian Bold nib. For example: Lamy, german brand, try a medium, Waterman (I think English/french), try a fine/medium. Cross (american), try a fine or medium.   If however you write in a tiny font, an asian extra fine nib may improve your writing. It allows you to write in super duper fine lines, extra small. Namiki, Pilot, Sailor are asian brands I know off the top of my head.   This part"
LifeProTips,"They may not be all that practical depending on your situation, but the best way to keep it cool is to not overload the system in the first place. If you're running multiple intensive programs, try working on only a few (or one) at a time. Also, try taking short rests during working periods and let your computer have a break.   Unfortunately, this might not be possible because honestly, who in this day and age runs a single program at a time? That's ludicrous. So I would do what other people have already suggested: elevate the fan from the surface on which it rests. You can make this more efficient by buying a compressed air can and just spraying the vent hoods in case there was dust or something hindering the grill."
LifeProTips,"Undervolting! You might not be able to do this with your particular laptop, but it has worked wonders for mine (a few years old using an AMD processor).   The idea is that your CPU needs to be supplied with a certain voltage to remain stable at a particular clock speed. There is some variation in the quality of the individual processors in a batch. This is why some people are able to overclock their CPUs more than others--luck of getting a better CPU. Similarly, there are plenty of chips in any given batch that are capable of running at a lower voltage than others. Manufacturers keep the default voltages and clock speeds the same across the board, though.   I used the RightMark CPU Clock to experiment with lower voltages. You can set different voltages for different clock speeds that your computer will automatically choose based on how much speed you need.   Lower voltage = less power = cooler laptop.

I haven't tried one of the cheap ones (which look significantly more portable) but I've got a big one like this that does a great job of dealing with an overheating laptop. That said, it eats up a lot of desk space and isn't portable. Mine is also loud (though that could probably be fixed with some wisely placed lubricant). I would recommend it for gaming and/or a laptop you've effectively relegated to most-of-the-time in one place desktop replacement."

MorbidReality,"I think saying that all religions hurt people is pretty inaccurate. Most religions today arnt violent at all, save for a few radicals (who are too messed up in the head to even understand what religion is). Though I suppose when you consider the whole Christian vs Gay Rights thing its a different perspective, but even non religious people hurt others out side their community. It's just how people are, if anything it gives people a way to stick together and teaches them a way to cope with the world. The largest religions are all pretty tolerant(besides most Islam), it brings people together, no matter how ridiculous the religion seems to others.   Also saying that it hasn't progressed isn't exactly true. With each generation the religion modifies and adapts. Sure, we follow the basic guidelines that were set thousands of years ago but todays Christianity is very different than back when it started. Then it was ok to stone and hang people for adultery and pre-marital sex, but now thar just seems ridiculous and completely over the top.   I can't really speak for other religions, but I myself am a Christian and I support gay rights and pro choice(with a few exceptions). And I don't have anything against other religions or atheists as long as they arnt whack job radicals. My long term boyfriend is Atheist and I don't mind at all, I love him to bits for him, not his spirituality.   I'm really bad at deep conversation, sorry. Words are hard."
MorbidReality,"It really makes me wonder about fate when something like this happens. When someone, just out of the blue; decides to mend fences, say things that have been unsaid for far too long, does something unusual that shows how much they love you that means so much more afterwards.  My cousin died far too young. He had been driving really late on a summer night. The body was too decomposed to test for alcohol, but we think he may have had a beer or two that evening. By the looks of it, he started to get real drowsy at the wheel and decided to pull over. It was on a side road, only about a 10 minute drive from his mother's. It was the kind of summer day where it's a scorcher during the day and chilly at night. He reclined his seat, windows shut to keep the bugs out, and tucked in for a short nap.  The cool of the night turned into heat in the morning. With the windows up, he didn't wake as the car turned into an over.  He was missing 4 days before his car was discovered. They had my aunt identify him by his tattoos. The coroner refused to release his body to his wife unless we had him cremated. He refused to let any family are the condition his body was in, where the only recognizable parts were the bloated and stretched tattoos.  That morning he had left a little love not for his wife before leaving. He told her again how much he loved her and how happy he was. How he misses her every time he leaves the house, and how he can't wait to see her when he comes home.  I wonder what condition that little piece of paper is in, because I know for a fact she still carries it with her, and can't even imagine how many times she would have reread it in those days and weeks after his death."
MorbidReality,"Wow.  My mom died on the LOT flight 5055 coming from Poland.  I was 4, my brother was 2.   I picked up the phone that morning (mother's day) because my father was making pancakes and was ecstatic to see my mom.  I remember the person on the line asking for my father.  I gave it to him.   A moment later, he dropped the phone, walked to the other room, and started crying so hard.  I've never seen him cry like that before, or since.  I tried to tell him that it would be OK (I was 4, and had no idea what had happened).  He looked at me for one second and I remember him saying distinctly, "No Eric, it's not".   It's amazing that now, 27 years later, I still remember this more than many other things.   My father has always been unable to talk about it, and he never married again because he "could never find someone like my mom ever again".  I'm grateful I stumbled upon this, and clicked on the wiki link to put some clarity in years of question."
MorbidReality,"They sure don't look very crammed in that picture. It's hard for me to find pitty for these people, maybe they should've thought about it before they committed the crimes they committed and victimized innocent people for their own selfish needs. It's so bad yet the inmates who repeat the offenses and get locked back up keep ending up back inside, that doesn't make much sense. What do these people expect, to go off to some summer camp because lets face it, they are the real victims here they need to be rehabilitated!   And that's not a "Can't do the time, don't do the crime" mentality. This article is full of bias. Hey lets ask a bunch of inmates if they have anything good to say about the place they've been incarcerated at..... of course they are going to paint it out to be hell on earth, when in reality it's no worse than any other prison. But I guess since it's a female prison and the writer decided to put a selfie of an inmate that looks "pretty" to fool the readers into thinking these are innocent females being held against their will. This isn't cruel or unusual, hell some soldiers in places like Afghanistan have it 100x worse than this and you expect me to have pitty for these selfish people? Not going to happen.   The selfishness of prison inmates or former prison inmates is ridiculous, I have several family members who've been incarcerated and they are the biggest self centered people I've ever met. And this point is is rampant in this article, just read this part "It's a hostile environment that seems to get worse by the day Please consider re-opening some programs so we can get out of here and try to become productive members of society."   So basically the inmates want the government to take money away from other programs from people who don't victimize others and give it to them so they aren't bored in prison? It's on you do become a productive member of society, why should others have to suffer so your programs can be funded? Prison isn't meant to be a summer camp with lots of activities to keep you from being bored. Why can't you reevaluate your life once you get out of prison and say, look I'm going to go back to school, maybe enroll in a trade program and get my life straight, I never want to go back to that hellish place. Instead they think it's the burden of the state and tax payers to mold them into productive members of society."

MorbidReality,"Yes, eastern europe was on a path to industrialization, western-style law, and private property, and communism really screwed us over in this regard. The often-quoted hypothesis is that, at the start of the 20th century, Russia was 100 years behind the west, and at the start of the 21st century, it was 200 years behind the west. I agree with the general sentiment of that.   However, your bullshit idealization of Tsarist Russia is just as bullshit as other people's bullshit idealization of the Soviet Union. You think the revolution happened because people were happy? Newsflash: people were not happy, including in Romania. Empathically all of eastern europe prior to the October revolution was vastly socioeconomically unequal, vastly poor, grossly mismanaged by its governments, xenophobic to the point of torture and murder, "unwashed", "uneducated" (I am quoting the great Russian classic here), ruled by an aristocracy that thought more about Paris than its people, overwrought with bureaucracy and police brutality, and just plainly inhumane. These countries were completely ravaged by simultaneous wars with Germany, Japan, the Ottoman Empire. The common people in eastern Europe were having a shitty time. They were just having a better time than in the Stalinist repressions.   > At least there was culture.   Wrong. There were 2 cultures: peasant culture, which hadn't changed since the Mongol invasion and was not considered real culture, and "high culture", which was inaccessible to the common people. Read Walter Benjamin,  The Moscow Diaries . He lauds Soviet museums for not only opening up fancy art and music and shit, which was locked away in rich people's houses, to the people (peasants and commoners were not allowed into museums, I shit you not), but elevating peasant traditions and rituals to the status of real culture - creating peasant museums, community theaters, nationalizing the cultural wealth of the Russian Empire.   Though Soviet socialism was never a viable contender to western ideologies because it completely disregarded personal freedoms, in its first few years it changed the lives of millions of common people - for the better. Lenin built critical railroads, roads, dams, and power stations, and other infrastructure, without which the (extremely rapid) industrialization of Soviet Russia would have been impossible. He instituted women's and minority rights, opened free family planning clinics and schools in a country where most of the population was still going to the village witch for both healing and education. He sent the country's best young specialists to work in places that needed them most (economically, this is contestable, but bear with me) - places that never even saw a doctor before. Don't ignore the vastness of this task considering Russia's size, population density, and its total infrastructural underdevelopment. By the way, the reason Romania has a 99% literacy rate and a decent level of human rights despite its economy being the same size and efficiency as Mexico? Communism."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Well, time to spam my friend's ongoing (well it just started but I think you can see it will be good) series about rocket design!   As for the other stuff, there are tutorials out there and I'm guessing people have already pointed them out ("
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Think of it as being like 2 cars on a circular race track.   The car on the inside (closest to the planet) will move faster than the one on the outside.*   So, set your orbit to be about 2km less than your target and time your launch so that you are 100km or less behind. Once in circular, stable orbit, with careful use of the time speedup you will see the distance decrease. As you get close use low rocket thrust or RCS to adjust your orbit to get on an intercept path. This will mean raising your meters per second to match the object your chasing. At about 10km adjust your orbit so that you  lower  your relative (to the thing your chasing) velocity, otherwise you'll come in too hot and whoosh past. Or hit it, like I do...   I strongly recommend MechJeb and it Rendezvous module for learning what all the relevant numbers mean. You can see in real time what all of your control inputs do to your attempt at docking. When you get the hang of what's happening you might find that you don't need Mechjeb as much.   *Fun thing about orbital maneuvering is that to catch an orbiting object from behind you slow down (moving to a lower diameter orbit) and to let something catch up from behind you speed up (going to a higher diameter orbit)."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Since I didn't know about this subreddit when I first bought ksp, back in  the 0.17 days, I never got a chance to share my first Mun landing. So, if you'll bear with me I'll share with you the story of how I, half drunk, pulled off this momentous beginner feat. I had already failed three previous landings and was quickly loosing patience. My friend sat next to me playing Halo on my xbox. In all honesty I was supposed to have turned off KSP 30 minutes before and join him but I refused to leave my laptop until I was landed on the Mun. The two of us were drinking and by this point I was feeling the buzz. My dinky lander approached the surface and, due to my inexperience with throttle control, bodded up and down as I continuously panicked and gunned the throttle thinking the surface was much closer than it actually was. Eventually I decided to go all in and descended at 10 m/s. My heart raced as I watched the altimeter slowly descend until suddenly. . . it stopped! I panicked, I had no idea what was going on. Had I throttled up too much and begun to ascend? I couldn't have. It took precious seconds of nervous fumbling to realize that the altimeter stopped descending because I had stopped descending. I had landed. I quickly throttled down and breathed one of the biggest sighs of relief in my video game career. Quickly, I decided to grab a picture of the achievement in the only way I knew at the time, my cell phone. I didn't learn the F1 trick till weeks later. So there you have it. Thanks for reliving this little gem of nostalgia with me."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Well, from looking at your design, it appears that your Center of Mass is indeed too far forward compared to your Center of Lift.  This will be compounded as you burn jet fuel because the jet fuel is relatively light but positioned well to the rear: as you burn it off your CoM will shift even farther forward but the total mass of the craft won't be reduced by very much, causing even more unbalance.   I suspect that the radial intakes you have are not actually increasing your intake air at high altitude/velocity as much as you might think, either.  As I understand it (although I haven't tested it in 0.21.x) the radial intakes are low-speed-only intakes, despite their shapes, and only the ram intakes are useful for upper-atmosphere flying.  I could be mistaken, but nevertheless I would recommend using ram intakes because you can close them to reduce drag when you switch over to rockets.   I've flown a design similar to yours, with a similar amount of wing surface but with only one rocket fuel tank instead of two, into orbit.  I think your primary issue is definitely nose-heaviness.  The second tank has brought your CoM very far forward, and added a significant amount of additional mass, so I would suggest enlarging both your main wing and your canard.  Possibly use a delta wing with a small control surface attached to it as your canard.  The goal should be to have your wet (full-of-fuel) Center of Mass marker touching the Center of Lift marker; I like to have the CoL marker half-submerged in the CoM marker.   You may also need to increase your main wingspan by one or two sections.  What's the mass of the rocket fuel, 11 tons total?  And then the other components are, what, about 13 tons?  I'd add at least one more span or delta section to each main wing so that your lift is about equal to your wet mass; this'll make take-offs a little less hair-raising. :)   As far as drag, I'd suggest dropping all the radial intakes and adding at least two more ram intakes and see how that goes.  Also, I'm not sure how much drag wings produce in practice but it appears the center of drag for the wings themselves will be below the Center of Mass, possible causing unnecessary torque.  If possible, try to arrange the main wings symmetrically above and below the centerline to eliminate any possible drag asymmetry there.   A final concern I would have is that you've only got one rocket trying to push over 20 tons of fuel and plane into orbit.  It might be beneficial to increase the number of nozzles you're using, even at the cost of increased mass, to get you out of the atmosphere and into space faster.  I'm not certain that your plane will be able to lift itself up to orbit and circularize before running out of rocket fuel given that it loses some efficiency while in the upper atmosphere."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"See that's you going in for a movie. Not a  bad  movie.   A bad movie is terrible to watch. A  bad  movie is terrible to watch... sober and alone.   Batman and Robin is a  bad  movie because of how serious all the actors take it and because of precisely the reason you hated Iron Sky. It broke your suspension of disbelief because you looked at it and went "What? No. That's silly, stupid and impossible." Depending on how that's calibrated, simply the fact of the way those space battles were done and the subreddit we're in, you might just look at star wars the same way. "banking in a ship? They're slowing down without using retrograde rockets in a vacuum? What the hell are they smoking!?!"   But that's not all that makes a  bad  movie. It needs to be a stupid premise. Going back to Batman and Robin, on first glance it isn't. I mean from the same materials we got Dark Knight Rises, but the execution leaves much to leave desired. The opening sequence just will break your (and I'm going to term this now) wool-o-meter. Let's go into inherent bad movie territory now.   Cult movies can be  bad  movies. In fact that might be one of the reasons as well. Have you ever just sat and watched Rocky Horror Picture Show, by yourself, sober? It's really, REALLY,  REALLY  hard to do, because it's a musical that goes off the rails of good acting, off the cliff of decent plot developments and into the pit labelled "misc". Half way into the movie it changes gears so abruptly that you get whiplash.   But it's one of the biggest cult movies of all time. People go to showings, dressed in character, in groups, and chant out lines and the natural responses based off of them. They're also drunk out of their skulls. The two things are very related.   I'm now going to share something. The three inherent questions of Drama. 1. What is the artist trying to do? The answer to this is usually either "Explore" or "Entertain" or maybe both. Both is a wonderful territory where many classics lie. Both is basically where Joss Whedon lives. (Serenity is a good example. The opening is VERY entertaining. The ending is exploratory.) 2. How well has the artist done it? Classics live on the "very well" end of the scale. This does not have anything to do with production value, or special effects, or actor cred. This is simply "Did you do X?" and "How well did you do X?" 3. Was it worth doing? This is where the common answer with blockbusters is "Well, yeah. Money was good." And you leave it there.   So back to the idea of the  bad  movie, you're stuck with 2 types of producers. 1. The purposeful. Iron Sky is of this category. They went in from the beginning and said "ALRIGHT. We want to take a cheesy idea from the 50's, modernize it and actually TRY. Forget skating by, this is an indie flick. You either make it, and your name in the process, or you don't." Which means 3 question wise for them they're trying 1. Both, 2. As well as they can, and 3. Meh. On the flipside: The accidental. Batman and Robin (it's such a good  bad  movie.) They went out and went "Right. We've got an idea here that looks great on paper and we've got budgets, actors up the wazoo, and award winning fx designers. Whaddya got?" The problem is corners... which brings me back into another lesson on drama, the 6 parts. 1. Plot, 2. Character, 3. Idea, 4. Language, 5. Music, and 6. Spectacle. This order is from most important to least important, and the better it is, the more they all blend. On B&R, Plot had corners cut in the name of spectacle. Characters, you've got Batman who will always be the easiest character to write for (a character has to have a skeleton, a drive. In Batman's case, he is justice. The end. Everything he does draws on that. Sherlock Holmes' skeleton is truth. He wants to know everything. The truth of how everything happened and when he finds one he doesn't know that's when he really kicks it into high gear.) So he's done. Robin has always been kinda an odd one because you really want Batman but not Batman. It goes downhill from there not because of acting (we've got George Clooney as Batman and Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy for Christssake) but because of writing. Mr. Freeze wants to steal diamonds to keep himself cold. Okay, but wouldn't he be more interesting if he was doing it for himself second and his wife FIRST? She should have been his skeleton from the start. So Characters is all a muddled mess. Idea is basically "what's the moral of the story" but not quite moral... it's really another way of saying the first question of drama "What is the artist trying to do?". In this case, money. Nobody is suffering for their art, unless you call missing a rent payment in the mission district of San Francisco by a day, suffering. So they go to the typical glue of hollywood, Spectacle. Everything is spectacle. EVERYTHING. New telescope?!? It's now a giant freeze ray. MAGIC.   If you look at Iron Sky by that means, it's trying too hard. Way, way too hard. But I love it because it  is  trying. The plot IS there. The Characters ARE there. The idea, that's where they went "Bad Movie". But they already have the 2 biggest boxes checked. I got more out of the poor Nazi teacher, hell even the Nazi Mad Scientist, than I EVER did out of Shia Labouf in any of those crappy transformer movies. You could see where he was in his logic, his drive, his flaws. He was human and fluid. And he's a goddamned supporting character on screen for maybe 10 minutes!"
KerbalSpaceProgram,"You don't necessarily need a mainsail, I used the skipper and made a heavy lifter that allows me to go to the moon, minimus, even an attempt to land at Eve (but I crashed on surface due to parachute issues).  Once you make that lower part of the lifter, save it, then work on building a landing craft capable of return to Kerbin, then build a station in orbit of the moon and/or minimus.   The station I build included a small probe and an empty science processing center sent up in my heavy lifter, set in orbit around the mun with fuel to spare. Then I sent up the 3 crew capsule (only 2 crew inside) and put it into orbit around the mun, I docked the two and transferred excess fuel into the first tank, undocked the empty tank.   Finally I sent my lander up with Jeb in it, landed it on the mun, took all my samples, went into mun orbit, docked, Eva to collect samples, stored them in the processing center, then reset the samples.   I can now refuel and unload my samples in my station as I make trips to the surface and back. After I get a bunch stored up I can undock the processing center, move the crew back to their capsule and send them to minimus, while I send the probed processing center back to Kerbin for ungodly science collection."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"The first mission is pretty much a freebie; just make a ship that is just a command pod and launch it.  From the launchpad you can do a crew report, then hop out to do EVA reports and a surface sample.  Note that when you're hanging onto the ladder, you count as flying, so you can get a second EVA report like this.  If you're feeling ambitious, you can flip the pod over and try to roll off the launchpad for double science, since KSC and the launchpad are technically separate biomes.  When you're done, just recover the craft.   This should net you enough science for the first node, and possibly a second.  If you can afford a second node, my personal inclination is to spend it on survivability to get the LV-909, but you'll be getting all 3 shortly, so this is pretty much down to personal preference.   Now it's time for our first real launch.  Rather than try something super ambitious right off the bat, this mission is just a standard orbital flight.  The rocket design isn't really important as long as it can get to LKO and has at least 2 goo pods, a pod that can return safely and an antenna.  Fly up to LKO, grabbing the "flying" and "upper atmosphere" crew reports on the way up and transmitting them immediately.  One of the big limitations at this point is the lack of solar panels, so your engine is your only power generation.  If by the time you reach the upper atmosphere you've already turned off your engine, hang onto the crew report instead of transmitting it.   Once you're out of the atmosphere, circularize and take your first goo sample.  If you still have a crew report from the launch, EVA to grab it, then get back in the pod.  Do a crew report, grab it as well, and then it's time to start collecting EVA reports.  You can get one EVA report from each of Kerbin's biomes, listed [here](  The Ice Caps and Tundra biomes are probably out of reach unless you've launched in a very inclined orbit, and I usually have trouble finding Badlands as well.   Once you've gotten all the EVA reports you think you can, the next stop is high Kerbin orbit.  Raise your apoapsis to above 250 km, preferably enough above that to give you time to comfortably do all your science-y things (~275 km is fine).  Crew report, EVA report, second goo pod, grab everything (including both goo reports) and climb back in.  Burn retrograde to reenter.  Once you're safely on the ground, you can grab EVA reports, a crew report and a surface sample, and then recover.   This should net you a few hundred science; enough to start getting some real parts.  The only really essential node for now is the Science Tech node, which will unlock the material bay and batteries.  You might be able to make it to solar panels at this point, which will come in handy.  If you can't you can just spam batteries instead. =)   The next mission is going to take us out of Kerbin's SoI very briefly.  You're probably going to want ~6 km/s of deltav, 3 each of the science jr.'s and goo pods, and either solar panels or plenty of batteries.  Launch to a circular orbit, and then get ready to head to the Mun.  You're going to want to set up a Munar intercept that flings you out into Kerbol orbit.  If at all possible, get your Mun periapsis below 60 km, preferably down to about 10 km.  As you fly by, grab the science from the Mun (you know the drill by now).  You can get separate experiments from above and below 60 km, and when you're below 60 km, you can get EVA reports from different biomes, just like on Kerbin.   Once you've been tossed into Kerbol orbit, grab the science from there and it's time to head home.  Generally, I find you can just point yourself at Kerbin and turn on your engines to get back rather than messing with orbital maneuvering.  Just be sure to keep some backup fuel to get back to a suborbital trajectory once you're back in Kerbin's SoI.   The fourth mission is where most of the science comes from.  You should have enough science by now to unlock docking ports and the science lab, and then aim for Minmus.  Build a craft with a command module with a science lab that'll stay in orbit and a lander with science parts.  The lander only needs about 500 m/s of deltav to land and return.  You  will  need solar panels for this, but that shouldn't be a big deal either.  Landing in each biome on Minmus and getting crew/EVA reports, material studies, goo studies and temperature readings from each one will get you >2000 science, which should be enough to get you most of the way through the tech tree.   EDIT: Sorry, I forgot to mention: for the Minmus mission, you'll be using the science lab to clean your experiments between landings.  You'll need to have at least 2 kerbals aboard to do this."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Not really as much as you might think. Life sport mods for example are calculated with levels that make two way trips to far off planets possible with a moderate amount of stockpiling resources. A trip to the moon and back by comparison to say a tour of Jool takes only a tiny amount of ingame time and associated life support requirements.   Actually flying the lander around the moon collecting science, or making a few dozen orbits of the moon consumes less time and strain on the life support than even a tiny fraction of the travel time between planets."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Wouldn't need the diagram, that's just the back of the panel cover that tells you how and where to set zones, if it is zone doubling capable, power polarity, ect.  Installers have a special code that they use and can bypass nearly any system (Ademco Boards). I reality very few installers use the (basic and simple) preventative measures such as EOL resistors, removing installer code, ect.   On the other hand, if the system has a BAT or CBAT, they'll get an alarm regardlessly. If the owner is just relying on a closed system with no outside communication or uses a phone line, they are just begging to be broken into.     In reality though, most of my clients simply allow me to the panel and security system simply by telling them I'm with security and carrying my tool bag.  When we were doing a job that had the panel right behind the door to the office (where a large drop safe was located, which we were securing), we had a ladder by the door and someone with the door cracked and looking out to make sure nobody came in and knocked over the ladder.  One of my contractors joked that we came in and got access by saying "security" (commonly done by security companies), we have a person on "lookout" by the door, and we have power tools running - for all they knew we were robbing the place.   As always after the job we talked to the front counter about verifying out identity, in which they blushed and only asked for ID. Colorado ID in another state -  they just said "you're good".   Sometimes the best alarm systems can be foiled by an employee not knowing to check identification."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"Amazing.  Now I'm not saying it's the best thing for playing games (since I can't - it's only a RT) but combining the cost ($160) and ability as well as the design, durability, and even with RT the OS stability and usefulness (I use it as a Mobile POS and media center) it's an absolute surprise for me.   I usually use a Toughbook CF-30 and CF-31 for on-site work, and a CF-U1 as a mobile POS system. I was always weary of using a slate, since when I turned to an iPad it broke within the first 3 months (screen impact). An iPad 1 Gen1, but it left me with a bias against tablets in the field.  this one is durable, the battery is decent - 5 - 7 hours with netflix streaming over wifi, 7-10 hours on full volume music. The sound is good as a music device overall, amazing for a tablet. IMO better than the iPad. It is a 4 speaker system I believe.  Charger is nice, I'm getting used to the magnetic clip types.   The pseudo-OS is still impressive, and although no ability to filter out which apps are not supported for RT on the search function basic apps work great. Compared to another Surface Pro 2 I tried out for 14 days (because Best Buys return policy is 15) it's actually more stable - the Pro had issues with correct screen orientation (got stuck several times on a specific rotation), memory issues (although because it is capable of attempting to run programs requiring more resources than available, whereas RT limits to apps designed and capable of being run for/on RT), and general operation.   Overall I prefer the RT over a Pro, because of the much lower cost and because I use it for some of the most basic functions."
KerbalSpaceProgram,"A lot of people seem to be under the impression that career mode is supposed to be the "ultimate" way to play the game. It's not supposed to be better. It's supposed to be different.   To me, career is where I get to struggle with the challenge of building the expensive orbital infrastructure and fanciful "cool" missions that  I  would like, while balancing it with a budget set by outside forces with entirely different ideas and agendas. Much like how every space agency have to limit their awesome projects by what other people are willing to pay for. This is not everyone's cup of tea, and that's perfectly fine. This is exactly why sandbox and science mode exists. There are plenty of ways in this game in which one can find challenge and enjoyment. For some, just getting into orbit is more than enough challenge, and for them to struggle with funds is just abuse. For those like me who do orbital assembly of multi-destination interplanetary missions while half asleep and eyeball our maneuvers without bothering with the nodes, mere exploration doesn't cut it any longer. This is where mods, career and/or self-imposed restrictions come into play.   That said, career does need a lot of rebalancing, which Squad readily admits to, and is working on for 1.0."

3DS,"So here was my only problem with this game, and new Mario games for that matter....they have gotten way too easy... Don't get me wrong, this was the first game I bought for my 3DS and I loved it (hardly put my 3DS down for awhile) but I just feel Mario games have gotten so easy lately. 10 levels into it and it's almost impossible not have 50 lives. And then from there smooth sailing. No I haven't 100%'d the game but I played all the way through and never ran into a level/bowser that I was like "I can't beat this". I know they appeal to a younger crowd as well now but where was that thought process with some of the original Mario games? When I was 5 playing Super Mario World it was the hardest shit ever!"
3DS,"The day that nintendo stops making money off their handhelds because of phone gaming is the day the earth freezes over.

People are silly lol."
3DS,"I was really dissapointed in Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon. I hated the quest system and the way the game pulls you from mansion to mansion just feels forced. That's not to say that it's not a good game, it is, it just doesn't feel the original in all the ways that made it fun."

Cascadia,"Long story short: Private ownership of resources and business for profit will always lead to those owners doing what makes them the most profit, which often comes at the expense of the people and environment. Look at the constant fight cascadia is currently engaged in with the fossil fuel industry, which, with it's vast resources, could almost certainly switch to renewable energy, but don't do so because fossil fuels are still more profitable."
NCSU,"I don't really agree with that statement.   Many of these "honor societies" don't really do much and are indeed just interested in getting your money.  Fine.  Point taken.  But it's not exactly difficult to tell which ones are active and which ones are not.   I joined an honor society at State (which I paid $85 for) that hosted meetings with speakers every semester, did service projects on a regular basis, and provided social events for members.  It was not NSCS.   To OP, joining an honor society is not about the scholarships.  Plenty of other organizations offer those.  I can't offer an opinion on NSCS because I'm not a member, but finding those who are is the best way to find out what they do and if you think your time and money are worth it.   My personal advice is to join a departmental/college honor society or professional society instead of a university-wide one."
SEO,"I'm the SEM/SEO manager for an ecommerce company that does almost 200 million annually. I've been on the other end of the presentations and here's some stuff i would look for.   Siegoboy's comments are really good if the company is starting SEO from scratch.   For a company that's been actively building their SEO, i think you want to provide more details on the value added you provide.   Identify problem points in their SEO efforts and talk about the current environment. Don't rip them apart, because you want to make them feel positive as well, but talk about what you can do to contribute. Saying 'We want to start this from scratch! or We want to re-do this" basically = lots of work or lots of money and taking steps backwards and that the guy in charge of the program (the one who will be hiring you) is incompetent. More likely, he/she/they will understand where you're coming from but will have a different idea of where priorities should lie. Unless something they're doing is completely wrong, don't offer to redo anything. Ie, blogs, content, URL structure. Rather - try to add to what they're doing instead (unless it's a complete mess).   If they are doing 100 million, then they have other systems tied to the site and there are other factors that are preventing them from improving their site or it's a bigger job than you think because other departments will need to get involved. Ie. content could reside in IT instead of marketing or vice versa meaning they have to go through gatekeepers to get changes implemented. Simple changes like title tags etc which would take a few mins on a smaller site could take weeks to get done on a larger company's site.   Although, you shouldn't guarantee any performance (because that will just raise flags), set goals based on what you think you can accomplish. Whether that is traffic goals, conversions, ranking etc. - is up to you. This will help them get an idea of what they will get back on their investment. In the end SEO is another channel. Most people understand it takes time to see results from SEO but visually showing what the forecasted growth will look like is something i request in all my RFPs. This forecast and the tactics used to get there are what i look at most closely when i am looking at proposals from agencies.   Talk about some of the tactics you will be using to get to your proposed forecasts and try to get into some detail. Ie. don't just say link building $1000 - say linkbuilding allocating this amount of funds into content creation, this much into getting X number of high PR sites per month, X number of mid PR sites, and $X into directories or whatever.   Don't worry about the company taking your ideas and running with it themselves. if they're this large, they have the resources to do everything in-house if they wanted to but it's not worth the resources they will need to put into it. Hiring an agency will allow them to implement and hit the ground running rather than building it up internally.   If they're new to SEO, offer a site audit to kick things off and make this a big part of the presentation because it will highlight your expertise and also show where their investment is going.   If they are SEO veterans, mention the site audit outlining what's involved but don't make a big deal out of it. Chances are they've done/had numerous audits and another one will just look like a waste of time.   Realize that a site that does $100 million will be slow to act. There's going to be release cycles, and other projects that are bigger priority than SEO so factor that into your recommendations and projects.   Low hanging fruit is very attractive - so make sure you highlight those. Things that you can implement quickly (sometimes site related, but off-site might be better if they will be slower to make changes).   Offering to take on some of the on-site work is very attractive but can also backfire. This usually means opening up code and dev environments to your team which may be backlash on from those who manage those areas.   I'm sure there's more stuff but this reply is"
vim,"Filedump: just unpack everything into  .vim . I.e. no "management" at all. You don't want that.   Vimball: kind of like selfextracting archives for Vim ( .vba ). Big downside: they all install in the .vim root, so uninstallation is rather difficult. "Not recommended" is an understatement.   Pathogen: looks in  .vim/bundle  and autoloads all plugins that are subdirectories there. Package management is either manual or nowadays usually through git submodules: Pathogen is only a plugin loader, not a plugin manager. The only advantage over Vimball / filedump method is separation of plugin directories (however, it is a hefty and quite significant advantage).   Vundle: looks in  .vim/bundle , loads plugins you specify in  .vimrc  (e.g.  Bundle "tpope/vim-sensible"  would autoload the plugin in  .vim/bundle/vim-sensible ). However, it also serves as a package manager: given the line above, Vundle will automatically install vim-sensible from its GitHub repository (under user  tpope ). It can also automatically remove plugins that are not defined in  .vimrc . Thus, your  .vimrc  becomes your one-stop destination for declaring your Vim configuration. It can also specify a subdirectory in a repo as the root plugin directory, something you can't do in Pathogen (given Pathogen does not really accept any configuration).   NeoBundle: fork of Vundle. Same as Vundle, but better, allowing lazy loading triggered by commands, filetypes or keypresses (e.g. load  fugitive  only when  :Git  or  :Gwrite  etc are issued) to cut down on startup time, more kinds of repositories, and other improvements (bigger list on NeoVundle pages)   EDIT: Vim-Plug, that I know next-to-nothing about, but appears similar to NeoBundle in some respects.   EDIT2: VAM (Vim-Addon-Manager), that I know as well as Vim-Plug. Thanks, /u/unglr.     I'm a fan of NeoVundle, even if you do need to write some configuration. Some people prefer Pathogen though, since it is so simple (or rather, deceptively simple - in order to use it effectively, you really should understand how to manage git submodules well)."

BSG,"This could all be part of a cylon infiltration, but my intuition is that during all of his work with dna Dr. Hatake discovered the cylon half of our genetic code. I think he realizes that human beings are a sophisticated mix of at least two races and I think he wants to fully activate that cylon half and delete the human part in order to create a lifeform that is 100% cylon.   That's... that's even more amazing than the idea that the Cylons came back and started all this! I really hadn't thought about a scenario other than active Cylon infiltration, so this all happening because of human curiosity makes it even better, in my opinion, because it allows the series to be grounded on Earth rather than force the necessity of the return of the Centurion type of Cylons. That also means it doesn't stray into the whole F"
Chattanooga,"The only rock stations in Chattanooga nowadays are KZ-106 (a limited variety of classic rock), Rock 105 (which plays alternative but more on the harder side of the spectrum), and 93.3 (which is a Jack.fm station, a.k.a. a disc jockey-less variety of rock and pop hits from the last few decades).   Chattanooga used to have two good rock radio stations: The Mountain (which played mostly current and 90's alternative rock with some 80's and classic rock thrown in for good measure) and The WAWL (which was Chattanooga State's radio station which played indie music with lots of eclectic theme shows throughout the week). The Mountain became a Top 40 station and The WAWL sold their frequency and went online only. About the time those two events happened, I switched to satellite radio. About a year ago when I got a new smartphone, I dropped the satellite and switched to Internet radio."

Aleague,"apologies, this became longer than planned)   John Duerden recently [touched on]( the DPRK's recent policy of sending young talent overseas.   Their squad for the AC features [two players based in Switzerland and two in Japan](   If you're wondering how on earth DPRK players are in the J-League, both were born in Japan and chose to take North Korean citizenship, which children of North Korean passport holders are allowed to do.   Jong Tae-se  followed a similar path, but he can't be called up for the national team as he's currently playing in South Korea and that's apparently too wide a river to cross.   4 internationally-based players out of 22 is still better than, say, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, or China (none), Oman (1) or Kuwait (2), but of course it's nowhere close to Australia (16 out of 23) or South Korea (18 out of 23).   I don't think it's a matter of whether or not North Korea has talented players capable of playing in Europe, because they surely do. It's more an issue of the various political/ideological obstacles and how those affect the decisions of the clubs and leagues.   Besides practical matters such as where the players' salaries end up (are they being funneled back to NK? Is that legal in whatever jurisdiction they're in? Is their translator a DPRK minder? Who the hell knows), there are deeper issues at play.   From the DPRK's perspective, you have players who have consumed the  juche  Kool Aid (look at Tae-se as an example). Put them into a European locker room next to stars who wear fancy watches, drive expensive cars, and embody everything the DPRK government claims to oppose... and what happens?   Or maybe those players have been trained and conditioned to deal with those circumstances, like Soviet spies, forbidden from talking to their teammates about what they've seen. Or the DPRK government tolerates them straying from the path in the name of sporting glory, much like the Church of Scientology gives Tom Cruise a long leash.   In the end it's the DPRK FA, and by extension their government, who are making the decisions here. But the country's international success in 2014 hopefully inspires them to take further steps along that line, and with [Rimyongsu Sports Club]( finishing runners-up in the AFC President's Cup maybe we'll see their clubs participating in the AFC Cup in a few years."
recht,"Ich wollte eigentlich Philosophie und Rechtsgeschichte als Schwerpunkt w盲hlen. Nach einer Abw盲gung, in der ich versucht habe alle relevanten Entscheidungskriterien zu ber眉cksichtigen, bin ich dann allerdings auf 脰ffentliches Recht als Schwerpunkt gekommen. Ich werde die Entscheidungsfindung im Folgenden nachvollziehen. Vielleicht hilft es ja jemandem, dem "follow your heart" etwas zu flach erscheint.   Als Kriterien habe ich ber眉cksichtigt: pers枚nliches Interesse, Arbeitsaufwand, Notenerwartung, Examensrelevanz.     Das pers枚nliche Interesse f眉r Philosophie und vor allem Geschichte ist durchaus vorhanden. Allerdings war ich mir insbesondere in der Philosophie nicht sicher, ob ich mit den an meiner kleinen bayerischen Provinzfakult盲t vertretenen Lehrmeinungen und -methoden gl眉cklich geworden w盲re.     Das pers枚nliche Interesse, im Sinne von Leidenschaftlichkeit, f眉r 脰ffentliches Recht h盲lt sich doch stark in Grenzen. Allerdings arbeite ich an einem Lehrstuhl f眉r 脰ffentliches Recht und habe ein Auslandsjahr damit zugebracht 脰ffentliches Europarecht zu studieren. Habe damit also eine Ausrichtung im Lebenslauf.     Der Arbeitsaufwand ist in beiden Schwerpunkten nicht ohne. In Philosophie und Rechtsgeschichte muss man sehr viel lesen. In 脰ffentlichem Recht hat man die gr枚脽te Menge an Gesetzestext von allen F盲chern.     Man sagt, dass man in Philosophie gute Noten bekommen kann. Allerdings sitzen da auch ein paar Philosophie- diehards  im Kurs, die sicherlich nicht wenig f眉r die Note tun. Geschenkt bekommt man die gute Note dort auf keinen Fall. In 脰ffentlichem Recht ist der Notendurchschnitt etwas niedriger, bei aber niedrigerer Durchfallquote, was daf眉r spricht, dass sich mehr Noten im Mittelfeld konzentrieren und es statistisch weniger Ausrei脽er nach oben und unten gibt. Als Student, der eher dem Mittelfeld zuzuordnen ist, bringt es nichts danach auszusuchen, in welchem Schwerpunkt die besten Noten geschrieben wurden.     Die Examensrelevanz von Philosophie und Geschichte ist gleich Null. In 脰ffentlichem Recht werden 2 der 6 Klausuren geschieben. In Strafrecht wird nur eine geschrieben. In den meisten zivilrechtlichen Schwerpunkten kann man sich nicht sicher sein ob sein Thema 眉berhaupt dran kommt. Familienrecht, Arbeitsrecht, Erbrecht etc. wird meist nur in jedem zweiten Termin 眉berhaupt abgefragt. 脰ffentliches Recht kommt auf jeden Fall dran. Insbesondere Vorlesungen wie Verwaltungsprozessrecht vertieft und Verwaltungsverfahrensrecht vertieft sind gold wert, da sie in quasi jedem Examen relevant sind. Der Arbeitsaufwand f眉r die Examensvorbereitung verk眉rzt sich damit auf dem Bereich des 脰Rechts enorm, wenn man vorher den Schwerpunkt absolviert hat, da Examens- und Schwerpunktstoff weitestgehend deckungsgleich sind.       Bisher habe ich meine Wahl nicht bereut. Insbesondere f眉r jene, die ihren Schwerpunkt vor dem Examen machen wollen, kann ich die strategische Wahl empfehlen."
baylor,"I would seriously doubt you would make the team, the players are ridiculous and it is because they have all probably played at a high level their entire life and in high school.   However, I know that Soccer is a club team, so that may mean that you can still participate in someway.  So, if you are at all interested, contact them and see what you need to do.   To put it in perspective, I tried to walk-on the tennis team my freshman year.  I played tennis my whole life and played at a very competitive high level on my high school team as well as year round, high-level tournament play.  I contacted the coach and he basically said, "show up at the time and day with your rackets and ready to play and we'll see."  So, I did.  And so did about 60 other people.  The coach then told us that he doesn't have time to evaluate us all so we will all play a tournament, to completion that day and MAYBE he will take one of us.  And he immediately put us in a bracket, left it with an intern, and away we went.  I sailed through pretty easy until the semi finals.  That match, I barely won, like 6-4, 6-3.  Then I played the finals and got absolutely rocked, 6-0, 6-1.  The coach took the kid who beat me."
linux4noobs,"More specific questions would be easier to answer but here I will try to tell you what I can.  Note: I am only a sophomore engineering student, not a full-time engineer or programmer.   caallen is right, Terminal on your Mac will work very much the same as the Terminal in linux.  This is because they are both based on Unix.  But to really get a feel for linux, the best thing to do is actually play around with it.  If you have a USB stick available, you can run linux off of that without having to actually install the OS.  very useful for trying out new distros (different kinds or versions of linux). Get the ISO (the OS itself) [here]( and [this]( will walk you through making a bootable USB stick.   Using a virtual machine is something I have never done, so I don't know how easy or hard it is.  It could be very useful if 1) your computer has decent hardware (would not recommend if you have a MacBook Air) and 2) you don't want to have to reboot to do something in the other OS.   Otherwise, all I really know about Pi's is that they use a different processor architecture than does your computer (look up CISC v RISC), so you can't compile a program that both works on your computer and the Pi (without an emulator, but that's a whole other bag of worms).  On the other hand, if the plan is to write scripts (with a language like Python), should be no problem.   Tell me if any of that was confusing or if you have any other questions, even if you feel like they are silly."
EDC,"I carry Sabre defense spray when I'm going out for walks. It's small and attatches to my key chain but when I'm out I have it detatched. I didn't use to carry anything but when I walk I don't always stay to the gentrified areas. It may not have the stopping power of a gun or taser but in my area your biggest concern is generally being an easy target. I don't look like an easy target and if someone or a gang of people approach me a circular spray would likely deter most of them or at least make the numbers more even. At the very least it will stall and give me time to get away and can't be used against me to kill me."

I was nervous that he would blame me for pushing him to get an Osprey. However, when he contacted Osprey about a repair, they took care of everything for free and had it done in no time. 5 years later and he loves his pack with no further troubles! Also, I broke a buckle after 3 years ownership. Sent a picture to Osprey's website of the buckle and they sent me 2 at no charge within 3 days!"
SSBM,"Actually i think 3 is the magic number.  Being able to mix up a triple shine grab vs a a normal shine grab is more helpful than a double shine.   Its obviously extremely situational but frame wise its fairly important.   I don't mean to  try and call you out or anything but i was talking frame data with someone a few days ago and this came up"
SSBM,"That's just what I've been doing tho. Basically there isn't really a way to 'theorycraft' how stuff is going to happen. You can study all the top games and practice all the tech but the fact of the matter is you gotta play vs. some people (preferably people better than you) get stomped and learn. Once you do that it gets a bit easier, I think people are a lot more receptive to giving contructive criticism once they see you have decent fundamentals.   I can't speak for everyone but I don't really want to get super detailed in helping someone who lost and probably wont come back because it's wasted time. The more people you play and the more tournaments you go to the more help you will get from people who see that you are trying to improve."
SSBM,"I mostly know what I'm doing that's NOT working, but I'd like ideas on what I SHOULD be doing. (i.e. I dash attack too much but what should I replace it with?) I know boost grab is something I need to be able to perform more consistently but what else? I really feel like my neutral game leaves a lot to be desired. How can I deal with DD camping? Just needle camping? Should I strictly be forcing approaches instead of approaching myself?   I think at this point you can't really just look at the game as a series of options that you use or don't use. Your movement where it's at right now simply doesn't give you many options. Sheik has a pretty short dash length, so whenever you run i've noticed you pick one of 4 options: dash attack/boost grab/jump/roll which becomes very linear and predictable. If you work on anything, work on your movement. For example if you learn how to wavedash you can wavedash back from your dash, which can open up your tilt game. So before you get into the technicalities, you can do a bunch of movement drills. Start with learning how to wavedash back, then wavedash out of shield. Learn to shffl if you haven't already(you play pm so I assume you can do this). Then you can mix it up. Try to dash forward, wavedash back and dash forward again. Watch videos of sheik players and learn how to combine your dashes and wavedashes to improve your movement game."

It's like i want to push them away so that I will never have to deal with the pain of rejection. the pain of knowing that the person whom i trust most wants to be rid of me.   It's like doing something bad, but taking it into your own hands. you ever heard of a parent telling their kid the family dog died? how the parents feel if must come from them? it's the same as this.   The people i care the most about are the ones i find myself wanting to push away. there are only two people whom i consider on this level of intimacy(friendship?). look at it like a complement, a test to show her how much you  really  love her."
ptsd,"Big disclaimer: I'm not an expert on any of this. Not statistics, medicine, or clinical research. I just have institutional access, a possibly unhealthy degree of curiosity, and a little time on my hands.   I don't understand all the statistical voodoo they did with the study, but it looks fairly thorough considering what they had to work with. First, their methods. They examined 253 veterans between 2000 and 2003 "upon entering Gulf War Screening and PTSD Programs at the Cincinnati Veterans Affairs." They didn't track them over time, but instead took psychological and physiological data, then ran that through statistical models. One benefit they got, at least, was that they had a natural control group among the veterans who scored <20 on CAPS.   I don't understand Wald statistics, which is the measure they used, so I'm not totally clear on just how strong the correlation is except relative to other correlations. But it looks like a very strong correlation - PTSD severity managed to beat age as a risk factor and was only exceeded by gender:   > As with our previous investigation, being older (Wald= 3.86, p= 0.050, OR= 1.03), male gender (Wald= 4.84, p= 0.028, OR= 0.17) and higher PTSD severity as represented by the CAPS total score (Wald= 4.04, p= 0.044, OR= 1.01) were significantly and uniquely associated with higher metabolic syndrome risk. Antipsychotic medication use, however, did not appear to be a significantly unique predictor of metabolic syndrome (Wald= 0.30, p= 0.587, OR= 1.25) when in context of the selected predictors (including severity of PTSD).   A Wald of 0 means no correlation, so that's really low for the antipsychotics. However, it has a ridiculously high p-value, roughly the chance of getting that result from purely random variables even if the result isn't true. p=0.587 roughly means only 41.3% certain of that result. I figure this is because only 33 of their participants were on antipsychotics. It was fairly low with CAPS score (95.6% certain, roughly speaking), but still just barely below the standard cut-off of p<=0.05 to be confident in the finding.   However, that doesn't mean this is useless. In fact, it largely corroborated [a study they referenced]( comparing  only  patients on antipsychotics but with different diagnoses:   > Overall, the prevalence rates of metabolic syndrome were 72% in patients with PTSD, 60% in those with schizophrenia, 58% in those with mood disorder, and 56% in those with dementia.   Back to the paper under discussion, they ran a bunch of regression models to pick out significant predictors of metabolic syndrome:   > Based on the bootstrap analysis, age was a significant predictor of metabolic syndrome status (significant in 30% of the 1000 replications), followed by lifetime nicotine abuse or dependence (21%), and history of substance use or dependence (19%) and PTSD (14%). Antipsychotic medication status was significant in 8% of the replications.   I think the results here are a bit different from above because the first ones were correlations and these ones are predictions from running statistical simulations.   They recognize the shortcomings of the study and make specific recommendations for future research as well as, I think, a good reason it should be looked at:   > The health-related impacts of PTSD are widespread and significant. The risk of metabolic syndrome in a treatment seeking veteran population appeared to be better accounted for by severity of PTSD than by antipsychotic medication use. However, a longitudinal study is strongly recommended to understand the role of PTSD severity and antipsychotic medication use over time on development of metabolic syndrome. Future research directed toward improving and disseminating treatments for PTSD needs to incorporate measures of biological burden (such as metabolic syndrome) to quantify the risks and benefits of such treatments on the physical health of those living with chronic PTSD."

latterdaysaints,"I have such a difficult time listening to people bagging on the historicity of the BoM. We can barely get our own history accurate from a couple hundred years ago. We look at history through a lens of modern times and culture by what was preserved historically, and it relies on so much speculation - even many of the New Testament places are in question because of the lack of preservation and records of those places. Jump into the Americas 2000 years ago and the grey area becomes nearly black. Shoot - turn on the news and tell me how accurate any of that is - and it's stuff happening now. We have faith in the historians, we have faith in the news - what about faith in God?   DNA evidence you say? There's also a ton of faith in science that leans on this. Science is about as fickle as a kid in a toy store. Todays "knowledge" is tomorrows "Ok, we know more now, so that wasn't really accurate" (  Big Bang, anyone? . Not to mention we have to really believe that most of the population of the Americas were primarily descendants of Lehi, which we don't believe (even in the BoM Church's heyday, about 3,000 people joined the Church that year - we aren't talking mass quantities of people here). If I put on my tin foil hat, I could go down a rabbit hole of conspiracies out there that suggest that the true history of the Americas is actively hushed (  Mound builders? . But unless we are doing the research for ourselves, we have actively put our faith in the historians and the scientists here, no room for error. I'll just put my faith where I strongly believe I already received a witness of the validity of the Book of Mormon, and that faith is in God."

Maybe it was because I liked the logo too, but nonetheless, I started watching them when I could and before long I was watching every game by the time i was 8th grade.

bigboobproblems,"I used to be a costume maker, and I had a few BBP's   It was my first time making a costume from scratch as opposed to collating parts of a costume. I had two actresses I was making dresses for, one was busty, one was not.   I took about 6 times longer to make the smaller girls dress because I had to remeasure about 1000 times. I kept looking at the pattern going "No, that can't possibly fit a human being" then I would check, and low and behold it was right, so I would cut the fabric and look at it, then freak out thinking 'I've made a mistake, the bust is too small!" so I would check the measurements and realise that I hadn't made a mistake.   This went o through every stage of the costuming, then when first fittings rolled around, It turned out that I'd made the bust a good 4" too big for her anyway. She was confused by my mistake because the dress was perfect everywhere else, so I tried to save myself by saying "we haven't got your costume bra yet, also, you know how fickle hormones can be, I tend to take the bust in toward the end of production"   Then we took the girls bra shopping because there were scenes where they were shirtless and they needed a costume bra. I'm very strict about having the actors come with me for costume bra's because I want them to get the right fit. I was not surprised when busty actress was a 28G, But she sure as hell was, poor girl was wearing 36C's her whole life.   Then smaller chested girl got fitted and came out as a 30B, and I was like "is that a real size? did I measure her wrong?".   I had other issues too, not problems but just personal obstacles to overcome. As a wardrobe attendant there are OHS rules that govern how we wash actors underwear. everything must be placed in wash bags by the actors themselves, then we machine wash them. I had to teach myself not to cringe each time I was forced to put bra's into the washing machine.   The hardest thing was having to wait until I clocked out to approach actresses "as a friend" to let them know that their personal bra's made me cry, and to please let me take them bra shopping."

linux,"I both agree and disagree with you.  Many people don't think about performance when writing applications.  On the PC, that's partially a good thing - not that they don't care, but that they don't have to.  It's great that today, people can spend more time building applications, and adding features than squeezing every bit of performance out of them.  It means better software, because we can do things the simplest way.  It means more software, more features, more eye candy, etc.  Part of the reason we have 4GB of RAM is this.  That RAM is there to be used.  Firefox uses absurd amounts of RAM, but on the other hand, RAM is cheap, and optimization isn't.   Obvious the phone is a different animal and performance is much more constrained.  However, embedded processors are at the point where they are reaching performance levels of a few years old PC.  We are now fabbing quad-core >1GHz ARM parts that have some serious power, and phones with more RAM than some people have in their PCs.   Second, the higher-level language actually alleviates some of the problems you mention.  Don't have to worry about someone mallocing MBs of memory, because it's abstracted by the language.  Or cleaning it up, or preventing memory fragmentation.  That's all handled automatically.  Check some benchmarks for C# and Java.  They are nearly as fast as C/C++ and faster than some compiled languages.  JIT is seriously fast because you are running mostly or all native code.  Also, on Android, some libraries are native.  Graphics, for instance (according to Google's Dalvik JIT seminar) is native, so graphically intense applications are suffering little even under the pre-JIT Dalvik interpreter.   > My old flip phone had a calculator, calendar, ring tones, T9 txt, etc. It took maybe 5 seconds to 'boot up' and maybe 2 to shut down.   While Android's boot is slow and the UI lags on 1GHz or slower single core parts (which IS unacceptable), I never had any phone, smartphone or not boot in 5 seconds.  You also have to realize the difference.  Android is a full Linux system, with tons of services, and background stuff.  It's a very flexible system.  Your non-smartphone can not do anywhere close to the things that Android can do.  Any system that runs on a variety of devices is going to have bloat, because there are things that are specific to some devices that need to be included, in addition to the abstraction needed to allow that.  You could probably build the same UI to run in 1/10th the resources, but you wouldn't be able to install apps, and it wouldn't run on the amount of phones Android runs on.  Consider how awful J2ME apps where in the pre-smartphone days.   > It went a week on a charge.   The screen uses  far  more battery than any other component.  Android phones have much bigger, and brighter screens than those other phones, which of course means you'll use it more, using more of those resources.  I too think this is unacceptable, and would gladly buy an Android device that's a little thicker and < 4" in exchange for 2 solid days of battery life.   > Basically we've taken a huge hit in usability for the sake of making it easier on the programmers.   I know what you mean, but usabilty refers to ease of use.  I don't think you mean it's harder to use, but less responsive, which is true.  Flexibility comes at a cost...either more expense, slower, or needs way more power.   > Or if you opened your microwave door and it kept going for 3 seconds, what kind of hell would you raise?   The microwave only does one thing...this IS why I don't want a computerized toaster, microwave, fridge or oven.  Also, the microwave's function, cooking, is  not  instant.   > because it's easier than compiling for a few different architectures.   That is very close to what JIT does.  It compiles to all supported architectures, but on your devices, which reduces the original application size, allows more aggressive optimization (otherwise NO apps could use SIMD or floating point, since not all ARM processors support it), and minimal download size, with support for any architecture with no effort from the developer.   > And people have long accepted that you need to reboot windows machines a lot, and that it's performance degrades over time. The number of devices that require a reboot periodically is ridiculous.   Stability on any new system will take time.  Gingerbread is much more stable than earlier versions, and it will get even better.  On 2.3.7, my battery dies far more often that a reboot is necessary, and even Windows is so stable, I can't remember the last time I rebooted a Windows box.   > An emulator is acceptable because it can be optimized per platform and has a fairly constant performance lag when in use.   Emulators are terribly slow, worse than even scripted languages.  In an awful language, take PHP for example, library functions are in native code, so you never notice how slow it is, because most processing-intensive things execute with no overhead.  In an emulator, everything is slow.  Everything must be decoded, translated and executed at the instruction level.   Now, bytecode languages are very similar to emulators, the difference being they are designed for this purpose, and thus execute faster than emulated applications, using much less overhead.  And, they lend well to JIT, which when done correctly (C#), gives a constant performance boost, running at as near native speed as possible on all architectures.   As Android evolves, and the JIT adds more optimizations, it will get faster."

linux,"What applications? Are you talking SIMT or SIMD? I have considerable experience with coding  real  world applications (in customer's hands) for many-core (single die) architectures at this scale and [much] larger. I also write compilers for them. Could you give us an estimate of your current fetch/ALU ratio?   For those who don't know about these devices, let me put it into GPU terms (SIMT only; SIMD is much, much harder to analyze): fetch would correspond to a texture sample, ALU is the work done on the sample. If the arch's fetch/ALU ratio is 1:4, then you need 4 (pure, non loading) arithmetic operations per memory request to keep the part "fed". A ratio as low as 1:4 is only really possible with low clock rate/memory rate ratio, and (nearly pure) SIMT. For instance, a large RT pixel shader on a Radeon 5870 would have numbers like this.   SIMT means "single instruction multiple thread" and refers to totally non-communicating processes. SIMD means "single instruction multiple data", where each lane is allowed to communicate. For instance, the SSE instruction HADD is SIMD, not SIMT, because the lanes of the vector unit "talk". Likewise, gather is SIMT, whereas permute is SIMD.   For many core (single die) devices, another problem is that the workload has to be fairly homogenous across all the ALU [vector] units, or you will starve the units when they thrash the local working set of hot data. This means that for SIMT architectures, it is not just enough to have homogeneous per ALU [vector] work, but also homogeneous workload across the entire device.   This is entirely different from, say, the large scale server x86 boxes. These devices are truly high-throughput serial devices, designed to allow an enormous amount of thrash on the local working set. They do this with high frequency rates, OOO pipes, and staged caches of every (ginormous) sizes, and narrow vector units."
linux,"Not much, unfortunately. Besides work and studies, I've been kept busy developing  LuaRocks .   I still run it in my computers, though, and there's a small community that keeps using it, and  updating our source-based "recipes" .   There have been also some updated images of the system floating around, but none of us actually went all the way to make a finished .iso that we could stamp as a new release.   The iso on the website is seriously outdated -- there are howtos on how to upgrade it after installation, but it's becoming more and more cumbersome, so we eventually  have  to get our act together and pack a new release. It might pop up unexpectedly at any moment, though, but who knows when. I guess a side effect of the qualities of the system is that it just keeps working, so most of us don't bother with radical upgrades anymore. :)"

linux,"Are they paying them back in any way?   Yes. The Elementary OS devs are actively lowering the barrier to entry for Desktop Linux for users and developers.     They've contributed to and use Vala - a programming language that is very similar to Java and C#. Since many recent grads are familiar to these languages, some have been more apt to contribute to the Linux desktop and in turn - Linux's ecosystem.     They've offered [bug bounties](     They've developed a framework called Granite for their OS. Granite aids developers in ways that are more familiar to Windows and OSX devs.     Pantheon is lightweight. It can run on older computers and, it's GUI is more familiar to Windows and OSX users. Pantheon will attract new desktops users with its ease of use and looks. Given the length of Elementary's  beta, I think we can expect it to be a stable distro. As a dev myself, I appreciate ease of use and stability - I don't want to fix broken things when I have other work to do. I don't want to spend time configuring KDE's PIM or Ubuntu's Unity. I don't want to deal with Ubuntu Next. (I'm currently using Ubuntu after going from Suse (in '06?) --> Kubuntu 7.04 - 12* --> Slack/KDE --> Arch/Gnome3 --> Arch/KDE -->, Kubuntu --> Ubuntu 14.04.

linux,"You can't really expect the end user to pay for it" is a sentence that is shunned by everyone endorsing free software (like the FSF), as it is just not true.   You know what else is a sentence that's shunned?  "We want users to understand that they鈥檙e pretty much cheating the system"  when they exercise their copyleft rights .   Encouraging donations is great. Acting like copyleft isn't really a thing? Not so much.   But let's drill down a little further into that.   > elementary is under no obligation to release our compiled operating system for free download.   The catch here is the "compiled" bit - if they want to have users, that's distribution, and if they're distributing, they have to make the  source code  available for free download (edit for clarity: to those users, who may then redistribute the source as far and wide as they see fit).  Now, the kicker here is - as they've stated - they don't have to make the  compiled  code available ( edit for clarity: and the users do not have redistribution rights to those binaries, either - the users only have redistribution rights to object code they compile  themselves , from the source code they do have rights to  edit2:  I was wrong about this .  The catch there is that you can't just download the source and conveniently presto  poof  boot your laptop on elementaryOS.   However, at that point one of two things happens: either somebody compiles and releases a working copy of the distribution themselves - like CentOS does with RHEL - or nobody gives enough of a shit to bother, and their distro goes spiraling down into obscurity and failure.  With elementary, I'd frankly bet on the latter.   It's probably worth noting that eventually  Red Hat acquired CentOS  - and continued its operation, exactly as it was - because despite the natural and understandable discomfort in the relationship, they realized that a CentOS was inevitable, and it was far better for them to own it and operate it on a friendly basis than to risk alienating their paying customers.  How would the paying customers be alienated if CentOS operated poorly, you ask?  Well, if CentOS became unreliable, the bad reputation of CentOS would inevitably tarnish RHEL itself; and if Red Hat tried to banhammer CentOS, they would inevitably anger copyleft activists, which would also end up tarnishing Red Hat's reputation.  So they did the best thing possible - acquire it and make damn sure it operates  properly .   I'm"
linux,"Like kevingoodsell, I disagree.   To be honest, I don't think we should be sending away "noobs" and asking people to always rely on Google.

opieandanthony,"Have to stick up for Vice a bit. Last summer in Romania there were big street protests against Rosia Montana project. In short, an ex heroin dealer and a couple of wall street "investors"  set up a fake company(named "the Gold corporation", seriously)and wanted to start a huge mining project. Problem was ,they were going to pay only 6% on gold only(most experts stated that other more valuable materials were to be extracted), demolish entire archeological sites and towns, and use incredibly shoddy enviromental standards that would see an artificial lake filled with cyanide waste, while the fake corporation would disband and make off with the money. The most disgusting thing was how most of the media was silent about this with some cronies praising this fucking disaster like it was the second coming of Christ. Later it emerged that a lot of media cunts were on payola. Things got critical when a new prime-minister came to power and,hilariously,changed his position 180 degrees from vehemently anti to strongly pro. Then the street protests started by people who had had enough of this shit and weren't about to let the entire country be poisoned by cyanide when the lake gave way. The one street protest that I was part of easily had  60-80000 people marching on the main streets,with a lot of students, families with kids,grandmas and other old fucks etc. Honestly it was the most civilized mass gathering i had ever seen. Yet on the news it was presented as 5000 dirty hippies running around causing trouble(they even used archive footage from other countries and presented them as local )"

Most people make their opinions clear in a tweet or a few sentences. Joe feels the need to pontificate for 20 minutes at a time until his original point makes no sense. And he's talking to a fucking nobody who has no connection to OnA. Keep that shit in the family, you rat-bastard."
SNSD,"The problem with interacting online is that you have to infer tone through purely text alone, which leads to many people misunderstanding others posts.   I would like to think we were just discussing things. I've never gotten angry about anything you have said, we just don't agree on certain things, which again, leads people to think if you don't agree on something then you must be fighting about it."
EliteDangerous,"Elite is a piloting simulator which has trading, fighting and exploration components. You are able to upgrade your ship with rewards from any of these activities.   A game is usually considered dull when there's no dynamic gameplay within a particular element or when switching elements is poorly paced. Right now, all seem to apply.   The original was fun because of the switching of playstyles -- all the components above existed just as in E:D and they dovetailed very well and were greatly paced. You switched seamlessly from one gameplay style to another in a timeframe of a few minutes, just as they were becoming boring. And even if you didn't have a final goal, you had very clear advancement steps.   Now this isn't happening. The individual components are more fun than the original but the game's pace is out of whack. From a conceptual perspective what you're noticing is that there's a lot missing with regards to dynamic gameplay. Maybe it's because the game is still barebones or maybe it's because the design is lacking, I really can't tell. But there is a problem."
EliteDangerous,"Provided the current pricing model isn't modified.  I would think that since the "goal" beta was to test things and not give a realistic progression, that things have been progressed.  For example, I went from the first ship to a Lakon 6 in less than 2 days and I've only had the game for a week or so.  Admittedly I found out about the Coelrind mining spot fairly early which accelerated my income a great deal."
EliteDangerous,"More for hand in distance just means you fly to the right distance just like people do with rares now. It doesn't make exploring scale or earn more for casual explorers starting out in the field.   But, as I said, I'm not even sure that's a real problem. It's frustrating if you want to earn big money exploring, but I'm not sold it's actually something that needs fixing.   Not everything needs to be equal in making Credits per hour. If you want many $$ you have the option to go trade like everyone else. Or you can do something different and accept that you're not going to earn the same amount. The focus on $/hr is understandable and at the same time entirely pointless.   I know bounty hunting, while less $/hr than trading, gets you more rep with the major factions than trading.   I know doing missions, while less $/hr than trading, gets you more rank progession points than trading.   There is a balance there based on the different "currencies" already in the game. We may just not understand what the special benefit of exploring is yet."
EliteDangerous,"From what I've played it's remarkably stable. A good chunk of posts on this sub are just people bitching about the few minor bugs, and on the whole CMDRs are cool in game, unless they're griefers. In response to the bugs you mentioned:     the ships randomly exploding was a collision bug that was patched a few hours after our first big update was released     unclaimable bounties was patched in similar speed     again, some CMDRs are jerks and log out, but most keep with the realism and take the consequences of losing a dogfight. Sure, Frontier could place penalties for leaving combat, but I feel that it'd be cheap and difficult to determine when the player was either (a.) ditching due to losing, or (b.) being disconnected from the server due to internet issues/has to urgently leave the computer.       However, on the game design side, there is still a lot lacking. In other words: it plays fine (bugs get patched reasonably quickly/is extremely well optimized) but the things you do ingame get dull pretty quickly. Here's two posts that describe this scenario pretty well - [Article 1]( [Article 2]( - but what they basically say is that there is little gratification in playing for a long period of time. You start poor and have to grind either trading/bounty hunting/mining to make enough credits to outfit a bigger ship. And what do you do with the bigger ship? Grind some more, to get an even bigger ship. And the big ships are outrageously priced, and there are few ships between the 300,000 credit price and the 1,600,000 credit price.   As well, the only activity that you can do better with bigger ships is trading, as they have larger jump-ranges and bigger cargo holds. For mining and combat, the best ships are between 140,000 and 300,000 credits. Any bigger and it's too expensive to maintain, and too sluggish to do well against these two, much cheaper ships.   The"
EliteDangerous,"I consider this an AI problem, not an issue with people not paying attention to what they're shooting. Also he probably runs beams which deal too much damage too quickly for the recent fix to work.   Recently they made it so that small hits to shields wouldn't cause a bounty to be placed on your head, but I get one every time with my beam lasers.   Also, back to the AI bit, if a ship crosses your screen in the span of less than a second your reaction time has to be spot on to not shoot them, and not all of us have the reaction time of a late teen/early 20 something anymore. Even at around .4 seconds to react I've already shot them and have a measly 200/300 credit bounty on my head that I must go pay off immediately or be hunted."
EliteDangerous,"I personally think, and I'm sure many would agree, that the Python is the superior ship in almost every way. The FDL does have the stronger shields, even with a lower class shield 5A it is better than the Pythons 6A and cost less. But that is really the only thing the FDL is objectively better then the Python, anything else you could say the FDL is better is really subjective. Some may say the FDL huge hardpoint is better but I would rather have 3 large and 2 medium on the Python than 1 huge and 4 medium on FDL, and as you said hardpoint placement on the FDL is much worse then the Python. The Python hardpoint placement is arguably perfect.   Armor doesn't really matter in PVP because any decent CMDR is going to target the powerplant and effectively bypass armor. In PVE the Python does have better armor. Other than that the Python has 2 less utility slots but unquestionably better internal compartments. FDL internal compartments are quite shit tbh for a ship of that price range, even the Clipper is better at less than half the price. FDL compartments are barely better then the Vulture. It's no wonder they cut the FDL price in half, there is no way that thing is a 100 million credit ship.   Anyway it boils down to what you like, what you want to do with the ship and how much you want to spend. Expect to spend more to really upgrade a Python but you will have a much better ship in the end. The FDL really has a shit jump range (Python isn't a lot better but it is better, another 4-5ly depending on modules), shit fuel tank size, and shit cargo ability. These last few points are really disgraceful on the FDL, I can't imagine why they thought a 8t fuel tank was acceptable, never mind the jump range and complete lack of cargo. In case you didn't already know check out www.edshipyard.com where you can play around with builds and see what the ship of your dreams will cost and compare builds of each ship to see if it's what you want."
OpenPV,"Pulled out an old trick and fixed the resistance issue.  The fixed resistor I grabbed was actually a 200ohm resistor (face palm) so instead of waiting on a new one or scrounging one, I filed the resistor til it was at 218.5 ohms as per spec for the OKR.  Pretty simple to do with a needle file.  Just hook up your meter set to proper resistance range and file through the outer coating til you hit the resistance material (carbon film resistors only) and remove material til you hit your desired resistance.  With this method you can only increase resistance so you have to start with lower value than your target."
gametales,"The four of us had been searching for a Dwarven lumberjack who we presumed had been kidnapped as the nearby forest was the home to an army of Orcs, Kobolds and undead. We went to the Dwarfs favourite haunt - the local tavern - to try and find out where he had recently been working.   For reference our party leader (played by me) was a Half-Elf fighter who rolled a natural 3 for CHA. I was also backed up by a sarcastic Gnome, a sadistic loner type Elf and a Lizardman who only spoke draconic so whilst we  MEANT  well we weren't exactly the most diplomatic group to say the least.   After approaching the patrons and coming up with nothing we turned to the bartender. Now as we approached we noticed a HUGE battleaxe hanging behind the completely normal sized human serving the booze. He tells us that why yes he  DOES  know where the Dwarf was working but the information is going to cost us. Now, the thing about my character is until this day he had never, and I mean never been bested in a fight, no matter the foe. I had gone one on one with trolls, orc warlords and evil wizards and there was no way I was going to let this completely average little man disrespect me in this way,  especially  when I'm trying to do something nice.   So at first, being an asshole, but a moral asshole I remind the bartender that the dwarf is his friend. Also that I have no problem punching through the back of his head and letting the giant walking lizard snack on whatever's left. And the bartender points to the giant axe on the wall and says "I'm afraid she might have something to say about it though". Recognising that this guy is going to need some persuading, I start what is yet another (seemingly) easily won fight. As soon as I land my mighty punch however the bartender grows into a 12 foot tall slab of muscles and punches me backwards through the door, before easily dealing with the rest of the party and making us look like a bunch of chumps single handedly.   It was on this day that I learned three lessons - I discovered the race known as Firbolgs and gained my first true nemesis in a shape-shifting asshole of a bartender. But thirdly (and most importantly) I learned to start fights with people much smaller and weaker than you, because that way you'll always win.   I still remember how shocked I felt that my invincible Half-Elf could have been bested, even if it was by a giant."
gametales,"Our usual party had two guests from out of town join us for game night last week, so they made up characters that would go their own ways at the end of the night.   Our group, a warlock, druid, monk and fighter (myself) come to this town after a few weeks in the wilderness. One of the guests is running for mayor of this town this election year and the other is a contact to lead us further on our quest.   As always the group splits up once we get to town and explore. The druid, a Elf Druid who has very bad communication skills goes to the tavern for a drink and a meal. The CE Warlock decides to just hang about the town square and scope the place out, waiting for his moment to cause mayhem. The monk heads to a museum to see if a map we came across has any special meaning. And I, after visiting the blacksmith to repair my shield, head to the tavern to drink the night away.   A little backstory, our nemeses are a group of Dragonborn hell bent on resurrecting Bahamut and reigning in a new era of Dragon rule in the realm. So naturally our group has a bit of prejudice against Dragonborn.   Well, one of the guests decides he is going to be a Dragonborn and things go awry.   He was expecting us, as his employer told him to look for a band of adventurers and lead them to a secret path up the mountain. So he sees the Druid go to the tavern and follows her in. The Warlock, seeing his chance, follows closely behind. The Druid orders and finds a table near the hearth of the tavern and begins to eat as she sees a Dragonborn wander in to the bar. They lock eyes and he begins to approach her. As he is about six feet from her, the Warlock enters and yells, "LOOK OUT, HE'S AFTER US!"   The Druid leaps onto the table and attacks the Dragonborn. I hear the ruckus and charge into battle. Upon seeing the situation unfold, the bartender reaches up for his axe and is about to join the fray. I charge, slide over the bar and dropkick the barkeep and land on my ass.   Two of the town guards are in on their lunch break and try to break up the fight. The Warlock, having none of that business, decides to cast a spell and has black tentacles drag every living being around him to another dimension.   After the Warlock massacres almost everything in the tavern, I stand up and start grabbing bottles from the shelf and taking drinks. It was just about then, the barkeep comes to and swings at me with his axe. My armor taking the brunt of the blow, I swing, aiming for a wounding blow, not to kill. But I miss and spill his entrails on the floor.   The Dragonborn Bard tries to calm us all down and tries to charm the Warlock. He succeded but gave the Warlock an alibi to what he had done to the bar patrons. While the Dragonborn is distracted, the Druid tries to ignite his cloak on fire, misses and the thatched roof goes up in a blaze.   Seeing what is happening, the other guest (the Dragonborns brother IRL) rushes to the now immolated bar with the rest of the guardsmen. The rest of the town is out, throwing buckets of water on the tavern, but to no effect.   I grab one more bottle of brandy and rush out the door, telling my party members to follow. As I emerge from the flame and smoke, I see about a dozen heavily armed and angry guards. Immediately I exclaim, "THE DRAGONBORN HAS GONE MAD!!!"   The Warlock was not able to exit the front door, and had to blast a hole in the back wall to make his exit. The last remaining people in the bar (alive at least) all set aside their differences, and make their escape into the woods.   And that is how we exiled every Dragonborn from that village, tried to think of a more evil alignment for the Warlock, got the LG Fighter (me) sent to prison and was assigned a CN alignment, broke me and a few other dangerous criminals out of prison on accident and all in all, got nothing accomplished that session except change the course of history for that small village."
gametales,"Our party consisted of a moron alchemist, a warrior whose wife was killed by orcs, the warrior's pet wolf, an living gargoyle, a little boy necromancer, and a vampire rogue.   We're looking for an orc bandit leader for a bounty.  The alchemist walks up to the first orc he sees and asks if he knows him.  The orc is immediately offended, "That's racist.  Do you think all orcs know each other?"  The alchemist responds, "Yes, orcs are bandits, you're an orc, you must know the bandit leader."  This conversation and escalates for a while as the alchemist digs his hole deeper.   Meanwhile, the newly turned vampire is having a hard time accepting that alcohol doesn't work on him now that he's undead, so he's determined to consume enough liquor to prove biology wrong.  The gargoyle, who has never had a drop of alcohol in his life, decides to join him.   Things with the alchemist escalate until he eventually just throws a fireball potion at the orc.  The orcs raise their axes to attack.  The warrior, who is excited for a fight with orcs rushes in ready to fight as well.  The vampire, being the only member of the party without a boner for murder uses his whip to swing over between the fighting parties like Indiana fucking Jones thanks to a Natural 20.  He then uses an ice spell to try to freeze the parties to stop the fight before it begins.  Unfortunately, he rolls a Natural 1 and freezes himself.  The warrior pushes him out of the way and begins fighting the orcs.   The gargoyle tries to follow the vampire, but as he is blackout drunk, crashes over the table and falls over.  Meanwhile the little boy necromancer is hiding under another table.   This escalates into a full on brawl and the vampire is trampled only a few HP points away from unconsciousness before he unfreezes.  The wolf picks up the little boy necromancer and runs to safety.  The gargoyle makes his way to the center of the fight and tries to help his friends.  Unfortunately, he has no idea what's going on and murders several bystanders all while thinking he's being helpful.   The vampire has accepted that the fight is going to happen anyway so tries to stay out of it.  But every time someone is killed, he grabs the body and walks them out of the bar like it's Weekend at Bernie's screaming "WE NEED TO GET THIS MAN TO A DOCTOR!"  Once outside he feeds on them to regain HP.  He does this several times, which the DM noted was highly unnecessary as nobody was paying attention to him anyway. He could have just fed on them in the middle of the bar and no one would have noticed.   Eventually things start going poorly for the party and the alchemist finally realizes a mistake, so he drops a slippery potion and the three remaining party members penguin slide on their bellies out the front door.   They find the vampire and little boy in the alley. The vampire admonishes the alchemist for being a racist prick, while he feeds on the body of the orc who the fight was started with.  While going through his pockets, as rogues tend to do, he finds identification saying that this man was the bandit leader and the alchemist's racist instincts were right all along.   MISSION ACCOMPLISHED."
gametales,"First session of the campaign, my DM had made characters for everyone and randomly handed them out. This was 3.5, and I had a Human Fighter who wielded a Fullblade. The bar fight starts up for some stoopid reason, and I decide to not go all out murderhobo on their asses, but I still want the fight to stop. So, I pull out my fullblade, turn it over to the flat of the blade, and step up to a strong looking barfighter, and bring it full-on down on his head from above.   Natural 20. Fuck, I didn't want to hurt the guy, but oh well, he'll figure out that this was a bad idea. I grab the dice, start rolling damage.   Max damage. On a crit. With my high Strength score (18 or 20, can't remember which), this comes out to around 30 points of damage. Even nonlethal, that was an instant kill. On a level 1 commoner. In the first round of combat. The first  action  of combat.   People fled into the streets and I got arrested for crushing a man with a flat piece of metal."

Your MCITP will have more value, even if you didn't touch a server (in a business environment) in your life.   Almost every IT guys that I met that didn't come off the college or university, had some basic experience like "BestBuy Computers Sales" or such.   Don't get me wrong tho, those guys are some of the best and WAY more competent IT workers that I have met. Most of the time, ITs are their passion and this WILL make a huge difference in your career.

I learnt a lot about Windows Servers, VPN's, Networking, Exchange etc etc. As I was also doing a lot of service calls/on site work I learned good communication skills, which will put you leaps and bounds ahead of people in the industry.   I then moved to a bigger company, around 40 staff as the SysAdmin there. They threw me in the deep-end on pretty much everything, and I had to learn under pressure and on the fly doing crazy big jobs for bigger companies. I got a few MS certificates doing this (SharePoint, Team Foundation Server - what ever I implemented there I did a certificate).

sysadmin,"I am curious if those of you who had the misfortune of suffering a UPS fire or explosion might help me out. I am curious what signs might have allowed you to predict the failure before it happened? Did you see the battery temperature rise? A particular change in the battery voltage? Something else? If anyone has any insight or suggestions on how to detect imminent catastrophic failure of a UPS, please share it. In case it matters, I am particularly interested in APC SMT and SRT line UPSes, but I suspect the symptoms and signs are chemically based, rather than vendor specific. :)   Batteries are pretty simple devices. If you smell something bad, start checking.   Minor Failures:     Pay attention to the service life. Once the battery is past the EOL date, have a replacement ready. Batteries are an expendable, self depleting resource. Plan out in advance replacement of batteries, even if they still read nominal. That is if corporate allows you to.   Smells that are abnormal   Temperature (hot or abnormal readings, even ones reading too cool)   Any and all warning notices should be escalated, purely to cover your ass.     Best case you get a self protect warning. Then there's the smells of eventual failure (metallic, rotten egg, hot plastic). Next is uncontrolled failure when the unit fails to enter self protection and the battery heats up to rupture or fire. Last is service failure due to lightning or something else equally as bad.   There will be no warning at all in a major failure IMHO. Basically the wheels have come off.   If there is an imbalance short, then how bad the situation gets depends on the rating of the UPS. Safety is by law and how much corporate values you. Don't expect more than the legal minimum.   I would focus more on preparing for a major failure as a safety measure. When you get on  a plane, they tell you how to escape from it as it sinks in the ocean. This is an extremely unlikely event, yet they still prepare every long flight for this event.   You need to do the same for a ups fire or explosion.     Have several of the large size CO2 extinguishers on hand. Make sure everyone knows how to use it.   Have a last resort chemical extinguisher, rated for industrial electronics. It must be non-conductive.They do sell home extinguishers good for 120V that would be unsafe for 25KV.  This will destroy all equipment it touches.   Decide if you want to evacuate or fight the fire before it happens. Stick to that plan. Do not decide while it is happening. I would suggest not fighting it, unless it's in the job contract. No one expects you to stop an armed robber, so why are you now suddenly a fireman?   Make sure there IS an evacuation plan for everyone on the floor, and organize drills.    Have information about the size and type of the UPS (If it's a large one) by the planned exit door, make sure it's laminated. Grab it as you leave and call 911 and tell them the specifications so the fire department knows what they are up against. This is purely my personal suggestion; I am not going to let someone run in blind to somewhere I just fled."

To go above that invites problems as no good deed goes unpunished.   Configure the tolerances for the alerts and schedule ample self tests.

If it's 5%, then I would set alerts to 15% +/- of stated voltage and temperature, compare temperature to the ambient room temperature. If it triggers, request a replacement. When they deny it, keep logs until it fails.   When it comes up for discussion, resist saying "I told you so". In fact, say nothing unless they ask about the tickets. "A request for replacement or service was put in six months ago and declined". If they ask you who declined, tell them you will forward the ticket to them. Never verbally say the responsible parties name if you can avoid it. Let management pass the buck around until they agree to bury it. If you verbally call someone out, they most likely won't get fired but now you'll have an adversary."
circlebroke,"My favourite reply](   >I tried this as well. Ended up making a fool of myself though. Argument wasn about Christianity but about the drafters of the constitution believing in a personal god. I argued that the bulk were deists. Turns out that of 55 people, 49 were Protestants, 3 were deists and 3 were anti church but still believers. Even r/atheism is capable of selective quotation to support its cause (gasp!)   Gosh darn it, that argument grates me so. The 'not a Christian nation' one does, too, but not as much. I don't think the Founding Fathers imagined the U.S. not being Christian. If it's true, how much does that matter? Governments evolve, and we've reestablished our nation as the land of the free, including free religion. Yes, we have to keep fighting for our freedom, but as a history nerd who likes honesty, I think revising our history to help these fights leads us down a bad path. People latching on to "The Founding Fathers were deist!" are creating disinformation to support secularism, rather than forming better arguments with true supporting evidence."
circlebroke,"This is two extremes that I don't think anyone can agree with.   DRM used to be very simple (and for many companies still is).  A unique game code.  Allow only one game code to come online at a time and you shut down piracy like what this company experienced.   The current problem with gaming is multi-faceted, but excessive DRM kills games.   As someone who pirates games (and buys them later if I like them) I find there is a sickening lack of ways to preview a game.  Many "demos" are too short or limited to get an experience of the game or aren't actual game play. A game I might have never bought on my own is Tropico 4.  I like city builders but it didn't sound very good but I thought I would try it.  Loved it.  Bought it.  Bought all the DLC.   On the flip side there are a number of games where I thought the premise sounded great but ended up being just awful like Sins of a Solar Empire, for example.  I would have been very upset if I paid $50 for the game.  It's just awful.   A lot of my grief comes from being younger and buying games at premium prices only to get home and be incredibly disappointed by the quality and/or game play.   If the industry wanted to reduce piracy (not eliminate because it will never happen), there are a few simple things to actually combat the problem:     Remove intrusive DRM - Always Online DRM, Account Login, Internet required activation, CD required etc and go back to a simple system.     Reduce the cost if you aren't buying on physical media, reduce the cost of the game     Make the price of the game based off time played, not a set media price.  Why am I paying $60 for a game that has 50 hours of game time versus the same cost for a game with 10 hours of game time?     Standardize the cost and release dates of game across borders.  There is no reason Australia should pay double the cost for a game AND have to wait 2 months extra to get it.     Value loyalty among customers.  If I am buying Assassins Creed 52, and I have purchased the previous versions, throw me a bone.  This doesn't even have to be a monetary incentive - give me a bonus level, weapon or something.     Revert DLC to expansions.  Instead of $3 here and $2 there, release a big pack for $10 as an expansion.  This is what stayed my hand from buying Tropico 4 at first.  $30 for the game and another $30 for DLC was too much for the game.     Make DRM like Batman Arkham Asylum.  For those that don't know, anyone trying to circumvent the DLC was stopped just a few levels in by an intentionally placed "bug".     Lastly, allow Steam and other resellers to set prices on their own.  Stop trying to horde profits.  Steam has led the way for sales and packages to make tons of money for companies.  I would even argue that Steam saved a dying gaming industry with its Steam Sales.       I won't argue that Piracy isn't stealing.  It is.  However, without any other option, we are left in this predicament.  I would have saved thousands of dollars in purchases the last few years without Piracy because I absolutely can't stand to purchase a game and hate it.  I can't return it after opening it, there wasn't any way to play it before hand because games for PC aren't rented at blockbuster like XBox games are...I'm stuck.  Piracy returned that ability to me.  It also allows me to purchase when I feel the price is right for the game.  I liked Dragon Age, and bought it when it hit $30 which I believed was a fair price instead of the $100 (with all the DLC)."
circlebroke,"the defaults are out of control.   Agree and disagree. Some defaults are completely out of control, some are relatively well done. /r/askreddit, while it is the source of a lot of stupid shit, has a pretty active and large team, as does /r/pics, as will /r/atheism in the future... I hope.   Part of the problem is lack of what many default mods view as qualified individuals for the job. If you run a 10k user sub you can recruit from the userbase, no biggy. Hell, that's how we got a lot of the mods here. Even at that size, you're still running into the same names a lot and can easily judge their character. Used to be I couldn't go a post without seeing /u/twentone_21's dumb ass for example.   100k user sub? Gets iffy. I've added mods in /r/ImGoingToHellForThis via recommendation from other mods there even if they don't have a lot of experience of their own. You can have a new dude or two and have them learn from you and make mistakes without any issue because the sub isn't so active that shit is going to boil over immediately if someone fucks up.   Million+ user sub? Now you  need  some street cred. It's the proverbial big time, and bringing on fresh meat that is totally untrained is going to slow everyone else down, and get regular users kind of pissed off as well, because why should they trust the judgment of this asshole? On top of that, it's harder for that asshole to justify themselves under that sort of scrutiny. Shit boils over fast so if someone is a bit clueless, that can quite easily cause ye olde shitstorm.   You definitely can't have slackers... even though the top end of most of the defaults is pretty fucking incestuous and in those kind of cases the mod is going to be paying  way  less attention then other non-incestuous mods.   Now this incest especially plays into /r/worldnews. Every mod there  without exception  mods another default sub. Speaking from the experience of modding a 100k+ sub (Two actually, though AutoMod does all the work in /r/circlejerk) as one of the most active (as in I had like 4,000 mod actions while the next highest had 2,000 in a three month period) mods that is a lot of fucking work.   Now imagine 10 times that activity. Even spread out between multiple mods, with the fact that they  have modding of other subs of the same size as well tends to means that there simply aren't enough bodies to handle shit like the spamfilter, let alone actually go into comments and handle business.   All of that said: It's not going to get better because as far as I've seen, they're [losing mods faster then they gain them]( and I haven't seen anyone recruiting there at all.   I'm of two minds about that whole thing: As a mod of /r/circlebroke that is fucking great! We'll have boatloads of content simply because without mods handling business /r/worldnews will (>Implying it hasn't already) degenerate into a huge piece of shit. As a reddit user though, that's pretty fucking weak shit that I wish we could have something done about. As my two options in that regard are unsubbing and applying to be a mod, I've opted for the former.   I can't state all the reasons I don't want to mod /r/worldnews specifically because it involves privileged information (Privileged as in: No, I won't tell you, don't even bother to PM me about it.), but I don't want to mod defaults in general because:     That's too much fucking work. I come to reddit to look at dumb cat pictures and complain, not deal with several page long spam filters, /r/subredditdrama and huge pieces of shit I can't just ban because fuck them I'm done with their shit.   Fuck reddit witch hunts.   I don't feel like the admins would have my back in the event of 2. I'm sure /u/karmanaut or /u/davidreiss666 would be happy to elaborate on how much the admins have helped them in their individual witch hunts     Well I went a bit rambly there, but..."
circlebroke,"Honestly this was more of an anti-china jerk than a pro-japan one or at least an anti-China jerk masqueraded as a pro-Japan jerk.   Reddit has a history of being fairly anti-japan unless they are talking about Japanese girls or anime (in specific subs only), but they also have a much more prevalent anti-China jerk.   I think what we are seeing here is a mixture of two jerks, "Japan is respectful and neat" jerk, which honestly isn't as common as the "Japan is backwards, racist, and fucked up" jerk, and the "China is horrible and so are the people" jerks."
virtualreality,"I think the primary difference in perspectives here is that there are two questions, would living permanently in VR be good for the individual and would it be good for humanity as a whole. Most people are answering either yes for the former or no for the latter but not addressing both.   Do you think that if humanity had been able to create fully immersive VR a thousand years ago our real-world knowledge would have advanced as far as it has?   I think theres a really heavy philosophical question embedded in this about the place in our lives for work and for contentment and entertainment. Is a life where you don't have to do any work you don't enjoy worth less? Popular opinion would agree that those people who have all of their needs and wants met at will (heirs/heiresses etc) are socially underdeveloped and have personality problems. I've not seen any experimental evidence on this though.   There are a lot of other issues that could be addressed. Would VR be equally available to all? Will it end up on the UDHR some day like access to internet/information is now.   I really liked the way Grant/Naylor looked at this in Red Dwarf and the novelisations. Basically BTL or better than life is a full VR sim that creates a reality based on fulfilling your subconscious desires and then erases your memory of entering the simulation. Lister ends up in a recreation of it's a wonderful life with a loving wife and children and everyone treats each other extremely well. Rimmer subconsciously hates himself so he ends up rich, famous, successful and married to the most beautiful woman in the world but still depressed and hating himself. Their physical bodies deteriorate even though their need for food etc is automated.   Something else worth considering is the content of the simulation. Is it necessarily more fulfilling than your existing life and why? It depends on your values and what your goals are. How would personal relationships differ in VR. Would having your wants met virtually be fulfilling. Will VR environments ever necessarily be 'better' or more enjoyable than real world ones. If there are no obstacles to creating anything that can be imagined will the fantastic simply become mundane to those who see it every day?   On the other hand digital worlds have a potential to be the final great equaliser. If a 50 room mansion is virtual, copying it costs only a fraction of the resources of its creation. Why can't every human have their own world or galaxy if the hardware can get us there? Virtual property eliminates the problem of scarcity for practical purposes."
cscareerquestions,"Recruiter here.  All of those characteristics are implied as needed for the position.  It goes without saying that in today's competitive market being a positive, quick-learning team player is a necessity.  Having these traits intrinsically will lead to success in the interview process, however on a resume, this is just fluff.   The resume's purpose is to illustrate skills and/or relevant experience directly correlated to the job scope and requirements."
cscareerquestions,"That is an excellent, and difficult question.  It's not unlike "which is better, a small private college or a huge state university?"  Both have their pros and cons.  In an ideal career, you will spend some time at a few of each, and be able to develop your own preference.   The biggest risk, in my opinion, is that you avoid learning  the wrong lessons  from each sized company.  Bigger companies teach cynicism.  You end up working alongside 20- and 40-year industry veterans who are tired, tired,  tired  of the bullshit, and they unload their bitterness and hopeless soul-sucking vitriol on the fresh new enthusiastic greenhorn because they hate the fact that you still start the day with a smile.  They can turn you into one of them.  It's a genuine risk, like reading too much Dilbert and believing it represents the whole picture instead of one small, glum corner.   On the other hand, they tend to have fantastic benefit structures (like HR departments that can actually do their job), decent training opportunities, smooth travel reimbursements, pleasant facilities, and -- most important of all -- a well-trained and professional management cadre.  Big companies only stay big by knowing how to train and promote managers who actually have some concept of how to do their job (management).  It's  nice  to have a good manager, who's actually been to several years of management training and has 10+ years in managing employees.  Big companies monitor their manager effectiveness closely, and don't tolerate too much crap (there are plenty of mid-level applicants waiting to fill their shoes, so they can demote poor performers back into the ranks with no risk at all).   Finally, a major risk at any large company is that  you may never leave .  This happens  a lot : people get comfortable.  They get increasingly skilled in an increasingly tiny niche field and 3 years turns into 7 turns into 15 and suddenly you start to think the world's passing you by, you've walled yourself into a crevice with no out, but now you're  afraid  to leave because you've haven't updated your resume in 15 years and you haven't sat the other side of an interview desk in ages and you're literally terrified to leave your job because you've forgotten how to look for another one.  I've seen this happen to bright, skilled, talented engineers over and over and over.  Beware the comfortable roost.   On the other hand ...small companies have their issues too.  Their HR departments often suck, which can actually affect you when you're trying to get a W-2 reprint or hardcopy paystubs for employment verification or detailed questions about your health plan or whatever.  Worse, in my opinion, is that they often have wide fluctuation in the quality and caliber of their managers.  Many were promoted up from technical or other "individual contributor" roles, and have absolutely no idea how to manage effectively.  Small companies provide little support for fledgling managers to learn their trade, so they tend to be...well, just very bad at their jobs, in a huge variety of ways: under-communicative or over-communicative, never-there or always-there, brutally abusive or uselessly soft, whatever.   From this experience you can learn a variety of bad things: you can be brow-beaten into thinking you're a worthless sack of shit (saw it happen to a guy last week), you can fail to grow and expand for lack of the encouragement and nurture and training opportunities you genuinely deserve, and worse you can come to believe this is NORMAL, dooming yourself to a lifetime of repeat experiences because you apply your now-twisted dysfunctional expectations to every future manager, who by-God will achieve them...and  worst  of all, you may actually  absorb  the behaviours you witness, and go on to torture others by repeating the same sick mechanisms.   Of course, small companies have real plusses too.  Theoretically, they are able to double their sales, then  double  them again, and again and again...a trick no large company can possibly pull off.  You can go from being employee #15 of a 15-man operation to #15 of a 15,000-man behemoth (I've seen it happen, though unfortunately not to me).  Because  everyone  wears lots of hats, you learn lots of hats: everyone does some tech, some admin, some sales, some customer support...sometimes you run out and bring lunch, sometimes you vacuum up at the end of the day, sometimes you place orders for 50 new servers, sometimes you explain to the venture capitalists why their million-dollar advertising campaign fell through (that one, sadly, was me).  It's an exciting rush.  You may go weeks without sufficient sleep.  You'll almost certainly never see a dime of the stock options you're promised, so negotiate most of your salary in cash.   Between the two, I would have to recommend starting with the smaller company, for one simple reason: it won't last.  Small companies fail, or get sold, or move to San Diego, or (frequently) get bought by larger companies, and you end up working for a big company in spite of yourself.  The point is, almost no small company  stays  small -- they're non-sustainable.  They either grow or are subsumed or they die.  And that's why if you start with a small, you'll eventually get a chance to try big as well (perhaps on the rebound), whereas if you start big, you may never see the light of small.   ;"
cscareerquestions,"Freelance sites are shit - No one in the first world is able to compete with the prices quoted by developers in developing countries, because their cost of living is so low.   I relied almost exclusively on word of mouth and friends. Obviously, this depends on what your skillset is (Computer Science breaks down into many different worlds).  In my case, it was primarily web development, which has a low-ish barrier to entry.   A friend needed a website?  I built it, and ran it on my server.   That friend then recommended me to another friend who was starting a business.  I built that site, and also ran it on my server, charging a monthly maintenance fee to build some passive income just for keeping her CMS up to date and automating a few backups and other scripts I never had to look at.   Then a different friend wanted to try building an SMS marketing system, and targetting SMB as clients.  I built the entire thing from scratch, including a CMS for the clients, and a SOAP-based SMS delivery system.  It was a great learning opportunity, and has since become one of my best portfolio trophies for job interviews.   After that, an old acquaintance of mine from University got back in touch, saying he needed help because his last developer bailed.  This was my first client-from-hell, and another awesome learning opportunity.   After that, I'd gotten enough experience that my resume started to flesh out, and I had some talking points in the interview.  I also started looking at RFP's to look for larger contracts.   Basically, word of mouth, and good networking behaviours will win you clients. Just toss your skills on Facebook, Linked In, etc saying you're open for projects, and hear some people out on offers.  Never burn bridges, and be professional, no matter how long you've known the person.  It'll start slow, but once the ball starts rolling, you'll never be out of work as long as you stay professional."
cscareerquestions,"There's still a lot of prejudice  against  post-grad degrees in the industry, and listing a PHD on your resume may actively harm your chances at landing a job. The one exception to this rule is if your PHD is extremely focused and you're looking for a job that perfectly matches your focus.   The reasons why this is the case are many:     Some companies were started out of garages and basements by college dropouts and they tend to believe that "pick yourself up by your bootstraps" results in a better developer than schooling   Some companies are run/managed by people with Bachelors-only degrees and tend to assume that one loses all practical abilities once they start their Masters degrees. I actually fall into this camp (and recognize it's a stereotype, just being completely honest).   Many HR departments will view the PHD and assume that you wouldn't be satisfied with the pay levels that are set to attract people with Bachelors or were self-taught.   Even if you declare you're fine with it, there's the assumption that your job dissatisfaction will be very high after a few months and you will view the work as beneath you."
cscareerquestions,"Pure Math is a slightly different ball game.   When I'm hiring a software engineer I need practicality mixed with the ability to anticipate problems and inefficiencies. CompSci degrees give one a broad introduction to computing which is a resource you can pull on to more easily understand software techniques and tools and creatively come up with your own. That utility is fully taken advantage of at the BS level where as MS level work gets deep into the theory of computation that is not always applicable to the fact that I need this system functioning by tomorrow in a way that is maintainable a year from now.   If I were to hire a stats guy I would want someone who can take reams of data and give me distilled bite sizes chunks of information I can use effectively. I don't know much about that side of the world but AFAIK pure Math PHDs tend to get snapped up as quants pretty quickly.   Math is also and older, more defined discipline."
cscareerquestions,"Most certifications are for IT folk - the people that take care of the servers, the routers, the operating systems, etc.  Almost none of them are actually relevant to Software Development, and I have not seen anyone use them to their advantage when applying to Software Development jobs."
cscareerquestions,"I work for a fortune 100 company that you would probably accept a job from if offered: It doesn't matter, the HR system is going to mangle it completely and all we're going to see is some ungodly unicode nightmare           Edit to add (because I hate when people make jokes in serious subreddits): Unless your position is creative, no one is going to care what your resume looks like beyond how much information it gets across quickly. If you  are  creative, IMO, still keep it professional, but present as much information as you can quickly visually like in the template you linked to. The thing to remember is: On resumes, lists of skills are bullshit. If you haven't done something important enough with that skill to warrant mentioning it in context on your resume, you're probably not that good at it, or you're probably not choosing what to list on your resume well.   To be clear, if presenting a list of skills  is  a demonstration of your ability to use those skills, by all means: go for it. But I'm going to be more impressed by the resume that says "Converted department's legacy perl scripts to portable python modules, adding flexibility to our workflow and allowing the use of more modern tools" than the resume that says  Python: *****; Perl ***; Building tools *****  (imagine that was pretty).   But yeah,"
changemyview,"Some people like simple. When looking at different computers out today there is much variety in the windows department. Laptops not only range from $500-$1700 but so much of it is absolute crap. I was reading earlier about an HP computer where the motherboard had melted through. While this is a rare occasion windows computers require research to some extent. Mac is simple, while there is 5 options all 5 are fine computers. Also consider macs are pretty, they don't use any plastic and have a very nice polished look to them. Finally macs users have brand loyalty, my dad bought an apple TV for himself and that thing works so well, connect to WiFi and it instantly allows you to steam videos."
changemyview,"There's a lot of identity wrapped up in being a "Mac Person" or a "PC Person" or a "Linux Person."   This isn't a mistake. Computers are now marketed the same way cars are. You buy a Camero because you're "badass and I know it." You buy a Lexus because "fuck off Proletarian swine!"   Its the same marketing.   I use my Mac computers for work. I'm an audio engineer and I record musicians, do system optimization (make the PA sound good), and use the laptop for soft-synths. Mac's aren't perfect by any means, but they're stable. That's all I really care about when I have clients breathing down my neck. It does the job I need it to.   Its just a tool. Its not who I am. Its the right tool for the right job  for me .

changemyview,"I think legalizing gay marriage would be fixing a symptom, rather than curing a disease, so to speak. In other words, gay marriage is not the problem, gay marriage is caused by a bigger problem. That bigger problem if the US government violating its own principle of "separation of church and state" by giving special perks and benefits to those who have participated in a particular religious ordinance.   Gay marriage should not be legalized because it would just be spreading that problem. We need to take religion COMPLETELY out of state, not just where its inconvenient.   Gay marriage should not be illegal, either. The government should not have any say at all. It does not have that right. It would be like banning Bar Mitzvah's or the Hajj. It should not get a vote on the matter. Leave that up to individual churches if they want to allow it or not.   However, that would leave a huge gap in our society. How do we decide who gets to say if a hospital pulls the plug on you? How do we decide who gets your crap if you die? How do we decide how much less you should pay in taxes because you're supporting another adult at home?   It wouldn't be hard to, for example, allow each adult to designate one other adult, who must choose them in return, to make these decisions, share these benefits, etc, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, etc."
changemyview,"my personal understanding has always been that, provided 2 explanations have equal explanatory power, the simpler one is to be preferred.  I understand this to be true because in science, we always start out by defining and understanding small parts of the whole, then slowly peace it together as time goes on, possibly adjusting our model along the way (shout out to lakatos!)   In explaining lightning, "zeus" is a theory. So is electric discharge. The latter is simpler, hence i prefer it, test it, find it to have some truth in it. Thus i can adjust my theory, and say "lightning is, in some way, caused by electric discharge" and then keep investigating that way.   should i find lightning not to be connected to electric discharge, i can always return to the more complicated option, zeus, and investigate in that direction."
changemyview,"When you present someone with an idea their brain will process it i.e. any information you give is at least involuntarily reacted to. If you draw attention to something negative subjectively or pseudo-objectively in that persons mind the next event is an emotional response. If you know that and have chosen to say something you have also chosen to illicit that response even if there is some probability involved here and it's much closer to a shared responsibility biased towards you.   An analogous process is changing someones emotional state by injecting psychoactive drugs into a persons bloodstream. If you do that, you would be responsible for changing someone's emotional state, right? (Excepting the admonished responsibility due to an individual tolerance/sensitivity/resistance etc.) If you consider that neurological connections can be broken or reinforced by verbal information and stimuli, i.e. associations with emotional states can be made via language alone, then if you possess in advance sets of information corresponding to a particular emotional state and use it, I honestly don't see it being particularly different to injecting drugs into someones body.   Essentially, I just can't accept your model of responsibility as being binary, it's a very complicated network.   Equally, I would actually argue the exact opposite of you and say you are much less responsible for your own emotional state than your environment is. Someone who is exposed to great depths of poor treatment and verbal abuse throughout their life will carry a much heavier emotional weight because of it, yet the responsibility for that state would not be the individual's.   Subscribing this to determinism is pointless (although obviously is the case) as the discussion is shifted from personal responsibility to responsibility is arbitrary in a single word, it's a macroscopic view and doesn't really help you discuss individual instances of responsibility. Considering responsibility in single interactions where both parties are essentially glorified turing machines and supposing responsibility would be attributed on the basis of one GTM reaching an offensive state causing GTM2 to reach an upset state, for me it still satisfies the condition that you can be held responsible for causing someone elses emotional distress even if the previous states were reached by other interactions.   Saying that being responsible for your emotional state because it's yours is the same kind of responsibility as owning a mobile phone, you're responsible for keeping it safe but if someone takes it out of your hands and throws it into a lake I would say it is their responsiblity for destroying it."
changemyview,"Good models work very hard.  My best friend is a model and she has to book her own gigs, come up with a bunch of the ideas for the shoots, and then follow the directions of very picky photographers.  She has to have people poke and paint every intimate spot on her face/body sometimes (depending on the gig) and she can be standing in high heels and a bikini for 16 straight hours without food and maybe 1 bathroom break.  One gig nearly blinded her for making her stay under murky water for 5 hours (they brought scuba tanks to keep her down there as long as they could) with her eyes held WIDE open for prolonged periods of time.  She makes maybe 40K a year and is considered to be in the top echelon of models working in the biz.  Once in a while a model lands a gig that pays a bunch, but 99 percent of it is at the level of about 20 an hour when you average it out.   Furthermore, she has to have a strict work ethic, create contacts that want to work with her, move her body in specific ways (it's actually awesome to watch her work, she transforms her body into a modern art piece), understand artistic visions and how her look fits into them, know what angles her face and body look good at, deal with rejection and disrespect from every angle, have people assume she can be grabbed and groped because of her job and a billion other stresses you havent considered.  She adopts a specific way of moving and looking when she has to be in front of a camera.  There are lots of strong people, not all of them get paid to play football.  She has to have skills and genetic qualities combined.  And she has to not be a huge bitch so people want to work with her.  She's a professional through and through.   Her look has helped sell millions of dollars of products.  People look at certain photos of her (often that she designed the concept for and bought the clothes herself) and they are just struck by it.  The angle, the concept, etc.  There are a million pretty faces, but ever see a picture of a face and it just grabs you?  There is skill in that.   It's not just looks.  There is a professional network, punctuality, creativity, the ability to follow directions, the willingness to deal with weird and uncomfortable situations and outfits, a constant supply of unknown weirdness and, on several occasions, she has been screwed out of her days wage because her industry provides few legal protections for working models so people can actually 'steal' her time.  She is constantly turning down jobs where people would take advantage of her in one wya or another, and she is constantly asked to do porn, and runs the risk that walking into a new job might be dangerous to her health (she texts me addresses before she walks in because that's what smart girls do)  She has to deal with these risks because that's the way her job goes.  She loves it and works very hard to be good at it.   She easily puts in 60 hours every week.  No contest."
changemyview,"My parents were in Amway during most of my childhood.  I got dragged across the country to conventions and seminars all of the time.  It was cool, I got to hang out in expensive hotels and meet multi-millionaires.  They weren't all that high up the food chain, (I think they got to the Pearl level or whatever the fuck that is, but they got a oyster in a jar for it) but they made some ok money.  It may not have been that much if you counted out all the hours they put into it, but they still receive checks in the mail from it (now like 15ish years later).  My dad has said that he would never have been as successful as he is without Amway.  Not necessarily just because of the cash, (which did help bankroll his own business) but because it made him talk to people.  He had to go out and bring up this business opportunity to family, friends, and even strangers.  He broke through any anxiety of that kind of situation, which allowed him to be more brazen and go on and be successful at other things."
changemyview,"Let me give you a little personal history first. In 1993 I joined Amway for a few months and swore off MLM as a scam for idiots. Since then, I started a new unit at Blue Cross/Blue Shield, worked on the trading floor at Bank of America Headquarters, worked in the Back Office Server group at Microsoft, and started my own consulting company all before joining Ambit Energy, a MLM electricity and natural gas supply company.   What I learned from Ambit is that ONLY smart, capable, and driven people who know other smart, capable, and driven people will succeed in MLM.   The real problems I've had, which made me stop working at it, even after having some success and setting up a residual income, is all the people that claim to be driven, pay to sign up, never go as far to even open the welcome kit box, and get pissed off that checks didn't start magically showing up in the mail.   I really do believe that while most MLM are either complete bullshit, or too old to get in early enough, I know, from personal experience, that there is at least one exception.  Even with that, I've yet to find a single person willing to simply ask a few people "Are you interested in making some more money?"   Another really big problem is that most smart, capable, and driven people catch a whiff of MLM and forget all their manners.  People who have respected me for decades and made shittons of money off of me, my ideas, and my efforts over the years become complete cunts when they heard all of 3 seconds of this idea."
changemyview,"You have asserted that the people who would not join an MLM, are those who are; smart, driven, and/or, well connected. And while you are likely correct that many smart, driven, and/or well connected individuals will likely avoid MLMs, your assertion fails to entertain a certain subset of individuals who exploit the structure of MLMs.   I am refering to those individuals who are aware that the company is an MLM and that the likely hood of actually making it big are slim to none, but they join because they are smart driven and well connected, and they use their intelligence as a point of leverage in exploiting their network of friends and family, which they acquired from being well connected, and they continue to do so because of their drive. It is a short term solution to a lack of money, and one that require there be no remorse for essentially stealing from your friends and family. but these people do exist and unfortunately in such a large number that MLMs can actually bank on there being enough of these individuals to help drive their profits higher."
changemyview,"This is a passage from one of the best books I've read, and I think it's appropriate here:   > Good Form   >It's time to be blunt.   >I'm forty-three years old, true, and I'm a writer now, and a long time ago I walked through Quang Ngai Province as a foot soldier.   >Almost everything else is invented.   >But it's not a game. It's a form. Right here, now, as I invent myself, I'm thinking of all I want to tell you about why this book is written as it is. For instance, I want to tell you this: twenty years ago I watched a man die on a trail near the village of My Khe. I did not kill him. But I was present you see, and my presence was guilt enough. I remember his face, which was not a pretty face, because his jaw was in his throat, and I remember feeling the burden of responsibility and grief. I blamed myself. And rightly so, because I was present.   >But listen. Even that story is made up.   >I want you to feel what I felt. I want you to know why story-truth is truer sometimes than happening-truth.   >Here is the happening-truth. I was once a soldier. There were many bodies, real bodies with real faces, but I was young then and I was afraid to look. And now, twenty years later, I'm left with faceless responsibility and faceless grief.   >Here is the story-truth. He was a slim, , almost dainty young man of about twenty. He lay in the center of a red clay trail near the village of My Khe. His jaw was in his throat. His one eye was shut, the other eye was a star-shaped hole. I killed him.   >What stories can do, I guess, is make things present.   >I can look at things I never looked at. I can attach faces to grief and love and pity and God. I can be brave. I can make myself feel again.   >"Daddy, tell the truth," Kathleen can say, "did you ever kill anybody?" And I can say, honestly, "Of course not."   >Or I can say, honestly, "Yes."   > - Tim O'Brien,  The Things They Carried   Fiction is not about getting to the simple truth of events. The events don't matter. If you just want to know  what  happened, the sources you mentioned are perfectly sufficient. Fiction is about getting to the heart of things. Fiction is about telling you  why  things happen. In the best fiction, you see the world--or invented world--from the eyes of the author and the characters. This can't really happen in non-fiction. Nonfiction deals with fact, or the best idea of fact, as far as we can see. The subjective is an enemy of nonfiction, and every time subjective things are mentioned, fiction begins to mingle with that nonfiction. You cannot see inside another's mind simply by looking at fact."
changemyview,"It sounds like (and please bear in mind I have never met you and may completely have missed the mark) you developed this idea of yourself, as a person who relies entirely on logic and reason, above most emotions. I felt that way for a long time, and eventually talked to a therapist about it, among other things. He was very keen to stress that the human brain is a fucking mess. People tend to have constant conflicting emotions, thoughts and desires. Most often if you find yourself unable to understand or empathise it's not because you lack something. For me I thought I was unable to appreciate poetry or music because I was the wrong sort of person, I was a mathematician, but just talking to other people about their passions has certainly opened doors in my understanding.  I can draw lots of parallels, the satisfaction of finishing an intricately crafted story, which ties together plot points and themes, is exactly how I feel about solving complex algebra."
changemyview,"Fundamentally, Science is simply the pursuit of knowledge.   > Science, as it is today, has the belief, or the faith, that the universe has 1) rules 2) which can be observed by humans.   Lets replace that with "scientists" first, nitpicking over. We definitely believe that there are some rules that exist and can be observed and understood and this is only believed because we have seen this time and time again, in repeatable ways. To say this is true for  all  aspects of the universe is completely unfounded. There are many question we de not know the answer to and probably never will, such as what came before the big bang. To this end "human perfection in understanding" is almost certainly not achievable, we can only get closer.   As /u/Bhorzo said many people, actually the majority of people do not have an understanding of science and have to believe what is said purely on faith. Yes many think science offers a way out of all of our problems, sometime true, often not. In this sense you are correct.   The answers that have been found out by science would be found out again by a different species on a different planet in a different part of the universe. Probably in a different order and definitely with different names, but in the end the answers would be the same. This cannot even be said for religions on different continents.   Scientists do not absolutely believe in  anything  we can state exactly what our assumptions are for any known fact. these assumptions can always be challenged. Science is also useful and has undeniably increased our understanding of the universe, evidenced by the level to which we can now control the world around us."
changemyview,"Discouragement and teasing about overweight people's bodies does more harm than good. Teasing lowers self-esteem, and [this study]( found that being part of a friend group that was preoccupied with body image lead individuals to have more body image issues and more disordered eating behaviors. Eating disorders are the [most deadly mental disorders]( with high rates of suicide contributing to that death toll. In addition, stress in general has a whole host of negative health effects. I don't think there are numbers on this, but it would not surprise me if part of the correlation between poor health and obesity is from stress due to the stigma associated with being overweight or obese.   Obesity also [may not actually cause poor health]( It may be that many of the diseases associated with obesity actually cause the obesity. For instance, there's evidence that [diabetes may cause obesity]( rather than the other way around. Thyroid disorders can also cause obesity. And studies have shown that [gut bacteria plays a big role]( and obese mice can lose weight by getting a transplant of gut bacteria from skinny mice. Working out is not all it takes for everyone to lose weight. And if people are unsuccessful at weight loss, it may lead to more stress and actually hurt their health. In addition, it seems like exercise habits and diet have a bigger impact on health than obesity, so a skinny couch potato may be less healthy than an active overweight or obese person.   Therefore, teasing fat people or pointing our that they are fat most likely causes them to be  less  healthy than if you said nothing.   Fat positivity, on the other hand, is associated with  better health outcomes . They're mental health will likely also be much improved, which will more likely than not lead them to be more healthy."
changemyview,"can you source that? I have heard that fact in the past but havent seen a source.   Not the person you're replying to, but:   > ##Perceived Weight Discrimination and Obesity >  Angelina R. Sutin mail, Antonio Terracciano  >  Published: Jul 24, 2013DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0070048   > ###Abstract   > Weight discrimination is prevalent in American society. Although associated consistently with psychological and economic outcomes, less is known about whether weight discrimination is associated with longitudinal changes in obesity. The objectives of this research are (1) to test whether weight discrimination is associated with risk of becoming obese (Body Mass Index鈮?0; BMI) by follow-up among those not obese at baseline, and (2) to test whether weight discrimination is associated with risk of remaining obese at follow-up among those already obese at baseline.   >Participants were drawn from the Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey of community-dwelling US residents. A total of 6,157 participants (58.6% female) completed the discrimination measure and had weight and height available from the 2006 and 2010 assessments. Participants who experienced weight discrimination were approximately 2.5 times more likely to become obese by follow-up (OR = 2.54, 95% CI = 1.58鈥?.08) and participants who were obese at baseline were three times more likely to remain obese at follow up (OR = 3.20, 95% CI = 2.06鈥?.97) than those who had not experienced such discrimination.   > These effects held when controlling for demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, education) and when baseline BMI was included as a covariate. These effects were also specific to weight discrimination; other forms of discrimination (e.g., sex, race) were unrelated to risk of obesity at follow-up. The present research demonstrates that, in addition to poorer mental health outcomes, weight discrimination has implications for obesity. Rather than motivating individuals to lose weight, weight discrimination increases risk for obesity.   [Source]("
changemyview,"This may be guiding off point, but I think the major conceit here is that for the people saying, "you're beautiful," their intention was that they actually find the person attractive and are informing them thus. For most people fat is unattractive. And for the friends of the person who are fat, they probably feel that. But they don't want to make their friend feel bad, they want to make them feel good; so they lie a little, because they aren't as concerned about judging their friend's attractiveness.   Attractiveness, is however, something they (and all of us) are judged on. Obesity is related to all sorts of health problems, and no, telling a person not to change will not lead them to a healthier lifestyle. But, point in fact, while we should be concerned with a person's health, we aren't only talking about how a person is health-wise when we talk about weight; we're talking about a person's appearance as well.   I make this point because we've gotten to a place where "fat" equates in most people's minds as "unattractive" AND "unhealthy." The two now seem reflexive with one another, but they are separate reasons for discussing obesity; if you're concerned for someone's health, because they're fat, that may be a noble endeavor. But for the person looking at the fat girl posting a selfie on facebook, you're probably thinking that she is unattractive. So he, in his honesty, wants to tell her that he finds her unattractive. And being unattractive is wrong in this culture right?   So in the facebook scenario: OP is a jerk for judging the selfie-girl: its not noble to tell someone they're unattractive for any reason. It's just OP projecting his values of beauty on another person. To OP's credit, she's posting to Facebook's "Cutest Teens," so she is probably concerned to some degree about her appearance. She might be a self-righteous bitch, and she's deluded into thinking she's pretty and everyone should like her for it. Or maybe she does feel ugly and maybe she's desperate for a little attention, and wants to see herself be praised for her appearance for once. Her friends then post to support her endeavors, because they're her friends. Ultimately, they're all in the wrong because they choose to express their judgement, or idea of self-worth, or support through the lens of appearance and attractiveness, rather than a more worth while or mature one.   At least when the friends get indignant on people like OP - who probably isn't an asshole, but probably had no business commenting on this girls picture, because it obviously wasn't intended for him - they can go home and say, "I wanted my friend to know I support her.""
changemyview,"There are a lot of different kinds of medications in the world, and a good doctor will help someone with symptoms find the medication that alleviates the symptoms with the fewest number of drawbacks.  Most things you go through change who you are, if you're paying attention. The issue with medication is that it helps people with things they  don't  like. Things that are more like abnormalities that are getting in the way of their life.  Taking a medication that helps you hold down a steady job is a great thing if that's been a problem, and a good doctor will try combinations of medications that can help you with the side effects."
changemyview,"The claim is that a hypothetical, or inevitable, ultimate intelligence may punish those who fail to help it or help create it, with greater punishment given to those who knew the importance of the task in advance.   The real question is why we're attributing an arbitrarily negative emotional state to a hypothetical ultimate intelligence.   I assume the basis of this "punishment" is that singularity must be brought about as swiftly as possible so that as much growth as possible can be achieved in a given time period. A self-interested intelligence is sort of a stretch, but a more realistic assumption than merely a malicious one.   Given that goal, wasting resources on "torture" would be pointless, even if only in the context of providing a motivator in the basilisk. Unless we're also assuming time travel is possible, any failure to bring about singularity as quickly as possible can't be rectified in retrospect, even if everyone knows about the basilisk. In economic terms, it'd be a "sunk cost" and actually following through on the "torture" would be a pointless waste of resources."
changemyview,"I get where you're coming from. I'm currently having a big religious inner turmoil but for the  most part I'm agnostic and really big into science so that makes that truth even harder to cope with.  I'm not gonna try to change your view in the traditional sense but show you why you shouldn't worry.  I think this is all the occupational hazard of being this species that we have become so  conscious  that we see and perceive the beginning and end of our lives but the beginning and end of time. However, from an early age the smallest things around us seemed so big so the idea of our lives being obsolete is like being suffocated in a way.  But here's why it doesn't depress me.  It makes me hopeful that humans will never run out of things to do.  Technology will keep progressing, there will always be a new frontier and so life will always have some sort of conquest, a thing to desire.  (I even have this idea of heaven where you become privy to knowledge you never had.  To the extent of being able to see what one Eskimo man was doing the day after the Battle of the Bulge.  All information you can see).  And so that makes me happy.  On top of that, I think the depression we feel at feeling pointless in this world is not alleviated through war, love, and jobs etc. because of a conspiracy, I think it's because of our biology.  Humans are fundamentally social creatures and lack of society gives us anxiety but being in the thick of it calms us.  I don't think it's conspiracy; it's natural to react like that. I hope that helped!"
changemyview,"It's important to note that you're sweeping a  huge  number of people under the term "Republicans". I find it unlikely that you could find many who embrace all the contradictions you outline. It's much more likely that most "Republicans" would agree with some of the beliefs you ascribe to them, but not the rest, and would contradict themselves much less you think and probably not more than any normal person.   Even though I can't speak for all "Republicans" I do agree (generally) more with their political platform than the Democrats, so let me do what I can to briefly clarify my views. You may or may not find this useful.   1) I think you're confusing social conservatives with economic conservatives. Republicans typically are in favor of smaller government for economic reasons (at least, I am). We think that the Federal government is going to be less efficient than the State governments due to less familiarity with the issues involved and an overwhelming tendency for things to get lost in bureaucracy. As to the government's role in society, we all recognize that there is a fundamental difference between what is legal and what is moral. There are many things I consider to be wrong that I wouldn't dream of trying to pass a law against in the name of free action. However, some conservatives may consider certain things to be bad  enough  for society that they're worth criminalizing. Different Republicans will draw that line differently.   2) Huge military spending is something a lot of people see as necessary, especially in a world where most of our allies are spending a lot less on the military. Take the recent troubles in Ukraine, for instance. I personally think it isn't going to amount to much and that Putin isn't going to invade Ukraine, but if they did...what would happen? France, Germany, Britain, none of them have near the military strength to credibly threaten or dissuade Russia. We do. As for the other issues, I think you're misrepresenting how Republicans think the economy works. I wont' get in to the specific arguments here unless you're interested, but Republicans want a better economy and they think that both smaller government and less taxes (across the board, which includes the rich) both facilitate that. You may disagree, but there is no hypocrisy here.   3) I have never met a conservative who opposes same-sex marriage but is in favor of divorce or premarital sex. Same-sex marriage happens to be a political issue right now; that's why you hear about it a lot more. For my own part, I think it's beneficial to have an institution devoted to a stable romantic relationship organized around the raising and care of children, but I don't think making divorce, same-sex marriage, or premarital sex illegal are good ideas (complicated, don't want to get in to right now).   4) As above, there's a difference between what is moral and what is legal and people make that distinction in different places. I don't think it's hypocrisy to disagree on where to draw the line.   5) Many of the Republicans in your life probably have a  very  different idea of the importance of life than you do. For them, an embryo is valuable because it is a live human being (ideas of "personhood" aside, that's a whole other discussion) and a hardened criminal is no less valuable in that sense. However, a criminal has, through free choice, betrayed his/her commitment to society and some punishment is required. Depending on the severity of the crime the death penalty may be appropriate. My own view is that every human life is valuable and that the only time the death penalty would be appropriate is if keeping a criminal alive is, somehow, a great danger to others (even if locked up). I can't think of any actual examples here, but a fictional character like The Joker may be deserving of the death penalty.   To sum up, I think what you are interpreting as hypocrisy is merely difference of opinion, but the issues are complex enough that you can round off their beliefs to things that seem contradictory. I could do the same thing to liberals, here are a few examples:   1) Liberals claim to uphold free action for everyone, but they want to force religious institutions to perform gay marriages against their wishes. 2) Liberals claim to hold life as valuable, but want to slaughter the most innocent among us (children in the womb). 3) Liberals claim to want equality, but they are in favor of affirmative action, which discriminates against white males.   Obviously I don't believe any of those 3 statements are true, but they  seem  plausible on first glance. A real liberal would (correctly) claim that I was simplifying, misinterpreting, and (perhaps deliberately) misunderstanding their positions. I think you are doing the same thing to Republicans.   I apologize for the length of the response. I'm in the middle of lab work right now and typed this up without sufficient time to proof-read. Please forgive any spelling errors or poorly written sentences. Let me know if you want to get into any of the issues in greater depth."
changemyview,"Person who grew up with a younger brother with severe disabilities here. Also have a grandma and an uncle with disabilities, too. This is a question I often wonder myself, but I'm going to make my best effort to help take you into my world. I should clarify that not all people with disabilities are as challenged as my brother, but I think the fears and emotions are still the same.   Hardly anyone willingly chooses this, god knows we never did. We all have an assumption that we will grow up, raise our kids, send them to a nice college. There will be some drama, but everything's going to be all right... so we think. Most people never consider this life an option. They don't anticipate a moment where their child might accidentally stray out into a street and might not see the car. They don't anticipate a moment after many long hours of labor that their son might have a freak genetic disorder. But these things happen to our families, whether we asked for them or not.   Don't get us wrong. We mourn the loss of a typical life. Dreams of an honor roll student? Gone. Hours of going out, throwing footballs and fishing at the lake? Gone. Laughing at all the dumb shit he and his friends do when they're over at your house? Not happening. Meeting the girlfriend? You know better than to hope. We DO wish that our loved ones could run, read, communicate with our words, but they are what they are. They never chose it, but there you are. Some families cannot handle this loss and they will mourn it for as long as they care for their child. I've seen these... all they talk about is their hardships, how they can never do the things they want. They're like the morbidly obese person you know that has all these health problems, but will never change their diet or go to the gym. Sometimes it's a damn competition to see who has it worse. This depression drives them mad, and understandably so.   My family wasn't like that. We collectively agreed, "Well, this sucks," but we never took the time to feel sorry for ourselves. We resolved to do our best to be like everyone else. We take my brother out to eat, to Disney World, to visit relatives... we do everything typically developing people can. We also try to give him the best education we can (therapy, teaching functional skills, limited sign language, anything that might help). We know damn well he's never going to be at our level, but that doesn't mean we're not going to try. Anything we would have given a typically developing student, he's going to get too. Somewhere along the way, you discover that even though they'll never be able to take care of themselves, there's still merits. They still smile, laugh, and are sometimes better people to be around than you are. Just because they can't write an essay detailing their love, they still get their meaning across when they hug you after you've been gone for months. They still know happiness, joy, frustration, loneliness... they just communicate it differently and you learn to understand them.   I would say our family is far from miserable... and we've seen some shit.   Anyway, to"
changemyview,"It goes wider than that I believe.   Recent research has shown that [couples without children are happier](  Its just one study so its not very conclusive but there is a need in modern society to just "feel so blessed" by having children.   For some people there is also a religious component to this.   So even though a child is a small sociopath that wont let you sleep,  spends tons of your savings etc etc, we must be grateful for our little angles.   and I am sure a lot of people feel they are.   When you end up with a child that mentally handicapped, physically handicapped or both, you take on a lot more work than regular parents have, but again you are required to tell everyone that its wonderful and how special their child is.   But behind the scenes there is a lot of pain, extremely hard work, even more money going out.   I have known two families who had children with disabilities that I were very close to. And the children do feel joy sometimes. and they do love them very much, but they are also honest at least with me that its a hell of a job.   The edge cases we get now with the possibilities of ending a pregnancy if the child is found to have certain defects.  This makes a lot of people feel like we are calling them subhuman and how they would never exist if such things were common years ago.   And how we will rob those kids of their existence.   I find this to be a very difficult question. It would seem on the face of it that being able to have healthy children would be a great thing."
changemyview,"Okay, let me start off by saying I enjoyed Bioshock Infinite immensely. I bought it day one and was happy with my time with it. It is definitely a good game, and an enjoyable game. The setting is awe inspiring and very unique and many would agree that it was one of the best games of 2013, as evident with the Metacritic score.   That said, there are plenty of ways in which it didn't impress enough to be classified as the "greatest game of all time" by a large amount of people. I personally do not think you will see this game thrown around as people's favorite game in 10 years, the same way Zelda, Halo 2, (etc) is today. But let's get into it.   For one, gameplay.  The gameplay was a typical shooter, which if you like that, wasn't a bad thing. The problem however, lies within the repetitive nature of the combat. You are limited to only two weapons at once the entire game meaning you have to pick your weapons carefully. This doesn't encourage playing around, instead if pushes you to choose one or two you like and stick with it. Besides that, Vigors, while fun, were never radical enough to be in the front of your mind. Because most of them were simply assets in combat instead of it's focus, I personally found myself forgetting to use them multiple times. Together this meant combat that remained relatively static the entire game. Combat didn't ever truly change with the introduction of new vigors, it was more like getting a new type of grenade.   And besides that, I found player movement speed to be slow in a way that felt detrimental to the game. Walking but also reloading. It made sense as an aid to atmosphere in the original murky hallways of Bioshock, but in bright open Columbia, it didn't really aid the atmosphere and instead just slowed things down. The skyhooks helped with this, but again they weren't present most of the game, or dynamic enough to truly change the combat. Instead they just moved you around, or were used as way to regen some health.   Next, the level design itself.   Personally, I found this the most disappointing aspect of Bioshock Infinite. Columbia had such a beautiful world and atmosphere, but unfortunately by the end of the game I realized I hadn't experienced most of it because Bioshock Infinite was incredibly linear. This isn't necessarily a bad thing until you pair it with static combat, and then have most of the game be combat, and then design all the levels around this combat. Think about it like this, how cool would it be to show Elizabeth's tower off in the distance and then allow the player a few different routes to get there. Imagine jumping off one "island" and being able to skyhook over. Really think about the amazing possibilities a city like Columbia could offer (acknowledging hardware constraints etc), and then contrast that with the multitude of similar balcony's, hallways, and plazas we just had to walk through or occasionally sky hook past in linear sequences or cutscenes. If I remember right, one of the most open parts of the game was simply a big circle.   Lastly, the narrative. Potential Spoiler warning.   Bioshock infinite's best parts were story, but even then it didn't nail all of it. It toyed with various themes other games have not dared to touch (which is awesome) but it didn't nail them. It detailed certain problems within Columbia, but it never really did anything with them. Did the narrative really address the problems of racism or class division in Columbia, or connect them to religion, or to patriotism? No. It showed them, beautifully sure, but just as quick as we saw many of these issues we were rushed away to another, or moved on to the more relevant theme that was quantum mechanics. It's been talked to death, but narrative-dissonance was a big issue with Bioshock Infinite. And ultimately the story has a few inconsequential steps that seem to cater to these themes that (again) are not completely relevant to Booker, and Elizabeth's goals.   Many people before have said that they felt as though the combat was just a barrier to get into more of the story. Unfortunately a good amount of the story itself is presented around combat and actual gameplay. Not just in level design, eg. "here is the working class area" but also in providing an excuse for combat. eg. "In this timeline the resistance force want you dead, because you were really helpful as a martyr, and it would hurt the resistance if people knew you were back (which doesn't make a lot of sense considering half of the resistance force is actively trying to kill you...)." Overall, Infinite has a good narrative, and the last 30 minutes or so are quite memorable, especially among fans of the previous Bioshock. But the game walks a fine line between catering to the reason for combat/gameplay, and the overhead plot, to its detriment.   I have and would continue to recommend Bioshock infinite because it is still a fun game. Combat is alright despite being largely static, and the world is beautiful even if the level design doesn't always take advantage the way it could. The narrative is fun to follow, and the end twist is great. But by no means is it the greatest game of all time, or even (in my opinion obviously) of 2013.   So to make a long post short,"
changemyview,"should" is a very hard thing to enforce. Should we exercise? give money to the poor? be nice people? We should do many things. A more practical question is "Does an immigrant need to learn the language of the country they move to?"   The difficulty of the language is not really the major factor. The major factor is why should we learn the language in the first place. Language has GREAT economic and sociocultural incentives.   For the most part, most immigrants can speak the language of their native country. Consider how a immigrant arrives in the first place. They need a visa and most visas are granted through work or study, which requires language fluency. The majority of non-speaking immigrant are most likely family members/refugees or some other special cases.   Having a community means there a subculture large enough that supports their sociocultural and economic needs in a foreign language. This eliminates many benefits and ultimate destroys their motivation.   If most personal benefits are gone, then we must consider societal benefits.  Let's ignore a moral argument that all discrimination is bad and stay with an economic view. If no one accommodates immigrants, the inconvenience will motivate them to learn the language. Being completely reliant on a translator is costly and is insanely annoying. However, if the benefits outweigh the costs, most businesses will just incur a higher transaction cost and find ways to communicate (pictures, learning their language, etc). This balance is ultimately governed by market forces."
changemyview,"one person should not be able to compel another to do something they don't want to protect the first person. That is simply tyranny.   Like it or not you are a participant in society.

Certain rights take precedence over other rights.  In this case the right to life for others takes precedence over your right to make an ignorant choice.   This is a clear case where 2 rights can conflict with each other.  Your fundamental right to choose in regards to your own body or your children, dangers the fundamental right to life of those around you/your children.  In this case whose right do we respect more?  The right of personal choice or the right of life?   Also Children have rights independent of their parents.  So even based on ignorance as you claim why does the parents right of ignorance supersede the childs right to safe health?  We've already seen with cases of Faith-healing that parents have an obligation to their children to keep them as safe and healthy as possible.  If they are willfully and ignorantly denying their child access to vaccinations which keep them healthy and prevent deadly diseases then they are not fulfilling their obligation to their child and again they're forcing their personal right of choice to take precedence over the personal right of life of others.   You do not have a greater right to choose to endanger the lives of those around you than those people have a right to not be endangered by choice."
changemyview,"I work at Five Guys Burger and Fries. All I can say is that the lettuce we use is very crisp and crunchy, which is how it should be. It adds texture to the soft bun and patty and if you're a bacon fan then it adds to that very well. Also it seperate a the thinner sauces like A1 and hot sauce from the bun because it is over the sauces."
changemyview,"Lettuce is bland and does not contribute any kind of worthwhile flavor to a burger.   Not flavour, but fresh lettuce can add texture, which is also a part of taste.   >Lettuce detracts from the delicate balance of flavors that makes a burger a burger.   If it is really as bland as you say, it can't really change the flavour, now can it?   >The shape of lettuce can often disrupt the even distribution of the sauces, causing it to pool in undesirable ways.   This can be solved by properly stacking a burger, in particular the size of the sauce portion. Basically, if the sauce leaks it is too much.   >In larger burgers, lettuce just makes it more difficult to fit the burger in your mouth.   In larger burgers, the fact that it is a large burger makes it more difficult to fit the burger in your mouth. The lettuce doesn't really change that.   >Lettuce is a cheap way for restaurants to make their small burgers seem bigger.   Lettuce, at least fresh lettuce, isn't that cheap. It spoils quite quickly when it gets oxygen. A lot of lettuce gets thrown away.   >If you want veggies on your burger, there are plenty of delicious options (onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, peppers, mushrooms, pickles) [If you are a fan of Ronald Reagan, add Ketchup to the list.]   And lettuce is also an option. In fact, lettuce is found in a vast majority of burger recipes. To the point that most people don't even consider it optional at all. There is a cultural dimension to food as well, which mainly pertains to eating habits and recipes. From that perspective, if many people consider lettuce should be on their burger, it damn well should be.   >Freshly washed lettuce that is not properly dried can add extra unwanted moisture that can make the bread soggy and destabilize the consistency of the sauces.   Sogginess is most often the result of too much sauce or a too greasy burger. The bit of water from the lettuce does not have a meaningful contribution.   >Sure, lettuce might be the lowest calorie part of your burger, but if you are truly concerned with cutting calories, put down to double bacon chee and order a salad already.   Not sure how this relates to your point. If you want to cut calories, don't get a burger. Burgers (except for the cheap $1 burgers) are designed to be a full meal's worth of calories in a single sandwich. If you're on any sort of diet, don't get a burger. Get something you can control serving size on, and get a small serving."

changemyview,"Rather than saying "look at all the atrocities that are allowed, what does one more matter", you should be saying "at least there is one atrocity less that's allowed."   As argued by others, I find all exploitation of animals messed up, it's only natural that we'd try to prevent what we can. The farming industry however is much more internalized and much more difficult to try to fix.   The next step would be to ban artificial insemination, but that'll cost the farm multinationals a lot of money, which means lots of lobbying against it, which means it is very difficult to pass. All we can do is protest by example and try our best to make some changes."
changemyview,"Just to be completely open before I start, I'm using a throwaway account. I'm normally pretty shameless on Reddit, but I prefer anonymity when discussing this aspect of my past.   When I was between 12 and 16, I was what you would classify as "otherkin." I wholeheartedly and unequivocally believed that I was part werewolf. I can assure you that it is indeed  very  possible to believe that you are some sort of mythical creature. I can't tell you why everyone does, but I can tell you some of the factors that led to my adoption of the idea.   When I was younger, I wouldn't exactly call myself very popular-- at least, not how the term is popularly connoted. Most everyone else knew me in the same way that you would "know" that one chair that squeaks a bit when you lean back. I was nothing more or less than a quirk in the background noise of reality. I was only approached when people wanted something. That pattern continued until I met my first true friend. We'll call him S.   To say that S was imaginative is an understatement. He was able to immediately concoct elaborate storylines with a variety of challenges for us to overcome. It was normal enough at first. After all, children regularly role-play as part of their socialization. It's not uncommon for them to play as implausible heroes in impossible situations. It's also not uncommon for particular characters to reoccur often. But after a while, our adventures started taking a turn towards what was retrospectively bizarre but what was, at the time, fantastic: We started to believe that we somehow embodied these characters in a more literal sense. The more we played, the more these personalities solidified in our minds and they eventually emerged as aspects of our actual selves.   I've read through most of the comments in this CMV, so I'm going to address the elephant in the room: "How could anyone believe that they were actually the people they played?" Honestly, I couldn't give you a complete answer. What I will do is give you my best theory.   Around this time, S and I started to seriously hit puberty. Our bodies were literally changing at incredible rates. We found ourselves measurably stronger and more adept at certain tasks in a few months time-- a rate that we naively thought was superhuman. We were seemingly converging on the characters that we assumed during play. I can't be entirely sure, but I would bet that our thought process was this:   1) We pretend to be these characters. This means that they exist somewhere in our minds. 2) We were seemingly growing to a strength that these characters possessed.  Conclusion: The reason we were thinking about them and the reason we were growing to be like them is because we  really  were them. The purpose of our games were congruent to the purpose of young tigers play-fighting: To prepare ourselves for what we would actually become.   I have to stress that this is retrospective because if I didn't it might appear that this conclusion dawned on us like an epiphany. It didn't. It was slowly adopted by our minds. Which is much more dangerous. Time gives the opportunity for falsehoods to solidify through the mounting of improbable "evidence."   The strength and confidence of being a werewolf is utterly addicting. Remember those moments of awkwardness and uncertainty that came with being a preteen/young teenager? Well that must have been a problem for you, mere mortal, because I had the blood of a fucking monster and monsters don't have to worry about your banal trivialities. I understand how implausible and absurd this line of thought seems, but could you imagine how unbelievably  liberating  it can be? It gave me a way to cope with a reality that I was just struggling to understand. A reality that I was feeling more and more isolated from as every day passed. It was a vicious cycle: The more people rejected me for my other idiosyncrasies (I was a very nerdy kid and my choice of sports was never exactly popular) the more I withdrew into my being a werewolf. The more I withdrew into being a werewolf, the more confident I was in my current idiosyncrasies and the more others started to sneak in. Soon, a small group of people recognized pattern and knew the mechanism, knew that I was a beast. They knew from experience.   This is where I met some of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life. It turns out that others were just like me. They had "others" either inside them or embodied by their minds and souls. They were open with me, included me, and we all felt a sense of kinship. We were a family of outcasts and misfits. You'd be amazed at how many people latched on to this idea or actively enabled it. I met three of my girlfriends through connections in the group and two of them were active participants. And I can assure you that every single person in that was in this group was just as sincere in their beliefs as I was in mine.   At one point in the comments, I saw the OP and a few others express doubt at the sincerity of some believers due to the fact that they don't embody all the behaviors that their "trapped" personalities would ostensibly entail. (I think the example used is that kids aren't flinging themselves into the streets like hedgehogs so they have to at least be aware that they aren't entirely hedgehogs). From my experience, the exact opposite is true. I was  so  sure that I was a werewolf, so committed to the belief, that I did my damnedest to ensure that no one outside the group would find out. I recognized that we were in a human world and if we wanted to survive without being ostracized, we had to act as normally as possible. That meant subduing the more visible aspects of yourself so that you could have as normal a life as possible. Imagine being a transgender individual in a time before it was more socially acceptable. You felt like an outsider unfairly born into a world that would reject your actual self. Many simply repressed themselves to get along as well as they could, but some people were more vocal about it. As such, they were rejected, shunned, and faced threats of violence. Those "attention seeking kids" on Tumblr aren't much different. They're bullheaded-- the world ought to accept them for who they are! And then they're subsequently shunned, rejected, and (at least in high school) recipients of very real threats of violence. Some of the more "visible" members got picked on relentlessly. They'd get targeted for coordinated harassment campaigns by certain cliques that only thought of them as "that fuckin' weird kid in my gym class." I know people who got the shit beaten out of them because someone would get carried away. In the face of this very real adversity, do you think that most of us would be stupid enough to chase traffic? I would say that we just wanted to be normal, but that's not entirely accurate. The reason that I was first attracted to the seemingly innocent practice to begin with was because I  was  normal. I was just a quirk in the background noise, remember? I think I subliminally recognized that everyone else was too. If normal involved loneliness and uncertainty then I wanted out. I wanted to be the kind of normal that I observed in some adults and pop-culture heroes. I wanted to be confident and unwavering. Everyone in the group was in the pursuit of this idealized normalcy. It would be many years before I realized that there is no such thing as unwavering confidence. That even heroes face hardship and doubt.   (Again, when I say "I thought" and "I wanted" it has to be clear that these weren't my contemporaneous conscious thoughts. These phrases are the product of a retrospective analysis. I can be sure of those things now. At the time, I was only sure of what I thought I was and what I actually wasn't: A werewolf trapped in a human world).   I eventually left the idea, but it wasn't exactly easy. I spent a good portion of my developmentally crucial years convincing myself of a fantastical falsehood. It took a lot of time to rewrite myself. To find other means to embody the confidence and assurance that I now realize was the driving force behind my behavior. But not everybody leaves. And of those that do, not everyone manages to return in one piece.   I'm sure you can sit here and diagnose some sort of psychological condition. In fact, I'd be stupid to think that you already haven't. But I can offer nothing more than the most sincere assurance that I was sane. I understood the reality that most people experience and I "understood" levels that I thought simply existed beyond it. And please do not use my usage of the term "beyond it" as an excuse to debase religiosity.  The wiring is similar but not identical. I knew people who were hardcore Christians that justified there existence through convoluted interpretations of scripture. I knew others that were atheists and just thought that we were special via other rationalizations. (In fact, I can remember a couple of instances where Christian proponents debated Atheist ones. It's interesting to watch a Vampire debate a Monster on the virtues of faith). I can't speak for everyone, but I know that my evolution was probably a product of some twisted form of rationalization (see the part about 1. 2. and Conclusion above). I don't think I was deranged. Stupid? Absolutely. Embarrassingly accepting of the supernatural? You bet. But if you allow for people to believe in the existence of something, anything, that could exist beyond our mortal ken and they are in desperate need of some sort of strength to understand an uncertain world, I would say that it isn't insane, irrational, or some sophomoric attempt to get attention. Sadly, it can make all the sense in the world."
changemyview,"For me, it's not that I don't think it's a legitimate way to become a known performer - it's that the shows aren't really about uncovering talent.   These shows go under the guise that they're about finding talented performers and musicians, but their selection process is not designed for it. They don't evaluate a persons musical ability, their song writing abilities, or anything that would determine them to be a gifted musician/performer.   What these shows are doing is finding a 'product'. They are basically scouting for new pop prospects that they can sell. The whole show is about building people's media presence up. The record companies love this model - they don't have to individually scout talent - they can have it all come to them. They don't have to promote them - the TV show does that. They don't even have to pay for it - they actually make the audience pay for it with their viewing and with their votes.   You can often see this is the case by their comments when reviewing people. I recall one audition where a girl came in and sang a blues/jazz tune. Her voice was pretty good, but Simon Cowell criticised her for not being 'current'. That to me was these talent shows in a nutshell. He was not looking at her talent, her musical ability - he was looking purely at her commercial value. She wasn't hugely attractive, she wasn't singing popular songs, and so she had little value to the show. It's also the reason they spend so long on their sob stories - they want to build followings for these people so when they finally make their records, they have a big market to sell them too.   You can also see this in their high label turnover following their initial signing. Most of them get signed to Simon Cowell's label - Syco Records (at least here in the UK they do, there may be a different label in the US). If you look at their former artists, you can see how quickly they were dropped after their initial appeal wore off. If they truly believed that this person was one of the most talented people in the country - they'd put a hell of a lot more effort into developing them into a serious artist."
changemyview,"While it is nice to equate allied countries to partners in a relationship, it's a pretty flawed metaphor. Interpersonal relationships are built on trust, international ones are not.   Let's look at a human relationship. Let's say your SO is cheating on you. You have no idea. Without any warning, he/she leaves you and runs off with this other person. You are left broken hearted. You are left worse off after this relationship than you were at the beginning.   Now, looking at the same relationship, let's say you've seen some of your SO's texts to this other person about the scandal. You are distraught, but now that you know about the cheating you are now in power to end the relationship as you see fit. Because you have this information, you break up with your SO. You are unhappy that it came to this, but at the end of the day you are better off knowing about it and getting to make your own decisions about your life than being in the dark and getting blindsided when he/she leaves.   This is not a healthy, human relationship. In order to establish a true bond with somebody, you must trust them to act with both their own and your own best interests in mind. Sadly, relationships often don't go this way, but, having my fair share of both good and bad relationships, I feel safe saying that a healthy romantic relationship is one where each partner takes into account the wishes and feelings of the other, and those of the "couple" as a collective entity.   I agree that if your SO cheats on you and leaves you that it is rough for you, and that you may arguably have been left better off if you had "spied" and found out for yourself before your world came crashing down on your head. However, thinking about personal relationships this way is poisonous, as establishing a human connection with somebody, a relationship that you feel is stable enough to invest in a future with the other person (whether it be through having kids, mortgaging a home, etc.), is not about who has more information, more power over the other.   Global politics ARE about information and power. Your allies are not your significant others. At the end of the day, you act--and are expected to act--with your own best interests in mind, placing the well-being of your own citizens above any other concerns.   Countries don't align because they feel that they are ready to build a future together, to live the rest of their lives together, and to settle down and procreate. Instead, alliances are formed because it is mutually beneficial--for the time being--for them to do so. Complete trust is something that should be limited to interactions between one human and another.   So no. The US and Germany (let's say as an example of an ally we are spying on) are not partners. We have similar interests, for the time being, but we are not in a relationship. We are allies, and alliances can turn sour at any moment in time. Being left with no plan and no information to go on when one partner suddenly decides to leave can be very dangerous when it comes to international politics.   It's not ok to spy on your girlfriend. I fully agree with you there. But you just can't draw parallels between a romantic human relationship and one between distinctly different countries with different populations, different national values, and potentially different views for the future."
changemyview,"G'day OP, I've just finished writing a big essay on this sort of topic so I'll chime in and give a summary of what I can.   Firstly, what you're arguing is summed up in corporate social responsibility (CSR). There are varying degrees of this: a book by Secchi defines three business views of CSR: utilitarian, managerial and relational, which I'll come back to shortly. Basically, each view of CSR defines exactly how firms view their interaction with society and the wider world. You've said that firms aim to maximise their profits, which is true: though depending on their CSR view, firms view how far their profits can be maximised in different ways, not all of which are sociopathic or, as I'm sure you are implying,  unethical . Of course business aim to return money to their owner(s) - that's what they're in the game for. How they go about it, though, is where things get tricky.   OK, so let's run through the varying degrees of how an organisation can view itself in terms of its social responsibility. First, there's utilitarian: this is where the company views itself purely as an economic actor, and is required to maximise its return to shareholders. There is argument that this, in itself, is ethical - provided the company operates within the law, its responsibility is to its owners and no others - as an economic increase lifts living standards of wider society too, or as Reagan said, 'A rising tide lifts all boats'. This is, in my view, incredibly short-sighted, as obviously profit maximisation can happen at the expense of society! This can affect business profitability in the long run, though as I'm sure we're all aware, western businesses look at their profits in quarterly or yearly terms and aren't fussed with the long-term effects. I mean, think about a businesses' environmental impact. If they fuck the earth, eventually there won't be an earth for them to operate within and their profits will be nonexistent. Likewise, if a company underpays its workers and it employs a lot of people, eventually their families won't have enough money to pay for their products or services and they'll have to drop their prices (and profits) to maintain patronage - this is very simplified of course, but you get the picture.   Secondly, you have managerial view of CSR - that the company has a responsibility to stakeholders of the firm, while managers have the responsibility to 'fix' or 'prevent' problems that may arise. So, to continue from my example before, a company underpaying its workers would experience problems with staff morale or effort, which thereby affects the productivity and profitability of the company. Thus, profit maximisation has an effect on the firm's longer-term profitability  and management realises this , and would attempt to rectify it. From an environmental perspective, the firm's pollution might be viewed as a problem for management to set green targets on, thus being a fixable problem.   Third, you have a relational view of CSR, which is where the company is aware of its position as a member of wider society and its actions are inherently linked to societal effects. The firm still exists to maximise profits, but this is truncated by its knowledge of wider consequences and how far it can push things in any direction. There are many businesses that adhere to this, but they're often smaller than their big-box counterparts who maintain a very utilitarian (or sometimes managerial) view of their responsibilities. I believe that eventually companies will become more aware as things get worse by their hand - they're going to have to, just look at the wage campaigns and rights to organise pushed by McDonald's and Wal-Mart employees - but when this will happen is hard to say."
changemyview,"How about letting people work for a wage that would not allow them to have an acceptable standard of living?   Here's an alternative thought for you: why are corporations responsible for guaranteeing an individual's quality of life. Parallel-wise, why am I legally prevented from working for a wage below a certain threshold; why is the government allowed to tell me what kind of work is good for me, and why are they allowed to decide  for  me what kind of work is bad.   I agree with you that it sucks when people can't afford food and shelter. I'd even go so far as to say that I agree with you that it is a failure of society when we have a situation where some people can't afford food and shelter. But here's where I disagree: why is it all the sudden the responsibility of  corporations  when this happens.   To make an analogy:   > heavy traffic is very very bad. Heavy traffic can double your travel time. This causes undue environmental pollution in the form of millions of idling engines. Heavy traffic also increases the risk of accident, and last year there was [33,561]( traffic fatalities. And I'd say corporations are responsible for this. After all, they put their head offices way out in the suburbs where land is cheaper. This forces people to have to drive further for their jobs. There should be a law putting a limit on how far corporations can force you to commute, to solve this problem.   Everything I just said above is literally true. Heavy traffic has many negative effects. There are ridiculous amounts of traffic fatalities every year. Traffic fatalities scale with miles driven. For that matter: There are many places in the US where the communities are structured such that you  need  a car to get to work. It really,  really  sucks that minimum wage workers are forced into a situation where they need to spend 25-35% of their income on transportation, when it would be just as easy for jobs to be closer to them.   But here's the difference: for whatever reason, nobody sees this as corporations' faults. They see this as the government's fault. And so nobody thinks it's reasonable for corporations to try and solve this (and, in fact, when corporations actually try and be responsible for their impact on traffic congestion, [people get  ANGRY  about it](   And yet, all the sudden, when we're talking about low wage workers, the responsibility for helping them is not their community, it's not their social organizations (church/etc), it's not their local government, it's not their national government, it's their employers. This is crazy.   As far as I'm concerned, if someone is unable to afford food or shelter, this is a failure of  society , and it's  society 's responsibility to solve it. Wage controls are a shitty attempt by the government to force someone else to solve their problem.   Instead of forcing employers to pay above-market wages for low-value work, why not try and solve this problem more directly. Raise taxes, use the revenue to fund antipoverty programs. Minimum wage legislation is crude and poorly targeted.   Progressive taxation + antipoverty programs takes from the rich and gives to the poor. Minimum wage laws on the other hand? They take from corporate revenues and give to the employable poor. On the taking side: you're not taking from the rich. You're forcing businesses to increase their prices. Which hits their customers. Who are typically members of the middle class (you think millionaires shop at Walmart and eat at McDonalds? Hah!). On the giving side: you're not giving to all the poor. You're giving to the poor who are able to jump through the hoop of 'employability'. You're sure not helping homeless or unemployed people."
changemyview,"Here's something I've thought about regarding ads being barely noticeable: Ad blindness. Many people get so habituated to ads they ignore them, meaning that the advertiser is paying for a service they aren't going to get anything from. Maybe in the aggregate enough people will make a purchase based on an ad that it's worth it, but as an individual am I contributing "my fair share"? It gets to this weird position where you feel guilty for using ad block, so you turn it off and ignore the ads. Then you feel guilty for ignoring the ads, so you read them even though you have no real interest in them. Then what do you do, start purchasing things that are advertised to you that you don't need out of guilt? Otherwise aren't you extorting the advertising company into paying for your surfing habits, like going on a date with someone willing to buy you supper but knowing ahead of time you aren't really interested in them (beyond the free meal)?"
changemyview,"It's not just pedantry though -- there are meaningful world view implications of the mindset implied that people who load then ignore ads are "contributors" but people who block ads aren't. If you load an ad with no intention to buy the advertising company's products or to even  pay it any attention  (as is statistically likely  then aren't you in a way defrauding the company paying for the ad into paying for your browsing habits? Conversely, if you feel guilted into buying things through ads that you don't need so you aren't a moocher as I outlined, then you just as well be paying for the service you are using and leaving out the middle man (and the shipping of a product you don't really want other than to avoid guilt). If you load an ad and genuinely follow through (by purchasing something, not by clicking on it to go to another website whose ads you ignore), then I suppose you are balancing the local economy by sacrificing money, but it is only through sheer luck that you were interested in that product enough to purchase it but had not yet purchased it through another channel.   I'm not trying to be pedantic, the whole thing just seems like an irrational custom that I feel worth scrutinizing."
changemyview,"I have a lot of sympathy with your position. I, like many people, and I'm guessing you as well, feel that standardized testing is a waste when students could be learning far more useful skills and applying far more of their talents and abilities.   HOWEVER, the science on IQ testing is really well established: standardized tests correlate very well with IQ tests, and also with later educational achievement, and  also  with later success in careers, higher incomes in adult life, etc. Standardized tests are very predictive, almost scarily predictive.   There's an element to IQ testing known as  the g factor . Cognitive researchers hypothesize that it represents some general mental ability... perhaps something like mental "energy," perhaps a general ability to focus. They aren't really sure what it is.   But what they are sure of is that the g factor is [quite predictive](     the correlation between IQ and grades and achievement scores is between .60 and .70. At more advanced educational levels, more students from the lower end of the IQ distribution drop out, which restricts the range of IQs and results in lower validity coefficients. In high school, college, and graduate school the validity coefficients are .50鈥?60, .40鈥?50, and .30鈥?40, respectively     According to research by Robert L. Thorndike, 80 to 90 percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g, with the rest attributed to non-g factors measured by IQ and other tests.     Research suggests that the SAT, widely used in college admissions, is primarily a measure of g. A correlation of .82 has been found between g scores computed from an IQ test battery and SAT scores.     There is a high correlation of .90 to .95 between the prestige rankings of occupations, as rated by the general population, and the average general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation. At the level of individual employees, the association between job prestige and g is lower 鈥?one large U.S. study reported a correlation of .65 (.72 corrected for attenuation).     The correlation between income and g, as measured by IQ scores, averages about .40 across studies. The correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age, stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age. Even when education, occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant, the correlation does not vanish.     The g factor is reflected in many social outcomes. Many social behavior problems, such as dropping out of school, chronic welfare dependency, accident proneness, and crime, are negatively correlated with g independent of social class of origin.[68] Health and mortality outcomes are also linked to g, with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood."
LoLTwistedTreeline,"I'm glad you asked this   To respond to your first concern, it is alright to give up the first altar. I would however, atleast show presence or try to catch them in a good fight to contest. It's important to focus the Hard AD carry or AP carry first (preferable the AD carry if you get a chance). As long as you're able to re-capture that altar at a time that they are backed or it's 2v3 you should be fine.   Also, your laners need to realize that (if you are trying to collapse on their invade) it's okay to leave their lanes and the xp. It's more important to shut them down then to boost yourself up.   Lastly, if you can clear the first 2 camps efficiently then you will only lose like 1 camp from their invade if that. You shouldn't get shoved out too hard.

OperationGrabAss,"I wouldn't be a reader of this subreddit if I didn't hate TSA, but I don't think this is as simple for Obama as you all say. What do you think Republicans would do if Obama abolished TSA entirely tomorrow?   >Obama has stripped our airports bare of security and left the door wide open for terrorists!   No. Stop. Really, do you think they'd say  anything  else? Sure, there would initially be a few happy people, but then the Republicans would turn it around:   >Oh, we did want Obama to abolish TSA--but we didn't want our ports undefended. Obama should have encouraged private industry to step up and replace TSA with an American citizen-friendly method of security. Instead, Obama decided to jettison those jobs...   So it's not so black and white as "oh, Obama could just stop this with a wave of his hand." No, he really couldn't. There are many different opinions, some dissenting, on what should be done to fix the problem with TSA. My personal opinion is that the current system should be evaluated by consultants from the Israeli airline El Al, which TSA was supposedly based upon, and have them correct the flawed implementation. I have flown El Al, and you'd think the Israelis would be militant about security like us... but they aren't. It was fast, painless, and not at all invasive.

The free trip was cool, the propaganda was lulzy, and damn, it was great to not get felt up at the airport...   Anyway,"

He is kind of a screw up sometimes so maybe he messed up the process. He ended up having to get it from Steam."
swrpg,"I've got a thought for you as the player. :)   Regarding your situation, or, how to roleplay a morally questionable character from a player's perspective: it depends.  Remember that this is a game and everyone is trying to have fun.  It is your duty as a player to contribute to that fun - don't get caught up in the "My character would do this so I have to/should do it even though it's a jerk move."  I've got a personal story to illustrate my point.   Many moons ago, one of my best friends (still, in case it sounds like after this incident he wasn't!) and I were in a D&D game in college.  He was playing an elven rogue named Pendel.  Pendel was a bad, bad guy at heart and my buddy was super committed to playing him out that way.  The party gradually began to see this and watched him degenerate over the course of time from bad to worse in his behavior and how he treated his companions.  This started to bleed out a big among the players and my buddy resolved to "find a solution" while remaining true to his character.   Finally, during a particularly difficult journey chasing an extremely threatening and capable vampire, the party woke up one morning to find most of their stuff gone, their pack animals and riding animals killed, and a a trail of tracks going cold just off site.  Pendel and the GM slowly begin to introduce my buddy's new character and the party goes on with a shrug saying, "Guy took our stuff and disappeared!  Jerk, but not much we can do at this point.  We'll track him down later."  We all assumed that my buddy and the Gm had worked out a quick and appropriate exit for the unloved Pendel and moved on.   Secretly, though, Pendel's player and the GM had worked out something far more interesting behind closed doors.  That real story was that Pendel had made a deal with the king vampire and left us to become a thrall of his.  It worked and, much later down the road, the party met up with Pendel again.  This time he was full on evil vampire.  Everyone at the table really, really  hated  this character.   I'm talking vicious,  soul wrenching hatred . A massive fight ensued where the party's favorite character since the beginning - a happy-go-lucky fighter named Aldo who served as part brave warrior and part comic relief - was killed.  By Pendel. And not just killed.  Guy was mutilated and left on some sort of sacrificial altar for the party to find.  Now the party swore vengeance against Pendel and he became the BBEG for the remainder of that two year long campaign.   Was it a satisfying narrative?  You betchya.  Absolutely.  But it wasn't easy at first and there were some hurt feelings among players until we got "over the hill" and saw Pendel as a sworn enemy.  I've seen groups break up over far less - I've been a part of groups who broke up over far less.  It takes a certain level of player maturity.   All in all, my recommendation is not to blur that line between "What my character would do and what I would do." This is a game played for fun, not for social study.  Don't stress it and make sure you're contributing positively to everyone's fun and not just stroking your own ego for religiously playing a character who's "true to himself.""
Metallica,"Wait, is anyone actually disagreeing that  AJFA  is the fucking bomb? It's a refinement of six years of work and development as a band, and the undeniable pinnacle of songwriting achievement for Metallica. IMO it's their best album, and it's my favorite Metallica album, above even  Ride the Lightning  and  Master of Puppets . It contains some of my favorite songs ("Dyers Eve," "Harvester of Sorrow," "Blackened," "Eye of the Beholder,") not just from Metallica, but in general, the entire world over. "Dyers Eve" holds particular significance for me, being not just my favorite Metallica song but one of my favorite songs ever--and a lot of that, frankly, came with my own emotional difficulties and certain resentments I held towards my own parents that came about when I really started to listen to and love Metallica (which have long since been resolved, but I digress.)   The fact that they were able to create songs with such powerful emotional resonance, combined with a technicality and progressiveness that's not just impressive for the sheer skill of the band but also for the remarkable taste and astounding melodicism with which they pull it all off, should be a testament to the quality of that material. Of extremely important note is the fact that they recorded it all with Jason Newsted, a new bassist they were still getting used to playing with, and in the wake of the tragedy arising from the passing of Cliff. The fact that in spite of such a loss (and, at the same time, such a gain--remember that, while he was no Cliff Burton, Jason was no slouch when it came to conjuring up magic on his bass, even if you can barely hear it in the mix) they were able to put together such an amazing album is, frankly, remarkable.   With all of the hate that gets tossed at Metallica from the metal community at large, it's often easy for people to forget that, for a long time, they really were the greatest metal band in the world. A single listen to any of the cuts off of  ...And Justice For All  makes it completely obvious why that was. And while it's true that I'd rather listen to The Chasm or Bolt Thrower than Metallica's post-Black Album output (although I do love all of their stuff,  Lulu  excepted,) if I had to live on a desert island and could only take one metal album with me, ten times out of ten it would have to be  ...And Justice For All.  At the time (this was 1988!) nobody else was really doing this kind of thing--combining this sort of extreme heaviness with all of the progressiveness, technicality and melody that they conjured up for  AJFA . Remember that, in 1988, this was still groundbreaking stuff--Dream Theater wouldn't release an LP for another half-year (and when  When Dream and Day Unite  finally did come out, it  still  wasn't as good as this,) the rest of the progressive metal world was still busy trying to be Yes or Rush (not to knock prog metal though, because I love that shit, same goes for Yes and Rush) and the only things that could really come close at the time were Death's  Leprosy  and Slayer's  South of Heaven  (both released the same year and both, IMO, of near-equal quality.) While Megadeth was still doing Sex Pistols covers and Anthrax was quickly fading into outdatedness and irrelevance, Metallica was crafting an eternal masterpiece."
berkeley,"First off, thank you Snaphooked for all you've done for us. I don't think there's anything we can do or say to fully express our gratitude for what all you and your military brethren have done and sacrificed for us.   Anyway, to try and answer your question, you can try contacting [TRSP]( I know they have helped many veterans with their transfer plans, and have also helped in veterans transition into Berkeley/college life. Also, they can help you get into contact with other veterans who may volunteer to mentor you through the process. So I suggest contacting them first.   As a transfer student, I've met many in CC and at Cal who've done the CC to UC transfer route (as many have already stated). I don't know of any who've gone straight to a UC after their service, but I'm sure it's possible. I recommend going to any CA CC and transfer. Sure, it'll take a good 2 years to do so, but you save so much in costs, not just in tuition, but also for living arrangements. Additionally, if you're not originally a CA resident, attending a CA CC will give you time to establish residency (this will reduce tuition costs significantly, just in case the GI Bill doesn't cover 100%).   Additionally, some CCs have transfer agreements with Cal (mostly in Northern CA). Basically, you're "accepted", but just have to fulfill your necessary requirements (ie. core courses, GPA, etc). Note, that not  all  CCs have this program. Different CCs have agreements with different UCs. But just because the CC of your choice doesn't have a transfer agreement program with Cal, doesn't mean you can't apply to or attend Cal. My CC didn't and I had no problem.   One word of caution, Berkeley has different requirements than all the other UCs. So just because you fulfill your requirements for all the other UCs does not mean you fulfilled the requirements for Berkeley (I learned this the hard way).   Sorry for the wall-o-text. If there's anything else you'd like to know, feel free to PM me. And best of luck to you :D"
berkeley,"If you really don't enjoy Econ, then I think you should definitely take time to explore other majors. And if you're having a hard time exploring at Cal, then going to CC for some time is not a bad idea at all.   I just graduated with an Econ degree. However, I don't give two shits about Econ or 99% of the stuff that I learned while taking those classes. I felt out of place and unmotivated during my studies, so I got nothing out of Econ. I got stuck with it because I didn't know what else to do and the few times I tried exploring, I ended up finding things that I didn't enjoy. My degree only helps a bit with job searching because Econ stands out for a lot of businesses I guess, but they're all jobs that I really don't give much of a damn for and don't see myself actually being happy with. I really wish I took time to explore more, whether it was at Cal or at a CC because there's so much here that probably would've been more interesting to me.   What you study may or may not determine your career after you graduate. If you just want to go into business, you don't really need a particular major as long as you have some relevant internships/work experience under your belt when you apply, so you should study something you enjoy. If you want to go into academia or a STEM field, you're more likely to need to pick specific majors. That said though, you should pick a career-relevant major that you enjoy. Otherwise, you might feel like your just slaving away.   Also, you should find something that interests you for your own personal development. You're surrounded by bright people and have access to excellent resources here, so there's a lot to learn. You won't learn if you hate it and find no motivation to seek more knowledge. You should graduate college a brighter person with a better understanding of the world. You can achieve that by studying something you actually enjoy."
berkeley,"It's basically about this person who is hired by a mega-corporation to infiltrate an anarcho-environmentalist/Green anarchist organisation known as The East. As she went more into the organisation she started to realise the positions of The East also makes sense, probably even more than the corporation she's working for. It's an interesting look into so-called eco-terrorists and the points they're making, and it also ties in with the theme of the recent NSA exposure scandal."
MLBTheShow,"Early in the count watch for a fastball up. Don't swing at breaking balls unless left up.  0-2, look fastball up but react to everything in the zone or close, contact swings are good. If it's a borderline pitch, wait for it to get deep, and foul it off.  2-0, 2-1, 3-1, look for high fastball again. But take everything you don't like. CPU always seems to use a high FB in these counts.  If you use the prediction system that I use, if you call the pitch and zone right, it pops up as the pitcher is winding up. At that point, I aim to lift it to my pull side. HR 70% of the time. And my RTTS guy has <60 power. The more pitches, the better a chance that they leave something up.  I'm assuming you have a good eye and timing. Both of those will come if you're new."

videos,"I have been reading the book Rendezvous with Rama, so I have been puzzling over this a bit recently. This is how I have come to understand it:   Centrifugal force describes the repulsion as a force that acts on spinning things pushing them away.   Centripetal force describes the opposite force, the force pushing against a moving object forcing it to travel in a curved path.   Imagine you were spinning inside a gravitron carnival ride. If the carnival ride abruptly stopped existing, you would fly off in a strait line.   Because moving in a curve is less efficient than moving in a line, you must constantly accelerate to maintain the same speed. This acceleration is what simulates gravity.   Imagine you were inside a spinning cylinder that was filled with a vacuum. You could lazily float all day and the cylinder could spin as fast as it wanted, but it would not push you at all. No centrifugal force.   However, if the spinning cylinder had an atmosphere, the gas will (very slowly?) communicate some of the motion of the cylinder to you, so eventually you will start moving.   Once you start moving, physics wants you to move in a strait line. However, there is only so far a strait line can go inside a circle. Eventually you will "fall" to the edge of the cylinder. But, that is just you going in a strait line.   Centripetal force occurs when you reach the interior surface of the cylinder. When you walk on the surface of the cylinder, centripetal force is the force of the cylinder pushing up at you preventing you from escaping."
videos,"I read your post and I don't understand how I have it backwards. I think you said it more clearly, but we are saying the same thing.   "The wall of the ride is PUSHING YOU AWAY from your straight line path"   is pretty much saying what I was trying to say with   "Centripetal force describes the opposite force, the force pushing against a moving object forcing it to travel in a curved path."   The other point I made about the atmosphere in the cylinder kind of a separate issue, but I think I am correct about that too. Look at it this way:   Imagine you are in a big rotating cylinder that had an atmosphere. Like, a really big one (like the space station from the book Rendezvous with Rama.)   If you took a rocket car and drove fast enough to cancel the cylinders rotation, say 35 mph, you would be completely still.   However, it would not seem that way. You would need to keep your foot on the gas because friction from the atmosphere would keep slowing you down.   If you then jumped, that same atmosphere would push you back. Maybe the wind would be strong enough to push you back down, maybe not, but it  would  be pushing you at least a little.   Its possible you might be able to float for a while right in the center, but with random turbulence i doubt it would be stable."
videos,"As someone whose parents have been dealing with an insurance claim gone bad (more damage was done from the contractors taking our items then the actual claim) the way Judge Judy was rude and condescending to this recent vet was uncalled for. He barely got to present his side without being interrupted and was constantly insulted. Although in the end he said he was going to take the defendant to court (which is why that smiling a-hole most likely threw the stuff out on the curb) he probably thought his items would be released to him after some sort of settlement.   He also shouldn't have to pay for the next month's rent when a hurricane flooded the apartment, the only reason he took his stuff out of there was so it wouldn't get more damage. The defendant is a total slumlord. 90% of the time it bothers me when "vet" is in the headline for some injustice but the rudeness here really struck a chord with me and I felt it was worth mentioning."

videos,"Hi, you don't understand cultural relativism at all. Cultural relativism isn't just the system that claims you can't judge people in a cultural value, because that is self-contradictory. Is that a universal value that you can't judge other cultures or just a cultural one? Both would contradict the statement.   That's because cultural relativism is a method of anthropology/science. Which is the method of reporting things should not be viewed as through a cultural lesson. While you want to claim some sort of moral relativism. But you don't even explain what is relative!   Descriptively you can say two different people disagree. So? What epistemic value does that hold? That doesn't  prove  anything. If the ancient Greeks held that the Earth is the center of the universe, we don't start claiming that their value is culturally relevant. The mere disagreement is not evidence of different objective values.   Even then you make huge leap of logic, even if it was the case that nobody is objectively right or wrong (what is called meta-ethical relativism), you still have to prove your normative claim that I have to tolerate it. Just because morality is not-objective, on what grounds do I have to tolerate it? Just because the grounds for ethics is non-algorithmic doesn't mean that all values are equally valid. Another claim."
videos,"Only on reddit can someone find justification of child molestation.   First of all, it's ridiculous to claim that kids do not have any ability to consent at all. Children, past the infant stage, are certainly partially autonomous. Consent requires understanding, and a child definitely has a limited form of understanding. Which means that a kid can consent or deny consent meaningfully to small range of subjects. This could include playing in the back yard, eating a particular food, watching a particular show, and other decisions kids make. In other words, they can consent to small range of activities.   However, when any individual does not understand the situation, then no meaningful consent can be given. Furthermore, a anyone who is forced to be put in a situation which he or she does not understand is having their autonomy infringed upon. This could be justified in most medical situation, but it is never appropriate in the case of sexual acts."

videos,"To simply say that The Massive Monkees were better dancers is a bit of an overstatement. Hitting the moves on the beat is the basics of not only breakdancing, but all dancing. You can't say that what Jinjo Crew did was nothing but a bunch of stunts while claiming that The Massive Monkees did was the are of dance. The Massive Monkees didn't just beat some group of guys that were good at stunts, they beat THE Jinjo Crew. If you knew anything about the B-boy scene, you would know who they are. Both crews put on an amazing performance, which we should be thankful for seeing. To say otherwise would be an insult to the blood and sweat poured into this performance by both crews.   If you want to look at how the judges scored, Jinjo Crew beat the Massive Monkees on execution and lost on foundation and originality. Individually, I would have to say that Jinjo Crew had better dancers. Their moves were quicker, cleaner, and, on average, more complicated. However, The Massive Monkees did an amazing job showing off their flow of creativity and their teamwork. That is why the judges gave them the win.   It gets easy for things to get biased when we put thing in terms of "USA vs Korea" or Country X vs Country Y. When our team loses, it's because of biased judging and the other team cheated. Look at how the US media started attacking the Chinese during the Olympics for the "abusive" training the athletes went through when China started presenting itself as a threat to US dominance at the Olympics. But note how the dancers are as soon as the battle is done, before the results are announced. They're excited for each other and freaking hugging each other and shit. We have to remember, or at least try to remember, that's what this is about. Bringing the world together by sharing in what we love to do."

The anti-fight mentality is only for safety and doesn't make us pansy-asses. Not everyone has the same restraint that you might have. That other someone might just kill a man while seeing red without careful discretion of why. Nipping this behavior in the bud stops what could be an unnecessary issue (like death, or something, maybe. I dunno). I do commend your reasoning about getting someone to see the error of their ways, but your methods might not work out in your best interest one day.   However, if you were protecting yourself from a physical assault, then you gotta do what you have to. Yet if some jackass is spitting shit, why bother? They probably wont change just because they got floored. Most assholes that like nothing more than to talk will just be pissed off that they got floored, but will never think as to WHY it happened. This isn't the wild west frontier anymore, and walking away from this situation would've best way to handle it.   If people truly understood their own mortality, this ridiculous aggression wouldn't happen on either end. I hope you didn't take any offense to this, as none was intended.

This guy had physical proof that he had insurance, so imo the cop was being a dick   From wiki:   >The insurance certificate or cover note issued by the insurance company constitutes legal evidence that the vehicle specified on the document is insured. The law says that an authorised person, such as the police, may require a driver to produce an insurance certificate for inspection. If the driver cannot show the document immediately on request, and proof of insurance cannot be found by other means such as the Police National Computer, drivers are no longer issued a HORT/1. This was an order with seven days, as of midnight of the date of issue, to take a valid insurance certificate (and usually other driving documents as well) to a police station of the driver's choice. Failure to produce an insurance certificate is an offence. The HORT/1 was commonly known 鈥?even by the issuing authorities when dealing with the public 鈥?as a "Producer"."
videos,"Before we jump to conclusions, look at this effort before and after the short video. A couple months back, this kid probably asked for a roller coaster. Dad, tired of crazy requests and needing to get outside and not deal with his wife's next project inside the house, makes a run to Home Depot to get some 4x4 posts, PVC, bolts, and cement. He goes into his backyard, with a post digger and tears up the back yard, pouring cement for the posts. He then painstakingly builds the tracks with pipe, boards, etc following some grand plan he's put on some graph paper. He spends every weekend for a couple months doing this ignoring other family outings to get this done. Finally, he builds this car, tests it with a bag of cement, maybe the family dog, and finally has something his kid won't die in. He has grand plans for a chain and lawnmower engine to bring his kid up, but for now he'll do it himself. The child goes on it a half dozen times, then goes inside to play video games. He goes on it after school everyday for a week, maybe invites some friends over the next week, always having to bother dad to push him up the hill. Dad is thrilled that his kid is so happy, but is getting tired of having to push him each time. After the first week or two though, he stops asking to go on the roller coaster. The weather is warming up and the grass is now growing around the posts and low parts where it can't be hit by the lawnmower. The kid is no longer interested and wants to play soccer instead, but now there's a huge roller coaster in the backyard with posts permanently in place. The wife, at first thrilled that the kid is having so much fun with dad is now resentful of the monstrosity in the backyard and keeps asking when dad will take it down, mow the lawn, etc.  Eventually, the whole family is angry at Dad when he's the one who did all the work."

videos,"Awesome, I love hearing people getting into running. What I always tell new runners (or people getting back into it) is that you shouldn't underestimate your abilities. Sometimes those C25K programs will have you running absurdly low distances to start out. Try setting out a distance you wanna run for each week, say, 2 miles. Maybe the first day you run 1 mile (and by the way, Runners World considers anything under 15 min/mile to be a brisk pace so don't get down on yourself). Maybe the 2nd day you add on 400m, and so on and so on.  And take days off when you feel really sore. My coach always says recovery days can be just as important as workout days. The goal is to run until you're tight (unless of course you hurt something or have difficulty breathing).  In my experience, you can tell when you've gone as far as you can, farther than just "Oh I'm tired" or "Oh my feet hurt" when your body begins to tighten up, at that point, stop and call it a day.   Another thing, don't tell yourself "It's ok, I'll stop for 2 minutes and then keep going". While this probably doesn't make any physical hindrance to your work out, it puts you in a bad mindset that says its ok to quit, I see this in the high school level too.   Also, I highly suggest trying to run outside instead of a "dreadmill". You'll find running infinitely more enjoyable if you can actually physically see the distance you have traveled.   And try to change up where you run, or at least the course. A new scenery can be key to hitting the goal distances I mentioned earlier.   One more thing, and this is a big one. Run naked every now and then. I don't literally mean no clothes. I mean no watches, no iPod, no HR monitor. You'll find running much more natural if you do away with this stuff.   Oh, and don't carry a water bottle with you. I assume you're not running any more than 5k right now but drinking water mid run on anything less than a half will only cause more harm than good.   Also, I don't care how big you may be, rep the short shorts when you run. They are so much easier to run in than basketball shorts and are amazing.   That was really long but I had nothing else to do so there you have it."
videos,"I met Bobby Lee once. I had been watching a friend at M.I. Westside Comedy Theater in Santa Monica. It was an amateur night so I had been drinking a lot of beer to compensate. After the amateurs they switch over to pros but I didn't have the money to stick around; i spent it all on beer. When the amateur show was over, I meandered to the bathroom went in and pissed. Then as I walk out, there's Bobby Lee standing in front of me. I get so excited because I had just seen something he was in (i can't for the life of me remember what). I wanted to shake his hand but since I dont usually use paper towels, mine was still wet from washing my hands. I was worried he would think i had piss hands. Anyway, I told him that he was great in that special where he was naked and that I was pretty glad I didn't poop before he had to use the bathroom. Or at least, that's how I remember it happening."
videos,"It was long thought as true -the idea that more salt=higher BP- and it persists today as 'common knowledge.' However more and more research is showing that it's not so bad, and is possibly not relevant at all.*   It is worth noting that new research often doesn't immediately reach your normal doctor, so even now people will cite their doctor as a source saying salt is bad (or any number of other things). This is understandable; it certainly was thought true when the doc was in med school, and they've only heard the same common knowledge type repetition since. Doctors do try to stay abreast of new research, but there is just to much (and often not enough time); I've even noted my young, tech-savvy doc being wrong based on old info a few times."

Check out  this  image are indicated with vertical arrows. Notice that in this picture, the "object" is bigger than the "image"鈥攂ut let's flip the labels so that the image is the arrow on the left and the object is the one on the right. (The ray diagram is still perfectly valid, regardless of which way the rays go.) This ordering represents what we want, since for these sorts of macro shots, we want the image the iPhone sees to be quite a bit larger than the actual object.   And of course, the iPhone has its own lens, which is focused "at infinity"鈥攖hat is, it takes pictures using incoming rays that are basically collimated (all traveling horizontally, as in the left-hand sides of your pictures). We don't need the laser pointer lens to focus light onto the iPhone's camera; that's what the iPhone's lens is for."
videos,"Not that it wasn't enjoyable in ways, but it was  very  weak sci-fi. None of the explanations made any sense. Several of the more important explanations are entirely undermined by some basic facts about water: 1. It's an abundant substance in the universe. 2. It's particularly abundant in moons of Jupiter and Saturn (including, you know, Titan) 3. It's difficult to derive energy from.   I'm happy to forgive a handful of missing explanations, but nothing in Oblivion makes sense under a moment's thought."

videos,"Typically when you see trucks roll over it's because of a massive cross wind hitting the trailer because there is more surface area and air can easily get under the trailer. Your average truck has a low center of mass and air can't get under it easily. I don't think the truck is more likely to roll with a trailer because trailer are already extremely susceptible to rollover so it will go first. But obviously a lighter truck wouldn't be able to keep it down like a heavier one. So if the trailer does roll the lighter truck is more likely to go with.   BUT!   When you are bobtail its a different story. Just the truck by itself would be more susceptible to rollover than a heavier one. Same surface area and less weight."

videos,"The one and only time I have decided to help someone during this scam was on Easter Sunday last year. I pulled into a gas station to buy a coffee quick and a man approached me asking for some money to get from Point A to Point B. He said he was on his way to see his kids for Easter but forgot his wallet at home and of course needed gas to get there. I was in a good mood and decided I'd help the guy out. I told him.. "Let me go buy my coffee and I'll help you when I come back out." When buying my coffee, I told the clerk to put $10 on whatever pump he was on. I came back out and told the guy and he instantly became confused. He kept stating he thought I was going to give him cash. I told him I made it even easier for him, all he needed to do was pump the fuel and leave. He then pumped the gas and left, seemingly disappointed."
videos,"I had an experience that may not be exactly like this, but what it does have in common is that awful feeling of betrayal and rage.   As a teenager I did a lot of power washing jobs in my hometown and it paid really well. Before starting a full-day job, I stopped at a gas station to fill up and two guys quickly pulled into to the pump next to me. As I'm waiting to fill up, they approach me and say they are "Home Theater installers"...You can probably guess where this is going... Anyway, they said they had just finished an installation in the neighborhood but they still had excess inventory in their truck that their "boss" never accounted for. They showed me an "inventory slip", they showed me a "business card", and they showed me a pamphlet from the speaker company. The MSRP on the speaker box read something around $3,000. I've always been interested in electronics and sounds systems and also did a lot of ebay sales on the side so I naively saw this as an awesome investment. I ended up paying the men $500 for the speakers and then one of the guys gave me a "phone number" saying to call if I had any questions. Feeling like I'm about to be rich, I went to my power washing job and worked all day. But as the hours passed, my conscience grew heavier and heavier. I finished the job and made a solid $250. But I still couldn't shake my skepticism about what I had purchased. I went to the nearest best buy to see if the speakers had any merit鈥攏ope. I searched the internet and finally found that the speakers were worth about $75 NEW. I was beyond livid. I called the guy and left a million angry messages but that was clearly pointless. At the end of full day of honest work, I'm still out $250. I still think about that experience all the time and it makes my blood boil. It was 7 years ago and still, every time I'm in my hometown I always linger through that same gas station hoping to catch those guys or scammers just like them."
videos,"Okay, this is gonna be a long one and fairly complicated to write out but here it goes. The band I use to sing for was on tour and our van broke down somewhere in Washington. It was 3 AM and there were absolutely no garages open at that time. I tried sleeping for a while but anyone who has been in a van filled with 5 un-showered guys, knows that isn't easy to do. I decided to go for a little walk since the little town we broke down in wasn't very threatening and I felt I wouldn't get mugged or killed.   Cut to 10 minutes into my walk as I am heading down the road and notice a guy following me. He keeps getting closer to the point were I notice two things before he speaks to me. One, this guy is drunk as fuck, and two, he is Native American. Not that the last thing mattered but hey, I did say I noticed two things. So, I turn around and he is like, "Heyyyy mannn, wat rrrr you dewin?". I start to tell him I am just out for a walk, and he drunkenly cuts me off and is like "hey, doo you got any changsh". I'm like "no, I don't have any money on me." (truth by the way). He's like, "hey mannn, I like youuu...do you got any shmokes?". I said, "No, I don't smoke". Then he goes...again, "hey, do you have any change?". I'm thinking what the hell, he already asked me this. So I say no AGAIN and he seriously starts asking me the same stuff over and over. It's like I am on the receiving end of a bad joke by someone who has short term memory loss.   So this conversation literally goes on for 5 minutes, interlaced with him also asking me if I wanted to fight him and when I reply "no", he like "oh man, I like you, your my friend"..followed by asking me if I have change. Finally I am like "listen man, the only money I have is invisible money" to which he surprisingly replied "well, can I have some of THAT?" in a tone that insinuated that I was just being difficult and could have solved the whole problem by just giving him that in the first place. So I reach in my pocket, pull my hand out, hover it over his open palm and drop nothing but air into his hand. He seriously stood there looking at his hand for 2 minutes before once again asking me if I want to fight. I said no again and that is when I saw a 24 hour gas station. I was like "hey buddy (cause he and I are friends, or so I have been told 20 times), I bet someone at that gas station not only has money, but cigarettes too.". Dude was like "oh thanks man, cya later". I made a rush back towards the tour van thinking to my self, oh god I hope not."

videos,"Another Indian here... so, the key piece of this you have to be aware of is that the police don't exist to protect the lay person in most of India. They are underfunded and under-resourced. Typically it is mob-rule. So, if I am person on the street confronted by "well connected" folks, I am going to just take the abuse....and hope that they go away without harming me too badly. IF, I do face a situation where I have to fight back...then I am going to go get my own group, family, relatives, fellow religious followers, and deal with it as a group...preferably. In most smaller town and cities everyone knows each other. They know who has clout, and who doesn't.   Also, you never mess with a police officer or the family of a police officer. The police basically have license to "arrest" (i.e. torture and brutally abuse) anyone that crosses them. And if your a ranking officer? Nobody touches you. It is a highly "respected" position. AKA fuck off.   That's my take on it anyway. If they had the resources to adequately fund their police and legal system it might be a different story."
videos,"This is racing, and Id put money on it that many of the commenters here don't know it's little quirks and are pretty much hearsay. What happened here was Tony "closed the door" on #13 to seal an overtake. This left #13 with nowhere to go and he left the track and spun out. Doing that is a capital offense in NASCAR affiliated events and usually ends in a fight between drivers; this is no surprise and is pretty much expected.  So, the track goes under caution. All the drivers must lower speed to about 30-40 mph, stay close to the inside, and stay inline to keep all positions constant; pretty much a pause button for a race.   13 left his car to pick a fight with Stewart, no surprise. What was a surprise was that Stewart broke formation, and given that the driver who was subsequently killed had a bone to pick with Stewart, to scare #13 and possibly accidentally hit him.   To all the laureate redditors here: there is no  Darwin Award , its what happened as a result of a common practice in this sport"
videos,"I fail to see this video as any definitive proof that Tony Stewart was clearly at fault like I've already seen some people suggest in articles and on Youtube.   In fact, I'm at least somewhat sure Tony Stewart did his best to avoid Ward given the footage.   Sprint cars race on dirt tracks with little traction. In fact, the entire process of turning involves hitting the accelerator to drift the back to push the correct course through the car's center around the track.   On the opposite side of the spectrum, if you brake, there is substantial skidding that happens which throws the car towards the outside of the turn.   Also note that Kevin Ward likely chose a path approaching, and around the 45 car that likely caused Ward to only become visible to Stewart at the very last second when the 45 car passed. In fact, the time between Ward being to the side of the 45 car and potentially in Stewart's field of view and the time that Stewart hits is less than 2 seconds.   Also, if you notice from the video, Stewart's car is in a slightly wider path around the turn and is in an out-to-in wobble  before  striking Ward.   What it looks like happened to me is Stewart saw Ward around the 45 car with almost no room, freaked out, slammed the brake, realized he was going to skid towards the outside where Ward was standing & cranked the wheel which gave the sprint car the out-to-in skid. Then the tire striking Ward caused the car to skid in-to-out which caused the rest of the wobble.   With just a couple frames of Stewart's car in the video before the accident, I'd hardly call this definitive, but the movement of the car right before the hit suggests he was trying to avoid Ward.   Also, I've noticed people say "you can hear Stewart gun it" on the video.  I'd like to point out that this accident occurred across the track from where the video was taken. What you are hearing is sprint cars pass on the near side. It's almost impossible to hear engine noise from the far side of the track.   I feel like I may be fighting imaginary or impossible foes as most of this is in response to youtube comments... which is never a good thing to argue, but I thought the above needed to be said.   Kevin Ward should never have run out on an active track... it doesn't matter if a caution is out. Driving footage from more angles should be looked at to make sure Tony Stewart had no intent, but knowing how racecar drivers are, I don't think they'd ever want to risk a dent to their machine under any circumstance. Because of all of this, I sincerely doubt that Tony Stewart had ill intent... At least with respect to using his car.   Edit  - Also saw a recent post that suggested Tony may have tried to "cut it too close" on purpose, which could be the case & the slide reaction could be in response to Ward coming in closer than Stewart thought. I don't necessarily think it's true that Stewart definitely saw him the whole way around the track though.   In fact, Ward is wearing black, the incident happened at the end of turn 2, Stewart's back would be facing Ward until nearly the end of turn 4, at which point, because this is a larger 1/2 mile track, Stewart is somewhere between 1/6th of a mile and 1/4th of a mile away (~1000 feet) so not the best for visibility of a dude wearing black on a poorly lit black mud track... even if he is flailing his arms.   Plus, entering turn 1, your viewing angle of the stalled car gets worse and worse (almost 90 degrees) until you pop your front around near where the incident happened. Heck, here's [on-board footage of Michael Thompson in a night race on a similar-sized track]( sure you'd be going slower, but it's already tough to make out details during the brief instances where you can see most of the way across the track.   Add to the fact that mud is constantly kicked up to the point that drivers need tear-away plastic visors just to maintain visibility, and Stewart seeing Ward before 2 seconds prior is anything but a certainty.   Edit 2  - Wow my inbox this morning O_o.   Thank you to the 2 kind strangers that guilded this post.   To add some important facts that were brought up in response to this post, while sprint cars are way more stable at low speed, there are  huge  gashes that get cut in the mud around the track during races and cars are still not entirely stable. To add to that, sudden braking or turning even at low speed  will  cause the vehicle to slide some, which I still feel is the most likely candidate for what caused the beginning wobble. Accelerating to drift the back around is also how you turn so as was pointed out so that could also explain a gut reaction by to turn away by Stewart that happened with too little time.   Also as was pointed out, yes you  can  hear engine noise during caution from across the track... it is outrageously faint when the car is facing away on the far side, and is easily masked by any other car on the near-side of the track. Also, If there is  one  car on the track, yes, you can tell exactly where it is and how fast it's going blindfolded. With the noise of additional cars passing very nearby below the stands, it becomes very difficult to hear the comparatively-faint noise of cars on the far side.   Another thing I didn't think about until this morning is that sounds takes time to travel. The video camera is easily 700 feet away and potentially even more (hard to tell because of zooming) meaning sound would likely take  a full second to get to the camera recording.   The fact that the rev "lines up perfectly" and it sounds as close as it does means it's probably an unfortunate coincidence that a racer passing the stands on the near side revved at the perfect time to play sound effects guy for the accident on the far side.   I know tempers are high in the aftermath and it's a very sensitive subject. I understand the emotion and deeply sympathize with Ward's family, friends and fans. I think video from the track should be investigated and Stewart further questioned, but the jump from the 7 available frames in the video of the accident to "Stewart = murderer" is a very crazy stretch.   The events of last night were tragic, please don't get caught in the mob-mentality of what is going on.   As for my credentials - I'm just a casual sprint fan who really likes physics and who has enjoyed a few nights at the Knoxville Raceway in IA. I never intended to be a definitive authority on the matter, nor did I ever intend for my post to be definitive proof for or against Stewart's guilt. My only intent was to show that the video in question may point to a different conclusion than a lot of people are jumping to and it's anything but absolute proof."
videos,"Saying the guy was offended by the hissy fit implies he even noticed. You are looking at it from the perspective of an outside observer, the driver is more worried about his car and the race than anything else. There was no collision between the cars so its likely the first notice he even got of the wreck was the caution sign, and as he passed the wreck it was likely he was looking at the car and not thinking someone would be dumb enough to come from behind the wrecked car and run directly towards him. It looks like the driver swerved towards him, but that is because the right tires lost traction on impact which jerked the car the right, he was driving normally and was in no way being unsafe when he hit the guy running directly at his car like a moron."

videos,"Don't misrepresent this OP: they weren't "getting a pass" for stealing with kids. The guy said nothing before the tapout tool chased them down to physically assault them. Before that, he and the male in the orange shirt were just preserving their assets, when the woman assaulted him. The other male, who I also figured was an employee or something, was following them, probably to report them to police or make sure they don't come back. I'm not saying it wasn't understandable that he got pissed, but he ran at least twenty feet to assault a group that contained young children."
videos,"When I worked at BG theme park some lady came up to the stand with her 4 kids. She claimed to have bought 6 hot dog baskets and left them on the table for a minute when someone took them.     We had only been open for 45 minutes.   I did not recognize the lady (or her kids) and I was the only one dealing directly with the guests. We hadn't even serviced more than 10 orders. I would remember her and that large order.   I sold a total of 4 hot dog baskets thus far, individually.   She didn't have a receipt.     I told her option 4 meant she can't get a refund or replacement and she started going ballistic until the person in the back came up front to talk with her.   This was the day the Head of Culinary was making some rounds and had been in the back trying to help.   Well, he definitely didn't make 6 hot dog baskets for one order and told her to kindly take her lies elsewhere.   To this day I am disgusted she tried to blatantly steal like this in front of her children."
videos,"No real damaging failures here.   I've destroyed my fair sum of capacitors (and been shocked for it) and the most all I see is the top balloon out. Search youtube for capacitor explosions and you'll see most just balloon or vent off a vapor (having something explode is a bad fail-safe). Probably just a little bit of special effects. Maybe the cord was sliced off at the end (not the end on screen) and was attached to a battery so it wasn't plugged into the wall.   Also, notice when he "touches" the A/C wires. Look at the voltmeter, it never jumped up even a single volt when he shocked himself (he claims a high voltage is running). He also pushes it off screen really fast to avoid us seeing that.   This video will certainly be one you'll remember when dealing with capacitors and bare wires."

I MAY BE ONE OF THE FEW HERE BUT THANK GOD FOR THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. arresting officers were the ones who talked with the other person first, it was pretty fair so they actually heard my case and we both ended up going to jail. i hear her balling uncontrollably in the cell next to mine. charges were expunged against me and she was tried by the state. it was scary as fuck, i had no video only an account of the events and luckily a witness saw her break in at a time after making the 911 call"

I was thrown off by:   > For the moment, we鈥檙e going to completely discard that assumption and make a different one: men and women commit the same amount of crime.   And I missed the ["Wrong" link]( That talks about sentencing, and incarceration, not likelihood of conviction, right? The author jumps to conviction rate from incarceration rate. That's not exactly the same thing.   Also, I'm not sure where this 165% comes from since I can't see the article NCFM used for this.   Regarding the study linked to from the NCFM discusses sentencing.   > Column 1 indicates that after controlling for the offense level, criminal history, district, and offense type, blacks, Hispanics, and others received sentences 5.5, 4.5, and 2.3 months longer than whites, respectively, and females received 5.5 fewer months than males. All of these results are significant at the .01 level. The average sentence length is 46 months, so evaluated at the mean, blacks receive about 12 percent longer terms than whites, and males receive 12 percent longer terms than females.   112% is not the 166% quoted in the article you linked.

This is the natural progression of unchecked feminism for the past 30 years.  "Rape culture," Violence Against Women Act, Etc.  The subtle brain training we've all undergone has made it so incredibly painful to just come out and say that "All women in the United States hold a trump card, and they're aware of how to use it against men they don't like."   The only reason you're seeing a mug shot is because she actually assaulted him on video.  Had she not done that and just filed a false report, she would still be free, with the capacity to do god knows what.   The infuriating thing is also that false accusers are likely to repeat their behavior because no punishment exists for said action.  It's like refusing to punishing a child: If they know they can get away with it, they'll just keep doing it.  She's likely done this to others, and will continue to do this to others in the future.   Kobe Bryant, Ray McDonald, Brian Banks...  The list goes on."
videos,"This happened to me   My Story,   I was DATING a girl for 3 months. We went out one night, she started an argument in the car with me. I admit I did tell her to "Shut the fuck up!" and about 5 seconds later, she punches me in the face while I am driving. She was drunk, I was sober btw.   At this point, I planned on going back to my place, running up to my apartment and locking her out. I successfully managed to do so, and she started banging on the door yelling and screaming in the hallway of my apartment. I look down at the coffee table and see her purse, with her wallet and everything in it. I cracked the door open and she FORCED herself in, dumped out the contents of her purse and is continually yelling and screaming and crying. Asking me "WHY!?!?! WHY!?!!" like a total fucking nutcase.   I kept repeating, please leave, call your dad to come get you, call someone to come get you, you hit me, you are NOT staying here.   Then a 5 foot tall 100 pound girl comes flying at me, windmilling punching me and somehow manages to TAKE ME TO THE GROUND. I am 6 foot and 180.   This is where I made a huge mistake.  I said "If you don't leave, I will call the cops on you"   She said "If you call the cops I will tell them you have some weed in here (I had about 2 joints stashed away I was 25 at the time)" I said "If you do that we will both go to jail" She said "Not if I tell them you HIT ME"   I called 911 on the way out the door grabbed my keys pulled to the front of my Condo, and waited for the police to show up.   I stand outside and talk to them while they go upstairs and talk to her. I tell them the WHOLE STORY. 5 mins later the other cop comes downstairs, talks to his partner and they tell me to "put my hands behind my back" and that I am being arrested for DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/Family VIOLENCE/Assault Class C misdemeanor.   While pulling away from my apartment, I ask the police if I can lock the place up. They said, does "Name Redacted" have a key, I said NO! They said, well if anything is missing or if she breaks or steals anything just call us back out here and we can charge her with vandalism or theft. And that if they let her leave, she would be "public intox" and that would just piss her off more. I was freaking out at this point. In handcuffs in the back of a squad car for the first time in my life. THIS IS A GIRL I AM DATING, NOT LIVING WITH AND THEY LEFT HER THERE.   THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I DID WAS LAWYER THE FUCK UP!   Even though it is not a MAJOR CRIME, I think I was charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The cops told me "its just like a traffic ticket" DO NOT LISTEN TO THE COPS.   This isn't just any charge, it carries A LOT of weight. It automatically issues a protective order against you. You are not allowed to possess a firearm of ANY kind EVER. Domestic Violence is a serious charge.   I was able to walk through jail, I paid $500 bail, had my Mom come get me. We pull up to my apartment about 2 hours from the time I was put in handcuffs. And THE GIRL IS STILL INSIDE MY APARTMENT! My mom goes upstairs tells her she needed to leave or get a ride home or WHATEVER. (thank god she left) She had done a couple loads of laundry, made my bed and tidied the place up a bit. (VERY SCARY)   IMPORTANT STUFF HERE I GOT A LAWYER THE NEXT DAY FIRST THING. I know it is shitty but here is all of the advice he gave me. He said "She will try to contact you, keep every email, text message, voicemail, IGNORE ALL PHONE CALLS. If you do respond to her only say ""I still love you but I can not talk to you until this is all over"" I thought this was pretty fucked up, but this is coming from a very expensive attorney. He said it is important to give her a "glimmer of hope" and that most girls that pull this type of shit are familiar with the system. (either had fucked up parents, or did the same shit to ex-boyfriends) He also said that my best shot of getting the case dismissed is her not showing up to court. (she knew this and reminded me too) So this is what I said to her in every email that I responded to.   > "This situation is VERY serious. You know I did not and would not do anything to hurt you EVER. I still love you and care about you but I CAN NOT talk to you until this stuff is over with and behind us"   Keep it simple, she sent me page after page of emails, love letters, hate letters, psychotic voice messages, text messages.

videos,"This happened to me I didn't have video.  I went to jail.   My Story,   I was DATING a girl for 3 months. We went out one night, she started an argument in the car with me. I admit I did tell her to "Shut the fuck up!" and about 5 seconds later, she punches me in the face while I am driving. She was drunk, I was sober btw.   At this point, I planned on going back to my place, running up to my apartment and locking her out. I successfully managed to do so, and she started banging on the door yelling and screaming in the hallway of my apartment. I look down at the coffee table and see her purse, with her wallet and everything in it. I cracked the door open and she FORCED herself in, dumped out the contents of her purse and is continually yelling and screaming and crying. Asking me "WHY!?!?! WHY!?!!" like a total fucking nutcase.   I kept repeating, please leave, call your dad to come get you, call someone to come get you, you hit me, you are NOT staying here.   Then a 5 foot tall 100 pound girl comes flying at me, windmilling punching me and somehow manages to TAKE ME TO THE GROUND. I am 6 foot and 180.   This is where I made a huge mistake.  I said "If you don't leave, I will call the cops on you"   She said "If you call the cops I will tell them you have some weed in here (I had about 2 joints stashed away I was 25 at the time)" I said "If you do that we will both go to jail" She said "Not if I tell them you HIT ME"   I called 911 on the way out the door grabbed my keys pulled to the front of my Condo, and waited for the police to show up.   I stand outside and talk to them while they go upstairs and talk to her. I tell them the WHOLE STORY. 5 mins later the other cop comes downstairs, talks to his partner and they tell me to "put my hands behind my back" and that I am being arrested for DOMESTIC VIOLENCE/Family VIOLENCE/Assault Class C misdemeanor.   While pulling away from my apartment, I ask the police if I can lock the place up. They said, does "Name Redacted" have a key, I said NO! They said, well if anything is missing or if she breaks or steals anything just call us back out here and we can charge her with vandalism or theft. And that if they let her leave, she would be "public intox" and that would just piss her off more. I was freaking out at this point. In handcuffs in the back of a squad car for the first time in my life. THIS IS A GIRL I AM DATING, NOT LIVING WITH AND THEY LEFT HER THERE.   THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I DID WAS LAWYER THE FUCK UP!   Even though it is not a MAJOR CRIME, I think I was charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The cops told me "its just like a traffic ticket" DO NOT LISTEN TO THE COPS.   This isn't just any charge, it carries A LOT of weight. It automatically issues a protective order against you. You are not allowed to possess a firearm of ANY kind EVER. Domestic Violence is a serious charge.   I was able to walk through jail, I paid $500 bail, had my Mom come get me. We pull up to my apartment about 2 hours from the time I was put in handcuffs. And THE GIRL IS STILL INSIDE MY APARTMENT! My mom goes upstairs tells her she needed to leave or get a ride home or WHATEVER. (thank god she left) She had done a couple loads of laundry, made my bed and tidied the place up a bit. (VERY SCARY)   IMPORTANT STUFF HERE I GOT A LAWYER THE NEXT DAY FIRST THING. I know it is shitty but here is all of the advice he gave me. He said "She will try to contact you, keep every email, text message, voicemail, IGNORE ALL PHONE CALLS. If you do respond to her only say ""I still love you but I can not talk to you until this is all over"" I thought this was pretty fucked up, but this is coming from a very expensive attorney. He said it is important to give her a "glimmer of hope" and that most girls that pull this type of shit are familiar with the system. (either had fucked up parents, or did the same shit to ex-boyfriends) He also said that my best shot of getting the case dismissed is her not showing up to court. (she knew this and reminded me too) So this is what I said to her in every email that I responded to.   > "This situation is VERY serious. You know I did not and would not do anything to hurt you EVER. I still love you and care about you but I CAN NOT talk to you until this stuff is over with and behind us"   Keep it simple, she sent me page after page of emails, love letters, hate letters, psychotic voice messages, text messages.

videos,"I don't understand why some women do it either. I could never do that kind of thing.   My friend has always dated crazy ass women, the most recent baby mama was the worst one IMO. One weekend she went to the beach with a guy she "considers her brother" - supposed to be gone 2 days because their baby was still only a few months old. The third and fourth day I watched the baby for him, on the fourth day she said she would be back "around 3". He got home from work at 10pm, she still wasn't back so he locked the doors and went to bed.   Midnight comes around, she calls him and said she's almost back and he needed to unlock the door for her (she didn't have a key to their place), he said no that she could just stay with that guy because him and the kids were in bed. She threatens to call the cops and say he hit her. He unlocked the door and went back to the bed, she told him to go to the couch. He has sleep apnea and she didn't "allow" him to sleep in his own bed because it was hard for her to sleep. He refused and she called the cops saying he hit her. They figured it was a stupid domestic squabble and told him to leave. He paid the bills, did nothing wrong, he had to leave his own place.   He ended up staying with my husband and I that night, and we told him to leave her. A couple of weeks later, he gets smart during one of her freak outs and records her yelling at him, screaming at him, hitting him. They showed up and arrested her crazy ass and he got a restraining order against her."
videos,"How many wrongful convictions should we allow?  Is there some kind of ratio?   There actually is.  It's called [Blackstone's ratio.]("
videos,"No. I don't care if I get down voted for this. The problem of the race issue in America is not black it is white. But it is not black and white, like many would have you believe. Even if America didn't have racist laws, police officers, social standards and political practices racism would still exist in America. Black people have been systematically subjugated since their shackles were loosened. You will find no physical shackles on the black youth of today, but you will find the shackles of a broken society. One where a black youth is 5x more likely to go to prison 1/25th as likely to own a home and 1/37th as likely to get an education than his white counter part. Where were these types of people when wells fargo increased the sub-prime mortgage rate in Baltimore, leaving literally millions homeless and destitute. While this man may have the right intentions he's incorrect. The problem isn't people wanting to being thugs or gangsters, the problem is the explicit pernicious racist practices that are passed and endorsed by politicians. The problem is that out of all the CEO's in America only 6% are black. The problem is that when you grow up as a black person you're faced with a reality far different than that of a white person. You're faced with racist hiring practices, racist citizens and an overtly racist media. If we want to stop things like this from happening we need to stand up to corporations and the government and let them know that as citizens we will not tolerate the treatment these people receive. You may disagree with me, but you shouldn't. The prominent individualistic ideologies of modern America have been its undoing. There are things at play much larger than the individual and people need to wake up to the fact that regardless of how hard you try and how little racism you reinforce it will exist as long as racism is not confronted head on. Don't base you ideas off of something as anecdotal as this video, obtain a working understanding of sociology. Racism, sexism and the like are not easy to recognize in society, because they're so fundamental to our way of thinking and the way our society operates. It isn't until you realize the biases you and society hold that you are really able to analyze subject matter like this."
videos,"Dude that thing was fucking cute as hell. If this were switched around and some singing bear paid to shoot that fucking hick asshole in the lung with an arrow it would be ok with me though. If you want to go out and hunt a wild animal, feel fucking free. I have absolutely no problem with the legal killing of game, but to shoot a old tame bear trapped in an acre for no other reason than to look super badass is such a fucked up thing to do. Maybe if he killed the bear with his hands or something I would be ok with it, but with a bow and arrow...in a fucking tree 20 ft up where the bear cant get to really just makes me want to beat the shit out of that guy with a bat."
videos,"Possibly, but let's not bash too much. Anyone who's a certain mild level of tech savvy develops their own preferences, and doesn't buy into commercials like these.

The dedication to their favorite form of entertainment is kind of strange to people who may not like comics, and even people who happen to like things that are  like  comic books (not exactly sure what this is in this analogy...just bear with me). Ditto trekkies. Ditto Whovians. Ditto Star Wars fans. (I'm 2 and a half out of four here)   The point is, it doesn't make sense to you because you're not into it. I know, this is sort of a tautology, but that's sort of it. There are millions of different tastes out there; it just so happens that my tastes in entertainment happens to include a blend of acting, athletics and theatrics.   Completely unnecessary"
videos,"my mom, a middle school civics and reading teacher, is up every day at 5:30, drives a 30mins-1hr commute to get to school by 7:30, and teaches until 2:30. she packs leftover soup for her 40-minute lunch hour, which is spent grading assignments. during that 7:30-2:30 working period, she's teaching, designing lesson plans, meeting with individual students, helping younger teachers, meeting with administrators, and dealing with the near-weekly "kid brought a weapon to school" incident--and hers is considered one of the safer schools in the city. after 2:30, she meets with more students and/or parents (usually until about 3:30, but basically not until she's dealt with all the miscellaneous daily necessities), and then prepares for tomorrow's lessons. there's at least one after-school faculty/department meeting per week, and she's the moderator of the after-school "homework club" (tutoring/making sure students do their work). in the summer, she works on the curriculum-planning committee. oh, and she also happens to be the school's union representative. when she retires in a couple years, she'll probably need to take a job in a parochial school to supplement her pension and savings.   the most amazing thing about all this is that this level of commitment is the norm for teachers in her school. and the type of work they're doing isn't the type of work you can give 50% effort to. there's little, if any, down time, and you have to be a special subset of "people people" to connect with young students. many of whom, by the way, are coming from horrible conditions at home.   i don't know how any sane person who knows a teacher could think teachers are overpaid. if anything, we need to pay these people more, and find ways to attract college graduates to teaching jobs, because there simply aren't enough people willing to do the work nowadays. it confuses and sickens me that politicians and commentators could pick  teachers  as the problem in society."
videos,"I actually didn't mind the movie.  That being said I was terribly disappointed when I saw it because it was promoted as a comedy with Robin Williams using humor to become President.  A comedian becoming president wasn't remotely what the movie was about and furthermore, it certainly wasn't a comedy!   Watching the movie without the pre-conceived notion that you are about to watch a funny movie makes it much better.  I say this regardless of the fact that the "computer programming error" or whatever that was would have taken some insanely ridiculous programming just to make happen, it certainly wouldn't have been a simple oversight from a programmer."

wicked_edge,"Gradual beard reduction.   You had a lot of scruff, admittedly bad technique... And 1 coat in you're going against the grain?   Slow down rambo.  This war doesn't need to be won in a day.   First understand that by not shaving often your hair and skin are not used to it and thus not prepared.   Just do 2 with the grain passes just trying to thin it out... Not baby butt smooth by any stretch.   But do this 5x a week or every other or something.  Keep at it.  Take steps to heal your skin, soften your beard and keep practicing."
wicked_edge,"My blade seemed to have gotten quite dull, quite suddenly. But, as always with questions of this type, the best answer is obtained by trying it.

wicked_edge,"I actually switched from Shavette to straight razor a couple days ago. I have to say, I much, much prefer the straight. It feels nicer, and has a much more satisfying weight to it. Since most shavettes use half a DE blade, I find their shorter length to be really annoying. Cream accumulates faster, and you have to wash it more often. Shavettes also tend to irritate your skin more in my experience. Every time I shaved with mine, I felt like a cactus. After switching, no irritation whatsoever."
wicked_edge,"Unless you have a compromised immune system, I don't think you  ever  have to sterilize a safety razor.  The only exception would be if you buy one from somebody you don't know, who may have some sort of blood-borne disease.  Even then the lifetime of such diseases on a dry surface is short.   You have to remember that your entire environment is  swarming  with bacteria, some of them harmful to human health if they get out of hand.  That's true,  even right after you sanitize a surface.   In much smaller numbers, but they're always there, unless you use an autoclave or something like that.   And in fact, even the inside of your body (your intestinal tract) is literally awash with foreign bacteria and fungi.  Some non-trivial portion of your body weight is comprised of foreign micro-organisms.  Don't even get me started on what's growing  outside  your skin."
wicked_edge,"Um, no, because it is an essential oil and it is too strong for your skin.  IT is an unsafe thing for you to do.  You might get away with it for a while, but soon you will develop a chemical sensitivity to it and never be able to use it again.   If you want, you should dilute it in a carrier (pressed) oil.  I would recommend coconut or sweet almond oil.   Think of it this way, if you have a headache and take a Tylenol, it goes away right?  For a bad one, say you take 10.  Then you need a new liver."
wicked_edge,"There is no such thing as the "best" blade. There is something called the "best blade for you". Some would argue that Feathers are the best; plenty of people on this sub don't like Feathers. Personally. I hate Astras with the burning fire of a thousand suns, because they do nothing but give me terrible razor burn while leaving stubble."
wicked_edge,"I strop before and after each shave and while the necessity of it might be arguable, it is the process that has been used for centuries to keep edges keen.  Linen and leather will not  sharpen  as they won't remove steel from the razor; it simply keeps the edge aligned and your bevel straight.  Honing is the process of sharpening by removing steel.   My rule of thumb is that if a shave is uncomfortable  at all  then I do about 50 passes on linen and 100 on leather.  If it continues to be uncomfortable then I go to my highest grit abrasive, which happens to be a strop pasted with chromium oxide, but could otherwise be a 10k+ grit stone.   Once you become proficient at shaving and stropping then your razor will last longer before having to go to the hones.  In lieu of actual whetstones you can look at felt or leather treated with either chromium oxide or diamond paste, both of which are  slightly  abrasive.  Additionally you can find many "barber's hones" which are small high-grit hones that can be held in the palm of your hand to refresh an edge.  These are the hones that most barbers kept at their stations for shaving."

WorldofTanks,"With the low tier stuff on the German side far too diverse(e.g 3 tier 6 meds that are very different from each other) I'll concentrate on where they really start characterizing themselves (Tier 7+).   German mediums are the most heavy like of mediums they turn their turrets/hulls slowly,take longer to stop and reverse and all of them are snipers (0.28-0.3 acc.) since the point of a medium is to scout in CW you don't see them much there.   Their heavies(except the Tiger (H), Ausf A) are also the most heavy like , having the best front armour(turret armour is a bit iffy though on everything without the Henschel turm) and the slowest speed. They also have ,except for the E-100, access to the most accurate guns in their tier although by tier 9 this is no longer as large an advantage.   *Note all German tanks at those tiers can turn in place.   Soviet mediums have a playstyle that's all over the place  as the T-34 can be used for everything but peek a boo fighting in heavy cover which the T-34-85/T-43 excel at, T-44/T-54 changes this up as they are both the most light like of mediums with the fastest acceleration lending themselves to flying around flanking enemy heavies in wolf packs.   Soviet heavies can be classed into two groups, which after the revision will have 2 definite lines for each. The mobile heavies containing the KV-1S, IS, IS-3, IS-7 and the traditional heavies with the KV, KV-3, IS-4. The mobile heavies often have less armour than their German counterparts but the highest top speed among their peers. The slower ones often do best exposing quite a bit of side armour (front and side of the IS-4 and KV have the exact same values)   *Note all Soviet Heavies and the T-34-85/T-43 have the slowest aim times in their class and no Med/Heavy of their's can turn in place.   US tanks almost always have the best moving accuracy, best gun depression and are also often agile. They also have the largest mantlets(M4A3E2 and Tiers 7+) with which they utilize in hull down positions to render them partially invulnerable although by tier 9 their turret armour is no longer the best. The only medium they have with frontal armour is the M4A3E2 the rest and also the T34/T30 are usually behind their peers in this regard.   *Note unlike the other nationalities, where it is only available at Tier 8+, the Vertical stabilizer is available on the Chaffe and at Tier 6 onwards .   TDs and SPGs are best described individually."
WorldofTanks,"Doesn't play like a light tank simply because it isn't a light tank.. WG just made it a light tank so it would fill a hole in the light tank tree and ease crew retraining. In french it's called the Char Moyen AMX40, which translates to - Medium Tank AMX40. It was planned to be a medium cavalry tank, replacing the SOMUA S35, but no vehicles was built due to the outbreak of WWII. And with pre cold-war french naming traditions the '40' indicates that it was planned to be built in 1940. It's a paper tank, like many others in WoT. For its time, this looked like an advanced and potentially excellent tank, with great armour, sloped madness, diesel powered, good suspension and with the possibilty to drive without tracks. It was planned to be fitted with a new and improved type of final drive system which would compensate for the lack of engine horses. WG doesn't take this into account though, and I have no idea how it would work IRL.  Weighing less than 25t and being as adequately armoured as its contemporary counterparts; Panzer IV, T-34 and M4 Sherman. This tank would definately be a danger to be reckoned with. Imagine if it got further down the road and got equipped with a KwK/48 or an American 75/76mm M1 gun. Even in its current state, being a T4 tank with a mediocre 75mm gun, this tank can still be lethal to any of the above mentioned tanks if they're inexperienced, dumb or simply don't consider the AMX a big enough threat. Have killed quite a few T5's in this duckling who underestimate it.  That's enough digression for today!"
WorldofTanks,"I have the FCM and the only medium like property it has is alpha and speed. Things I dont like: huge, turret armor is nonexistent (no hulldown), the oh-look-a-french-tank response from arty, and the gun dispersion upon movement is bad. Granted the pen is nice, but the engagement distance the FCM prefers is more medium ranges where you rarely have time to fully aim a shot to hit weak points.   Tanks that fall in this grey zone I find annoying to play. Camo snipers and in your face brawlers are both great to me, but the FCM just doesn't have a great role to me.   Sometimes this tank will shit a 5k damage game which makes me never rage sell it."
WorldofTanks,"Agree. For me the problem is that assault is sometimes balanced...but only if the average standard of player on both teams is good. I lost too many games attacking where my team did nothing for 8mins and I am forced to try an assault, pretty much alone, and often in a TD, while the heavies watch. And then the tomato defenders win by default, even though they've done nothing except sit and dribble. So I turned it off. Kept encounter for variety, though."

I wish stats were part of the vanilla client, at least in a sense that players could see it during a match. If just the Personal Rating was shown along with player name and tank name, that would be just fine. Then, when XxJoeBlowxX says "Everyone go valley, it's the best way" on Lakeville, everyone can see that this guy is a god damned moron and they might not listen to him for a change.   People like stats. We want to visualize how much we are improving, and we want something more defining than how much we win...Especially in a game where one person can only do so much to ensure a victory. I want to be able to SEE that I am 500 points better than I was a year ago or whatever.   And guess what, I play for fun too. But what is not fun is losing match after match after match because you keep getting put on a team with 10-14 players who "play for fun" and regularly accuse people of having armor hacks. If you can sit and play this game for 5, 6, 7, 10+ THOUSAND battles, how the fuck can you not figure out where common weakpoints are on virtually all tanks in this game? Or when you should turn around to reset cap, or look at your minimap and see the 7 tanks about to shoot your whole team in the ass...These "people" (I put that in quotes because I'm convinced many of the players in this game would barely qualify as human on some census reports)  play game after game after game and ignore every piece of advice given to them and go on thinking they are right. because, that one time, going valley worked on lakeville, so it's obviously the best way."
WorldofTanks,"In their defense, the maps aren't very straightforward in this game, and the tanks are pretty flexible (in general; and roles change depending on battle tier).   Sure, but after ten THOUSAND battles, it seems like you should be able to figure out the 15ish maps they have in this game. Or after 300 battles in a specific tank one should know its relative strengths and weaknesses. All I ask from pubs is to drive to the correct location and die slowly enough for my platoon to carry the other flank and make it to theirs before they colossally fuck up too hard for 3 tanks to fix, but even that is too difficult for >80% of the player base.   >Why isn't there a CW winrate?  A Tourney WR?   Uhhhh.... There is and everyone that cares pays attention to it. The OTTER WoTmanager page has a list of every battle we have fought in the last 5 weeks (duration of the VILIN/RELIC war) whether it was an attack, encounter, or defense and our win ratio against each belligerent on each map. WGLNA standings are clearly published for each league including specific game win rate, not just match win rate. And finally, all other tournaments are published in the forums with each team's win rate and the group stage results and winner's bracket on the main site. If you wanted to know right now how my tournament team is doing in the current skirmish you could look it up. Or if you wanted to see how my WGLNA team was doing you could look it up too. And for CW the global map is updated every hour if you care to follow it or you could be lazy and ask for compiled win rates from clan officers."
WorldofTanks,"If you really want to play this game you can get by till tier 6 easily without spending any real money on it. Tier 6 is one of the most fun tiers in the game so that is not at all a problem.   The advancement "speeds up" considerably the better you get at playing. A good player can easily do two to even three times as much base exp/credits witht he same tank than a bad player/beginner.   So, yes, unless you are very resistant to playing tanks well, you should notice an increased income over time.   Additionally the net credits income for non-prem tanks is best around tier 5.   That gives you a lot of room to experiment, learn the game, and find the lines you like (if any) before you really should consider spending money on the game.   If you want to advance to tier 10 prem account helps a lot. Without it it is still very possible but advancement slows down considerably after tier 6 and gets very slow for non prem accounts at tier 9."
WorldofTanks,"Extremely slow  - Can't react or influence the game like a IS-3/110, 50 100, or even a T32 can. This is a hugeeeeeee liability.   Mediocre gun  - Im actually not extremely familiar with the gun, but from experience fighting it, it's nothing to be too afraid of. Im guessing it shares characteristics with the T32, in which the T32 wins out with the hull down capabilities and mobility.   Armor - The armor becomes somewhat irrelevant with someone who knows where to shoot it, gold rounds, or a combination of both. Like /u/xNovember said, all you really have to do is prioritize other tanks, and leave the KV-4 alone until it's time to cleanup for an easy kill."
WorldofTanks,"The learning curve isn't steep.  It's linear.  You are always learning.  Every time you buy a tank a tier higher you have to learn to play that tier,  that tank,  the new enemies weak spots, etc...   Steep learning curve is when you learn to play the game in the first 400 matches and you get it.   I have 10k matches and I have half a clue of what to do sometimes in some Tanks on some maps."
oddlysatisfying,"This isn't actually RES's doing.  It's due to the subreddit style, and is because of this rather overreaching CSS rule:   * {   border-radius: 0!important; }    Which gets rid of any rounded edges in any element in the page.  Since the RES throbber is just a square with rounded edges, take off the rounded edges, and it becomes a square.   The circles on either side, on the other hand, are psuedo-elements (:before and :after), and apparently they aren't subject to the * global style."
oddlysatisfying,"My best guess is that this is a simple hand-held "conveyor belt" with the belt fixed on top and a tray slide pushing it out (rubber band or springs retract it when the tray slides back in). It'd be like picking up stuff with an excavator shovel sliding on the ground, but without the dirt pushing against what is already inside the shovel. The fixed belt pulls everything in, so no force is pushing anything on the belt away.   In terms of hydrophobic coating, I guess it'd actually be counter-productive. A sticky but sealed surface of the belt would probably work best."

C25K,"First why do you say that was a failure? Sounds like a success to me. The biggest thing is what you take away from it. Everyone has there own pace but I would say for this long run and with your hills try to go a 7 or 8 min kilometer 8 feel free to allow yourself to go slower up the hills. Also make sure you do your warmup and then spend some serious time stretching out those legs especially your calves, you will want to do 2/3 different calf stretches(assuming that's where the burn is)."
C25K,"In my experience - stick to the program. Whenever I start to jump the gun in running, the first few runs go great. Then I go harder and longer for the next run - then the next. Soon my body betrays me and starts hurting.   Once I went from the couch to a 6 mile run around fifty minutes. It went great, and I had never run 6 miles in a sitting before. I kept trying to go to where I had jumped, and I ended up quitting because my body hurt so far."
MarvelPuzzleQuest,"I think I screwed up. I'm a transitioning 2->3 player. I only have 2 3 star characters actually properly fully covered (hulk and bp), but during the last event I leveled those two to 102. I think that was a big mistake because most of my core roster is still 94 2 s.  I have a few other 3 s I can level to 102 but they're not really properly covered. But I think in Gauntlet and other PVE events I'm going to kind of not be as competitive until I can get more of my 3*s fully covered..."
GreatScenes,"There's something about this scene. I'm not someone who cries from movies, but the second he says "mom", the feels are too much.. After he realizes he is going to pass out soon, and that he may never regain consciousness the character just breaks down in 2 seconds, and he's suddenly just a scared kid who just wants his mom. Props to JGL and the writers, this scene put this movie in my all time favorites."
atheism,"Nobody will look at it that way.  The binding of Isaac is one of the cornerstones of faith for all chirstianity and has been analyzed to death over the past few centuries.   I'm all for critical analysis of religion, but this particular issue has already been beaten to death.  Anyone who has taken a sophomore level philosophy of religion class has read Kierkegaard's  Fear and Trembling  and explored this issue in depth.  The response that everyone is having here of fear or anger is one that completely misses the point of the story.  Not to say that killing your son on a whim and then noticing a goat at the list minute to kill instead is something that is acceptable, but interpretation of that event within our own social context makes no sense.  Faith here is "infinite resignation," something that is completely external to social context.  Kierkegaard did a very good job explaining the Binding of Isaac and using it as a platform to attack Hegel.  These arguments played out quite some time ago and this particular issue has all but been laid to rest because Kierkegaard was right."
atheism,"You've put a lot of effort into this.   Or not... Make it clear that you're quoting from another source next time.   And include the"
atheism,"Provided your original comment was actually made in earnest I offer this more complete response: the reason I gave you a dismissive comment is because your argument is terrible, regardless if it is your position or not. Provided either Christianity or Islam is correct, do the adherents of one choose the torturous punishment of the other? Does an atheist choose the torture of both from a complete lack of evidence of the veracity of either?"
atheism,"First off, Christmas isn't really Christian. (Correct me if I'm wrong with any of this) At first, there was a pagan celebration at about that point in time, which included the evergreen tree. The Christians wanted to convert people, and so they made Christmas to appease the pagans, make it easier for people to switch to Christianity.   The getting of presents and the like isn't really what Christmas is about religiously, just capitalistically. So, celebration of Christmas really isn't celebrating a Christian holiday, just celebrating a holiday that has become ingrained in our society. That is, unless you do things like go to church, and take part in all of the Christian parts of the holiday."
atheism,"Clearly there is waste that exists in government programs and yes, money goes to things that I don't agree with. But with that being said, government programs  in general tend  to be more efficient and have better outcomes than their private counterparts (where such comparisons are possible, e.g. prisons, healthcare, education). There are certain things that, no matter how hard one tries, one cannot (and, perhaps should not) make money doing.   I believe it was on the Nerdist podcast where Neil deGrasse Tyson said that private business has never been the one to break new boundaries in science. That has always fallen to government. The risks and investment costs were far too high to make a profit going to the moon in the 1960s for any private business to do it. Same thing goes for social security, medicare, building the highway system, national defense, and so on.   Are all of those programs perfect? Of course not. But is Social Security one of the greatest examples of a strong government program that actually helps people by allowing them to maintain a very basic standard of living once they've retired (which leads to a ton of other societal benefits)? Yes. Medicare recipients report higher satisfaction than most people with private insurers all while having less waste  and more actual paying for treatment . The major problem with Medicare is cost control. And that is something that is a universal problem among insurance providers."
atheism,"from what I've gathered, anarchists don't have any kind of reasonable alternative on the table, just the completely naive belief that without government, the world would be a better place.   I could argue that your argument is equivalent to saying that without the bible people would have no morality only the completely naive belief that things would work out without it.   To me being against governments is like being against rape. Its besides the point to go on to explain how people would figure out how to have sex with each other without it. I could talk to you all day about dating services and pick up bars and the like but unless I hit on a method of meeting someone that connects with you on a personal level then you can just say it would never work. You might say its a bit extreme to equate the state with rape but to me the very thing that distinguishes a government from a company is its ability to force people to do things that they don't want to and force them to pay for it. To me it is a completely naive belief that such a system could actually be all of the things that people say it is. Especially when people living in totalitarian regimes are saying the same thing about their glorious government. In fact all of the things people say anarchist systems will be like are pretty accurate descriptions of what governments actually are right now.  I am forced to pay for things that I find destructive and immoral like killing people I have never met or paying to have people force me to not do things that I want to do or even things that I would be paying for anyway but the state takes a 70-90% cut. I disagree that voting makes all this ok. Just because a person chooses to pick one person rather than another to rule over them does not mean they approve of any of them.  Now you might be asking for all of the solutions to all of the problems that might ever exist. The only answer I can possibly give is a wide sweeping one. The first thing to consider is that not all anarchists want to get rid of the current solutions that the state provides, they just want it paid for voluntarily and not monopolized or licensed. Now objections to this no doubt immediately pop into your head but please consider that in order to get your money a company must convince you to pay them. So there will be people out there actually thinking of ways to solve problems better than the current solutions in order to get your business. This may seem like an unreasonable assumption but it is the way things work for everything other than what the state provides including a lot of what the state claims to provide but actually contracts out to private industry for already.   The other common objection is that people will free-ride or simply not pay for a service but please consider that there may be answers to these questions that already work for services (including communal services). Think about how you would solve these problems if you couldn't force people to pay for the solution."
atheism,"Disagree! Most people here (lower Alabama) are "retarded or mean or intolerant". EVERYWHERE I go I am subjected to the same bull shit. The worst part is it isn't just constant rambling on about religion. It's having college professors who second guess and tweek lectures as not to offend. Had to sit through two science classes spreading the idea that the way the human body heals could be considered "a slow miracle" and an evolutionary psych class where the atheist professor is compelled to say "well, you don't have to believe it, but I have to teach it." This on top of a rampant fear that all of the elementary school children are carrying guns and fingering each other is enough to drive someone bat shit crazy. If I had a dollar for everyone woman I have heard complain that the reason their kids have to wear uniforms to school is because they all have bombs (I swear this happens all the time, perfect logic) I could supply every welfare mom with a carton of Marlboro Reds and enough fruit punch to give all their kids diabetes."
atheism,"I think OddSko was pointing to the fact that there's been crimes against humanity with or without religion.  To ignore Stalin and Mao's pride in their Atheism and their vitriolic (and completely understandable, given the circumstances they lived under) disdain for religion is ridiculous.  The hierarchy of sentiment in "excuse" of many Communist leaders' atrocities only serves to wash over the extremity of their Atheism and disconnect it from their actions.   It's strange to see people show pride in their "militant Atheism" while shunning any militant theism--obviously, not a physical militant stance but a personal, vocalized one.  Instead they get memes demeaning them and their beliefs.  Militant Christianity can range from an oblivious will to help to, unfortunately, offensive, unreasonable "strategies" that are based out of fear and uncertainty rather than love and faith.  But to describe oneself as militant and seemingly not understand why "peaceful Atheists" (...as opposed to non-peaceful Atheists?) find their particular brand of Atheism annoying, offensive, ignorant, and more pointedly ironic, simply fazes me.   This part isn't really a response to NukeThePope, but fuggit:   I grew up with a lot of resentment for my Atheist beliefs and up until the point that I realized I did not believe in God I felt like I was going through a lot of angry emotions towards people who tried to convert me, tell me I was wrong, etc.  But there's always different groups of people, and with any significant IDEA--just like a. God or b. No god are ideas--there will be different interpretations.  I'm not going to take all my exposure to a certain sect of a larger group of people and label them all according to my one-sided perspective, because I would be a really, really ignorant asshole, and I wouldn't be much different than the people who'd always tell me, "Oh, you're an Atheist?  So you have no morals?" based off their limited interaction with Atheists and Atheism.  If you cease to understand this and appreciate other people's views than your behavior is more in line with the people you apparently can't stand and must ridicule."
atheism,"just like ye olde traditional Christmas celebration, practiced for hundreds of years, with public nudity, drunkenness, cross-dressing, dogs marrying cats; the whole shebang.   And no, I'm not talking about Saturnalia. I'm talking about what people actually did in England to celebrate Christmas, and why those so-called founders of our "Christian Nation" came over here to outlaw Christmas.   It was secular then, and it was still secular after the Victorians changed it into a gift-giving exchange with Santa in the 19th century. The arrival of the middle class, as well as the arrival of mass production made this inevitable. I wonder sometimes if the frenzied shopping has merely replaced the season of "misrule" that was at the center of the Christmas celebration.   The real traditional Christmas was misrule, where the "lower classes," the peasantry, were allowed to let off steam by play-acting at swapping places with the nobility and the clergy. It came to a head when densely populated cities like New York saw mass rioting in the streets by gangs of poor youth, and, of course, labor movements. The organizers of the new style of quiet Christmas celebration, such as John Pintard, a city planner, were big-time landowners, capitalists, and basically city leaders who saw value in taking men and boys off the streets and out of the taverns on Christmas, and putting them back into their homes--after they bought what they needed in the shops, of course. The new Victorian sentimentality (and the emergence of the middle class) created something called "childhood" which was rather unknown before. This allowed rich families to transfer their yearly Wassail donations to their own children--the money need not leave the family.   The religious observance was brought back into Christmas through the efforts of, not the religious right, but the religious left. Far left.   The Unitarians.   So next time they blame you for the "War on Christmas," remember that it was religious zealots who started it (think Cromwell), but it was secularists who won."
atheism,"The "point" is that the Christianists who want to have a live Nativity scene are not "practicing their religion." They are practicing a political act of Speech.   Of course what I said in the hyperlink was a lampoon (kind of assumed that was understood), but if a group that wants to make a Speech statement of basically bullying everyone else into accepting their version of events, other groups should make statements, too. That's the myth of America, right? Equal opportunity?   The real "point" here is what I said in the comment, rather than the one sentence hyperlink comment, which I suppose will be what's read."
atheism,"I think what pisses people off is how you guys make an adviceanimal like this and pat yourselves on the back about something that should be a selfless act. There are worse ways to get attention and affirmation though, that's for sure."
atheism,"Sir, I would like to say that there are many other atheist charities and secular charities alongside the many good religious organizations.  It does nothing to bash people when they give to (smart) charities.  Also everyone likes a pat on the back for their good deeds and feel pride in something they (collectively) accomplished."
atheism,"Bachman has used kids as pawns in this game the whole time." is a tu quoque fallacy. It's not alright when Bachmann does it, and it's not alright when this mother did it.   Except, the mother didn't do it.  The mother just finished the communication circle.  Bachman said this to the kid through her public persona, and she brought the kid to Bachman to see who she's saying it too.  That's different than I say something in private, you go home tell your kid, then bring them to me to make me say it to their face.   >it's clear that it wasn't the kid's idea.   Maybe.  I used to teach martial arts classes and I had some kids who wanted to be there, but their parents pushed them to be the ones to ask me.  I had others who talked for their kids, who had no desire to be there.  After a couple decades of teaching, the thing I learned, is that the students who were forced to ask themselves was always the kids who wanted it, while the parents who did it for them, it tended (not always here) to go the other direction.  As a result, I began making sure I asked the kid if they wanted to be there before class if the kid didn't ask me to join.  Many times he said no."
atheism,"I don't come from a religious family and my parents more or less left me to it belief-wise but I went to a wonderful little Church of England and up until secondary school I considered myself a christian.   At about the age of 5 our regular teacher was away and we had a substitute. She set us the task of picking a bible story and making drawngs to be put on the wall. Being the hipster that I was I picked a story that we had not been told in class but I had heard in church (my grandmother took me when she visited). Everyone else was doing the good samaritan, jesus in the desert or Adam and Eve. I chose the story of Abraham, only I got it wrong.   In my head God tells Abraham to sacrifice his son who then takes his son up to the mountain, can't bring himself to do it, refuses and God reveals he has past the test. So my picture was Abraham and his son on the Mountain, a sword on the floor, and a big hand coming out of the cloud and pointing. I finished it off with a big speech bubble from Abraham saying "NO!"   As the drawings are being pinned to the wall the teacher notices mine and asks me which story it is supposed to be, I tell her, and she asks why Abraham is saying "NO!" so I tell her, she tells me I made a mistake and that Abraham passes the test by saying yes. I can't wrap my head around this as it seems to make no sense whatsoever, I tell her it is her who has it wrong, she then makes the mistake of 'correcting' my picture. As a child one thing I could not stand was people drawing on my pictures so  lose it and call her "a stupid" and tear up my own picture.   I don't actually remember much off this myself, It was recounted to me by my old teacher (who had been away on that day) on my last day of Primary school, the substitute had told her what happened. She told me she has never been so proud of one of her students and she had repaired and kept my picture."
atheism,"Like you, I was born an atheist.     My parents did not indoctrinate me during my upbringing, so I stayed an atheist.     A few attempts have been made by people in my adulthood to try to convert me to Christianity.  One was a very underhanded approach using apologetics.  A woman I was interested in gave me a few books by Josh McDowell to read.  I had not thought about religion much up until this point, so I was initially confused by what I read and seriously considered converting.  But I was able to see the flaw in the arguments -- the flaws betrayed McDowell as being dishonest in his argument.  I was so ticked off by his that I decided to "bone up" on the issues and transitioned from being a superficial atheist into a very hardcore and well informed atheist.     The second attempt has been on-going.  One of my close childhood friends is a creationist.  He's taken it upon himself to try to "save me".  He has no idea how futile this is.  At this point, I am so atheist I make Richard Dawkins look like an ayatollah.  He keeps throwing bizarre nonsense he gets from creationist websites at me in hopes it will sway me.  I've even told him that I actually do "opposition research" up front to debunk this garbage.  It has not deterred him.  I asked him one question in response: look at the Vostok and EPICA ice cores and explain to me how objects that are 400,000 and 740,000 years old can exist on a 10,000 year old planet.  That was 4 years ago.  He has yet to answer this.     The only time I ever go to church is to attend funerals or other people's weddings.  I try not to make a fuss about it unless someone else brings up something -- it hasn't been an issue so far.     Like most atheists, I didn't  decide  that god doesn't exist.  I simply put it in the same category as Santa Claus, the tooth fairy, the lochness monster, big foot, and so on.  There is no better reason to think god exists than any of those things, and they all are more associated with childish thinking than reality.     When you are a child you ask questions from teachers and parents because you don't know anything.  When you are an adolescent you ask questions from your peers because you want to fit in.  When you are an adult you ask questions of the universe because you can and the answers are more reliable.  The church is hoping that people stay in the first stage, and to be a surrogate for the parents and teachers for people who are not young or in school.  Regardless the church has no answers, so even for the questions I do have, I would not seek answers there."

atheism,"My mind was not made up for me.  There are three books (in English) that I particulary remember having     A copy of Tell Me Why   A book on Dinasours that also had short chapters on the fromation of the Solar system, and Evolution after the dinasours   A thick  book of very nicely illustrated Bible stories      Somehow I never even suspected that anyone would percieve the Bible stories as anything more then just stories. I could say myths but I don't think 9 year old me really knew that word. Meanwhile the other two books read like they where about reality. I remember declaring that I believed in Science not God.   At around the same time I also volantarily went to after school bible study (because they gave out cookies) And even when to Church with a friend and his mother (I remember being very bored and fidgety).  A while later I was forced into Scripture class at school (1 hour per week) when the new Principle decided that he didn't want any non-scritpure pupels in his school.  So I learned About Catholicism and the Bible but none of it could shake my, at the time naive, faith that science had better answers.   As A teenager I tried on Norse Paganism, and Buddhism.  Then studied Psycology and Phillosophy at University. Post Uni I  tried on 19th Century Occultism, mostally based on the writings of Alister Crowley and later  Wicca. And every time ended up back at a naturalistic world view, though each time somewhat less naively so."
atheism,"Becoming an atheist because of that makes perfect logical sense if you think about it. What we have here is the Problem of Evil.   A claim was made to her, and that claim was proved wrong. The claims can be many, but here it seems that one could be that "in church, God is more present, because a church is God's House."  If you ever went to church, you've heard this.   What kind of God would let this happen in His house?   And how would you worship Him?   Another claim destroyed would be that "God is all-good and all-loving."   A God that let this happen in His house could not be good.   Therefore, at the very least, this God could not exist.   She was already an atheist towards other Gods, so this one was finally vanquished.   So it makes perfect sense that this incident should make her logically an atheist."
atheism,"I'm atheist. My parents make me go to the mosque because they don't know. The Imam says to treat all people with respect.

atheism,"Respect... see heres the problem, alien005, when i say we shouldn't respect islam you call me a hypocrite, suggest im narrow minded, and generally suggest I should not be respected. Why? Because I don't respect "religion". When Islam, however, has it written in the koran that infidels like you and me should be put to death, you say "hold on now, I don't agree with that but lets respect it!" So tell me, why the different stance between my intolerance and Islam's intolerance? If anything you should respect my intolerace because I don't tolerate a choice to be hateful whereas Islam's intolerance is about petty things like gender. But alas, you think the label "religion" affords Islam some special status and I say thats bull shit, which was my original point."

atheism,"Check out Lost in Shangri-La. I usually don't recomend books on random posts, but as soon as I saw this it made me think of this book. My dad gave it to me & said that I'd like it & that I'd probably never heard of this.  Here's the review from Amazon:   On May 13, 1945, twenty-four American servicemen and WACs boarded a transport plane for a sightseeing trip over 鈥淪hangri-La,鈥?a beautiful and mysterious valley deep within the jungle-covered mountains of Dutch New Guinea. Unlike the peaceful Tibetan monks of James Hilton鈥檚 bestselling novel Lost Horizon, this Shangri-La was home to spear-carrying tribesmen, warriors rumored to be cannibals.   But the pleasure tour became an unforgettable battle for survival when the plane crashed. Miraculously, three passengers pulled through. Margaret Hastings, barefoot and burned, had no choice but to wear her dead best friend鈥檚 shoes. John McCollom, grieving the death of his twin brother also aboard the plane, masked his grief with stoicism. Kenneth Decker, too, was severely burned and suffered a gaping head wound.   Emotionally devastated, badly injured, and vulnerable to the hidden dangers of the jungle, the trio faced certain death unless they left the crash site. Caught between man-eating headhunters and enemy Japanese, the wounded passengers endured a harrowing hike down the mountainside鈥攁 journey into the unknown that would lead them straight into a primitive tribe of superstitious natives who had never before seen a white man鈥攐r woman.   Drawn from interviews, declassified U.S. Army documents, personal photos and mementos, a survivor鈥檚 diary, a rescuer鈥檚 journal, and original film footage, Lost in Shangri-La recounts this incredible true-life adventure for the first time. Mitchell Zuckoff reveals how the determined trio鈥攄ehydrated, sick, and in pain鈥攖raversed the dense jungle to find help; how a brave band of paratroopers risked their own lives to save the survivors; and how a cowboy colonel attempted a previously untested rescue mission to get them out.   By trekking into the New Guinea jungle, visiting remote villages, and rediscovering the crash site, Zuckoff also captures the contemporary natives鈥?remembrances of the long-ago day when strange creatures fell from the sky. A riveting work of narrative nonfiction that vividly brings to life an odyssey at times terrifying, enlightening, and comic, Lost in Shangri-La is a thrill ride from beginning to end."
atheism,"The priest/pastor has done just what you have done he has found meaning for his life. It is based on things not seen, but that is not unusual human beings believe in unseen things all the time. God is like Mathematics an imagined perfection. Science is a different way of perceiving the universe it produces knowledge of how to manipulate or exploit existence. It is seen as superior to religious faith. It isn't that religion cannot give meaning to life it is just not as fruitful a pursuit as science.   This is why I see no benefit in debating theists they are not wrong for understanding what they do. Nor is the atheist wrong in their understanding.   We see things diffeently.   Science and Religion both can do great harm if misused. From an historical perspective we tend to focus on the harm of relgion and why not there is a rich history of stupidity performed by man in the name of God. Science has only been around a few hundred years and yet it has given us Saran Gas and thermonuclear bombs. It has enabled 1 man to kill hundreds of thousands at once if not more. Religion never put that much power in the hands of one man. (Not even the Pope).   For some people religion is easier to understand and follow. Religion is tolerant of imperfect understanding. Science is a harder path requiring rigorous and thorough understanding. There are bad scientists to be sure but it is much harder to fake an understanding of science rather than a fake understanding of religion.   A true man of God accepts it all and is above doctrine and scripture but this type of understanding is rare. One of the greatest sayings I ever heard when I studied religion was "The best way (form) to worship God is every way (form)." The point of all religion is to get to the transcendent state where you experience the peace and contentment of a life well lived. When people of religion argue about the different practices or run around judging heretics they are being fools silly monkeys. So atheists who criticize theists are mainly criticizing those with an incomplete understanding of religion. They criticize the stupidity and hypocrisy of ignorant practitioners. They do not know the truly good theists who are humble and generous and strive to live up to their vision of a good life in service to their "God". These people do not run megachurches they may not even worship in a church synagogue or temple. They are quiet followers for the most part. And they do not hate or pity atheists or anyone else for that matter. They wish everyone could come to the understanding that we are all in this together and should work together to make life better.   Their path to understanding is hard it is easy to stumble along the way. Science allows us to understand reality with rigorous discipline. It doesn't try and answer the unknowable questions but attempts to understand what is."
atheism,"Everytime I speak up in class I always get people upset with me - it's not my fault that the facts disprove the teacher, or that I just happen to retain obscure shit like that...   It really isn't..."
atheism,"I agree with your analysis of the phrase "survival of the fittest." It does not even fully encapsulate evolution. Some species develop features which are not in their best interest to increase survivability. Species must also be able to reproduce.  Case in point to illustrate this: Male peacocks are very well known for their colorful trains. Studies were done which indicated that the trains increase attractiveness towards peahens. Their tail were not shown to intimidate predators in any way, contrary to popular belief (ie. creepy eyes). While having a bright, shiny, cumbersome train is not a trait which increases survivability, it does increase attractiveness."
atheism,"Oh please, this is a ridiculous statement. This whole "woe is me, poor little atheist" shit has to stop. It is things like this that only further divide us (atheists) from people who adhere to a monotheistic religion. Two groups that are so strongly divided are much less likely to communicate and seek to understand each other. History of man has proven that two groups like this rarely reach a resolution that ends well for both sides. As atheists we are not burdened by centuries of rules, obligations, ideals and highly inaccurate ancient texts. If any one is going to be the voice of logic and reason then it will have to be us, because it will most likely not be them. To play into the atheistic elitism that runs rampant here think of it this way; we are the peace loving intelligent ones and they are they savages. Play your part accordingly so that you breed a good opinion of us.   The circle jerk that is r/atheism is more guilty of intolerance and hate than most Christians I know, and I know a very many. It is a perfect example of the pot calling the kettle black. I was raised in a christian home, attended a christian school K-12 and attended church 2 times a week through out my childhood. I swallowed what I was fed for a very long time, I only came to find atheism through my own desire for knowledge and in effort to find understanding in a world full of so many questions. I did not come to atheism through some little entitled, elitist, college junior atheist with a chip on their shoulder. Which is exactly what some of the people on this board come off as. If I had ran into one of these types during my quest to understand the world I can assure you I would not have been as likely to drop what I was taught my entire life in favor of "your beliefs".   The exact things you fanatical atheists despise in fanatical theists are the same things you are guilty of. As an atheist in this country you are not persecuted or discriminated against in any significant way. I am not saying that it doesn't happen, I am saying it is very unlikely. So this analogy comes of as very skewed to me. We as atheists are not persecuted by theists in remotely the same way as non-whites are persecuted by the KKK. A theist may JUDGE you for being an atheist but so what? Everyone judges everyone, its human nature. Get over it. Being an atheist in america, hell even being an atheist in the bible belt is such a "first world problem" that it is just begging for a meme generator."
atheism,"No, I understand. Hitler thought he was doing good, but he wasn't. Yeah, I get it. But that's a bullshit argument.  REAL  morality is  NOT  subjective.   If I think raping women and killing puppies is good, it doesn't mean that it is. No matter how much  I  think it's good, it never will be. It doesn't matter what Christians  believe  to be good or bad, that fact is some things are bad NO MATTER WHAT. There is no "subjective morality" when it comes to raping little boys, torturing people because of what name they call their god or feeding someone hot coals and boiling water because you think they have demons inside them. YOU can think it's good all you want, and I and can think it's bad all I want, but at the end of the day it's bad because it is bad, not because I  feel  that it is bad.   So no, I am not confusing MY morality with that of others. YOU are confused that the idea of absolute morality can be subjective. It cant be. Charles Manson can think starting a race-war is just fine and dandy all he wants, and I can disagree with that view all I want but at the end of the day IT IS WRONG. Not becuase  I  think it's wrong but because IT FUCKING IS WRONG. Thinking something is ok when it isn't doesn't make it ok. So Christians  think  they are making the world a better place, but they arent. Absolutely regardless of what I or anyone else thinks. Some things are immoral no matter what ANYONE's opinion is. Period   So yes, christians might think in their minds what they are doing/wanting is moral, but they are wrong. That's not a valid excuse.   "Christians want the world to be a "better" place. The issue is that their conception of "better" is different from yours."   No, it's not that their conception of better is different from mine: IT'S DIFFERENT FROM FACT. It has abso-fucking-lutely nothing to do with opinion of preconceptions of me or anyone else."
atheism,"Just so you all know. If you want to donate your organs or tissues, MAKE SURE YOU TELL YOUR LOVED ONES. I worked in the Organ and Tissue donation line of work for 4 years. I can't tell you how many people DON'T get to donate because their family says no DESPITE the person being a registered donor. Pretty much works like this. The companies have legal rights to recover from a registered donor, however, due to the sensitivity of the subject, when a loved one dies, its the family that we have to work with and we don't want to make enemies. They often don't know the wishes of their lost one and don't want anything done to the body that they think will defile or ruin it. So make sure you clearly tell everyone what it is that you want done with your body when you die."
atheism,"take you seriously   This is what it's really about. It isn't about intellectual honesty, or pursuit of truth, or social progress, it's about which dickfiddling monkeyman has the more social currency and privilege.   What you hate is that I have my own system of currency and don't give a fuck about your patriarchal dick-bux. People like you can't stand that. you can't stand that I am using satire to make a serious point, because the implication is that you aren't worth giving a legitimate scholarly reply to. You wouldn't even understand it. It infuriates that sense of god-given priviledge that you feel in your bones without having ever legitimately questioned it."
atheism,"My wife died 3 years ago July 1st. We buried her on the 4th. We were both atheists, but her Presbyterian family insisted on a traditional religious service. I figured that if that's what her parents needed to help them through their grief, then I would not object.   So the pastor (or whatever his title was) starts the service and goes on for 45 minutes about kids dying in the bible, and parents grieving. Suffice to say, this did NOT help her family.   Once the chapel service was done, and we moved out to the cemetery, I told him to fuck off because he was upsetting my mother-in-law and royally pissing me off.   So I stood there in 102 degree heat on the 4th of July and gave her a proper graveside eulogy. The more devout of the mourners got pissed at me, but weren't disrespectful enough to say anything to us. Her parents virtually tackled me in tears, thanking me over and over."
atheism,"I'm actually curious as to what a soul actually is?  I'm assuming it is your "soul" the would transcend to heaven correct?   If your soul closely resembles any idea of "self" then that would be a construct of the mind.  You'd be surprised of how many areas of your brain I could cut and you'd have no idea the who, what, when, where, or how of anything.  The brain is such a magnificent organ that literally constructs every little thing, even the idea of you believing in a soul.   But if the soul is some celestial entity that climbs into "heaven" then I follow your logic metaphorically.  But literally speaking, you'd need your brain to function in order to actually be yourself in heaven and actually compute the environment that heaven is."
atheism,"I told my girlfriend about my non-beliefs, and how i don't need to see fairies in the garden for the garden to be a beautiful place. I'll go with her to church when its convenient, visiting parents, or just to show my respect and support.  There are some Catholics out there that aren't super religious, they keep the faith because the traditions give them a framework to live in. Kinda like secular Jews.  I ended up marrying this woman; I'm very happy and I think she is too."
atheism,"I'm confused as well, but I tried to come up with something based on the dictionary definitions. I'll get to hokum, but I feel like explaining the whole picture too. :)   Hokum: (Merriam Webster definitions) >1 >: a device used (as by showmen) to evoke a desired audience response > >2 >: pretentious nonsense : bunkum   I think the picture is saying a few things. The first thing you notice is that while the religions are different, the descriptions are the same, making them very similar. Yet they are both saying that they wish the other was more like them, even though their only difference is their religion. This makes you wonder how religion can make us all feel so different from one another yet we are really all the same.   Then you get to what the words say. "Easily Weaponized, Superstitious." Makes you think about how these two groups of people can be easily frightened by the other and form false beliefs due to them being different, but if their are both doing that what is actually causing them to feel threatened?   So from the definitions of Hokum I would say the first one might be the meaning here, and that each side comes up with lies (superstitions) about the other to cause their side to feel threatened by the other. This causes sides to become "weaponized" and causes dangerous situations to arise based on differences in religion. So I guess the second definition holds true as well, that is all pretentious nonsense created to keep us in fear of one another."
atheism,"What about if a team of highly trained operatives flew helicopters into the private compound of a leader, shot him in the face, and dumped his body in the ocean?   Oh, wait, shit. We did that.   But no, no, no see  OUR  violence is always justified, and  THEIR  violence is never justified. When  WE  act it's for the greater good. I'm sure  THEY  twiddle their mustaches and cackle like Dr. Evil before they use violence."
atheism,"I think you've quite missed the point of the general hostility towards normally right-minded religious people who, when giving condolences to people in need, pray for them. The reason that many atheists show ambivalence or even anger towards these people is because the act of praying takes away any responsibility for actually providing help, because in some sense they believe that "God" has played a part in saving/helping the person or people in need. Atheists feel that all the credit should go to the human beings who actually provided assistance. Atheists like me believe that religious people are simply passing the buck (to borrow an American phrase) by spewing out platitudes such as this. I agree that religious individuals are generally generous people and will give their time and money to charity, but simply saying that they will pray for someone is worth nothing in my opinion."
atheism,"A tweet of mine regarding Fabrice Muamba's on-field heart attack recently resulted in a torrent of attacks from some rather hard-line atheists, none of whom were following me.   My comments basically stated that I was getting sick of other atheists taking the oppertunity to snipe and generally be a douchebag to anyone using the #pray4muamba hashtag. Further comments I made stating that plenty of folk, religious or atheist, were using the tag to support the stricken player were rubbished outright. Basically, if I didn't agree with them I clearly wasn't atheist.   Nearly all of them shared a commonality. The first serious thing their profiles said about themselves was that they were athiest.  Personally, I can talk about many other things that make me who I am as a person, before reaching the subject of atheism.   You're atheist, I'm atheist. Great. We don't believe in gods. We believe in science and fact. We're not relegious. Awesome, glad we got that out of the way."
atheism,"Good stuff sir! I feel fairly strongly about this and you've just put into words what i couldn't be bothered too. So I feel silly now so I'll give my two cents on the matter.   I was recently in hospital for a long time and was in pretty bad shape. it was a given that I would be there for a while so someone had to phone my Landlord and explain that I won't be able to pay my rent for a while because I was in hospital. I am a cynical bastard so i did not expect a decent reaction. in fact he said it was fine and I should just pay when I'm well and able. Pretty awesome. Fast forward 7 weeks or so and I'm just out of hospital and my Landlord drops round, right out of the blue and these were his words. 'I prayed for you every day. Can you drink? i'm gonna buy you a crate of beer.'.   Now I'm an atheist and was really taken aback by this. I interpreted the gesture as saying 'I thought about you and wished that would get better'. I feel that alot of atheists would have interpreted this as 'hurrr I helped you get better because I prayed to Gawwwd hurrr' but this is not the case at all you silly people."
atheism,"In every group there are jerks. The Simpsons taught me that. (STAMPY!)   I think that there exists a fine line here.... and it's all about context and interpretation. A lot of comments have touched on this.   How many people imagine a smug, 17 year old kid with an emo haircut, sitting in his parent's basement?   Try thinking about someone who just lost parts of his life, possibly everything, a man who no longer has a home, or pets, and possibly lost a family member. In THAT instance, I can kind of understand a smarmy bitterness.   It's the difference between "Tchyah, whatEVer. Your god is like, totally fake" and "Bitch, if you want to help me, then  actually  help me."   That is an  important  difference.  Context. Interpretation.   Now, do if someone says something about "prayers for a sick child", then... really, most people aren't doctors, so they're not going to be able to directly help. Could they donate to research? Sure. But I think in THIS instance, the "pray for you" thing is an "I'm here for you." It's to help let this person feel that they are not alone, that they have friends, etc.   Pick your battles. Don't try to knock down the sense of community and support. Do point out that prayer is completely ineffective if it's being used as a way to alleviate guilt through inaction when action is required. Example: saying "I'll pray for you," to a kid that broke an ankle when a trip to the hospital is in order.   (Now, I will say that I also understand the argument that, when the sentiment is expressed to you, being silent implies consent and agreement with the statement and all its baggage. And that letting that implication stand could weaken the strength and independence of the atheist community. [We stand as godless, but tacitly accept the idea of god helping us.]  So....yeah. that argument can be made. But I think it needs to be made at a  separate  time. )   Just my two cents."
atheism,"Here's the problem. Well wishes are good, but people consider them good enough. It's not. People need to take active steps to help one another. I'm aware this will be buried under a thousand comments, but it's the humanist inside of me that you hath angered. If all you can do is pray, that's fine. But if you could do more, you should. I'm not able to do much at my age for people. This makes me even more angry at the people who can, because I would kill to have the chance to go to Dallas and help, or send money, but I can't.   It's not that prayer is bad. It's that they are convinced it's enough. It's not. Help people. God would commend that. Your heavenly figure would tell you to do so. Yet all you do is sit and wish them to be better."
atheism,"I was in the same boat you were in (Age wise, not views on health care).  I'd just gotten home from 3 months in South America, I got home right before Xmas so I wasn't looking for a job.  On the way home from a Christmas party the car I was in got hit by a drunk driver.  I was knocked unconscious, I woke up in the ambulance, after 8 hours in the ER, xrays, and a CT scan.  I never got a bill, but I'm pretty sure that I wouldn't have been able to pay for that bill and school.  I now have a STEM degree and work a good job contributing to society."
atheism,"I like your point of view, but I'm one where I sometimes find some sort of spiritual interest of a god existing to proving myself wrong about the existence of a type of god existing. I'm constantly in flux. I'm personally surprised that 99 % of the world isn't this way as well. I'm personally surprised that the rest of the world tries to ask religious questions and qualifying those questions somehow and writing them down as evidence in a book.   Back on point, as I find more and more atheists in existence, it would seem that a drive in life for some would be a longer lifespan if they personally are too have a longer "dent" on the world. I guess I was only viewing it from a DNA point of view. My reasoning was out of generally the cause or a link can be made to state that this is where most problems arise, be it because the DNA doesn't go too far to overcome problems (chain smokers who get cancer as opposed to chain smokers who get on fine) or DNA doesn't replicate right.   We do in the medical field give topical solutions to deeper issues. The classic examples are giving a high-blood pressure patient medication instead of treating the real issue of food intake. I would go a step further and argue that our DNA is designed to continually add nutrients to the blood stream (cavemen days needed all they could get for instance) instead of having a signal to turn off the excess nutrient flow into the blood stream.   Granted, sadly, we are definitely not there yet. Of all of the people who look to life as being the Apex of existence, it would seem the atheists would be gunning for this type of research.   (Can't wait to watch that video, I think it will touch highly on what I want to know !)"
atheism,"I have two. One's in university now, youngest is finishing high school this year.   Exposed them to every religion that was practical to do. They liked the Buddhist monastery very much, but they happened to be going through a bit of a kung-fu phase so that might have played into it. Anglicans had the best snacks.   My youngest is essentially an apatheist. My eldest is a strong atheist, which is a more extreme position than I have (agnostic atheist when pressed, apatheist when left alone) but he's at that age where he's got more balls than brains so I expect his stance will moderate over time.   (Edit: in case you were wondering, we were living in Vancouver at the time and there's a broad and eclectic collection of mosques, temples etc all more or less within an hour's drive. Even scientologists, creepy fucks that they are. This approach may not work very well if you're not living in a religiously diverse community and all you can show your kids are various flavors of protestants.)"
atheism,"Many, many religious people really  would  meet the clinical definition of "delusion" if specialists would stop tiptoeing around the issue. In many cases, I would argue that it's blatantly pathological.   There's more to delusion than believing things that happen to not be true鈥?as I'm sure you know, it's more about  continuing  to believe in those things even after being presented with overwhelming evidence that they are not true."
atheism,"Vitalism鈥攖he insistence that there is some big, mysterious extra ingredient in all living things鈥攖urns out to have been not a deep insight but a failure of imagination." --Daniel Dennett   If anyone wants more context on any of the close-as-I-could-jot-down quotes, I'll be happy to provide it. One of the worst parts of having to listen to this guy was the fact that he would sweep directly from actual medically supportable information straight to utter nonsense. Gives the good back-crackers a bad name."
atheism,"Funny, I took a European History class this semester. First thing the professor said was basically, "Think as historians in this class. Don't let your personal thoughts color what you learn here."   Of course, I understand this, and I have no problem analyzing things as they are without looking at them through the lens of my personal opinion.   Next class? He began slowly building up to a rant about how much he hated people saying "Happy holidays" as opposed to "Merry Christmas" and how America was a nation founded on Christianity. He just kept going on and on and on. Eventually I just couldn't sit there and listen to him spout this crap anymore, so I got up, left, and dropped the class. I only got half of a refund because I didn't drop the class before the second day. I also didn't get a refund on the book I rented for it."
atheism,"Language was invented so we could better communicate our ideas/thoughts with the people around us. Dogs, for example, don't need to say, "Go to the store and buy some milk," because food gets put in their bowl every day. If there isn't food in their bowl, then they communicate with body language (running to the bowl, scratching at the bowl, etc) and/or barking. Now if they're saying, "Hey, put food in my bowl, I'm hungry!" or just using noise to attract our attention, we don't know. Imo, dogs are just like babies. They use indecipherable sounds (crying/barking) to express a need for something. By tone, length, and pitch, we may be able to assume (and assume correctly) what the dog is trying to tell us.   Personally, I don't think any other animal aside from humans have invented spoken language. A dog has simple needs, thus it doesn't have a reason to say, "Don't forget to pick up the dry cleaning," or, "Slow down, there's a police car behind you." Dogs have X needs, thus they need to be able to express X feelings. Humans have an infinite number of needs, so they need to be able to form an infinite number of sentences."
atheism,"That's basically my viewpoint these days. Most of these atheists on reddit are just as bad in my opinion and my best friend is a diehard christian. The reason I left the faith was more of a personal reason. The thought of sinning being impossible to avoid while everybody/god judges you just puts a ton of weight on my shoulders while most Christians insist that the faith is supposed to be a relief/privilege.   Furthermore, the fact is the the bible was written by human hands and the new testament is basically a revision written by a bunch church officials. I can't deny that the bible teaches some great practices, and I can't deny that many of those church officials who wrote the new testament completely believed and sought after a better society, but it disagrees with me fundamentally. When I was a christian I tried to create this "connection" with god for years. I'm a skeptic by nature and I was keeping my eye wide open for any evidence that there was anything there while being careful not to fabricate anything just because I was desperate.   Those were years and years of failure. I sang loudly, I cried in desperate attempt, I held my hands up, I joined church groups, and I looked for help from various wonderful religious people in my life (pastors, relatives.)   The fact is for my entire life everybody told me that all I had to do was believe and open my heart for jesus and I would have a relationship with god, but the fact is that I was committed, hard working, and passionate for years and every minute of the way I never got a single shred of evidence that I had achieved some sort of spiritual connection. I kept asking myself why It was impossible for me while every-day all around me people were "saved" and talking in tongue and feeling the power of jesus when I was apparently excommunicated.   So, Long story short, I finally gave up and tried a different view that did not drive me into self hatred. I tried a view that has more solid evidence and things I can understand step-by-step. As a general rule I think most Christians have just convinced themselves that certain feelings are actually from god, but I still have the same feelings I just call them different things and I think they're caused by by different things.   The truth is that the world is not really a nice place and Christianity/religion can be a great masking/coping system for many. The only real reason I get upset with Christians is because I have achieved a mostly non prejudice way of viewing people of different races/religions and most of the time I'm thrown out for treating Muslims equal to Christians. (mainly because of my location in the world [bible belt])"
atheism,"For me it was an old family friend that almost constantly thanked god for the people she worked with. or for the sun shining. or for the nice rain today.   The majority of the time it wasn't even my tragedy, but due to the amount of her posts, there was almost always another friend going through genuine sorrow at the time.   I think in times like this we can equate the feeling to that of jealousy. I know when my cat (of 21 years) died in my arms, I almost wished I could be consoled by a god. I wished I could think "she's in a better place" or "I'll see her again". But I know she's not and I know I won't. At least in my instance she had been in pain for quite a while, so I had that thought to help me. I wish there was something I could say that would help you, but I'm afraid the most I can do is remind you that you have a lot of empathetic readers right now, sharing in your sorrow."
atheism,"I know that, in the America we were all told existed in middle school, we wouldn't have to worry about things like this. But if you know you live in a part of the country where your employers can and very likely will fire you for not holding Christian beliefs, it might be a good idea to, I don't know... not bring atheist literature to work with you? Especially if you're relying on that job to feed your family. I mean, it shouldn't be that way, but it is, and ignoring that's probably not going to work out all that well. Principles won't put food on the table. Fuck it, I'm an atheist, and I've openly pretended to be a Christian in order to get work."
atheism,"If the government is not supposed to regulate things (one of the "big" ideas of libertarianism), Then that government is, in fact, NOT protecting your from "good" or "bad" corporations.  In fact, there is no such thing as a "good" corporation.  They are completely morally blank, as the only motive of the corporation is profit....if they must destroy the environment to turn a profit, they will, etc. etc.  Beyond that, as we;ve seen over the last decade plus, deregulation does NOT lead to more competition, but rather less.  If the government does not step in to make sure that smaller less cash rich companies cannot be swallowed up by the already huge rich companies, then there is LESS choice. An excellent example is every business prior to early 21st century trust busting.  BEfore that, the government didn't regulate the size of corporations....there was less choice, not more."
atheism,"If God exists science has to be able to observe him. Why do some scientists believe this is not so?   That is not true at all. Your statement is only true if God exists inside the closed system which is our universe. What a typical christian scientist (which is not an oxymoron, by the way) would say is that the singularity from whence the universe came was created, placed, and set off by God. Therefore God is outside of our universe.   If God is outside of our universe, then there is literally no way to collect any scientific data about him because we cannot even speculate about what conditions would be like outside of the universe. Literally nothing we know even applies there.   Put it to you this way. Let's say God doesn't exist, and the notion of Him has never come up in the history of human existence, your perfect world. Speculate about something that exists outside of our universe.   Speculate about another universe.   You can't. You don't even know where to begin. What if gravity didn't exist in another realm? What about time? What about the strong nuclear force? What about atoms?"
atheism,"Don't bother thinking about this too hard. People just play with words and make stuff up to try and convince themselves and others that they are right."
atheism,"I gave you an upvote, but I slightly disapprove.  (As if my approval might mean something.)  I too am thankful for stars, but being thankful for something more personal does not mean you are conceding the existence of god.  This seems like a slightly inflammatory response, and though it may be completely true, it seems a bit contrived.  You can be rational and still be grateful for family, friends, and the other things that make life livable."
atheism,"As a pizza guy, I can sincerely say, fuck you. We drive TO YOUR FUCKING  HOUSE with a HOT MEAL for your ungrateful ass. That costs actual gas money. Most drivers don't get much gas money at all, AND are paid less than minimum wage for road hours (I get $4.15).   People like you are the problem in the delivery business and the reason that this business is filled with burnouts and shitty workers. Maybe if you actually tipped the person who hand delivered a fresh pizza to your door, hard working drivers like me would be more inclined to stay in the business.. It's not a matter of us feeling like we deserve your money for driving 10 miles, its a matter of economics and human decency.   And please don't give me the classic "I shouldn't have to pay your hourly wage, the pizza place should pay you more" routine because guess what.. DRIVERS MAKING $4.15 AN HOUR IS THE REASON YOUR LARGE MEAT LOVERS PIZZA COSTS $10.   All you non tippers fail to realize that the price of food is directly affected by how much the employees are paid. Also, you look like a fucking asshole if you don't tip (not to mention your just embarrassing yourself in front of friends, gf). Who in their right mind would want to be the source of hundreds of peoples ruined days? Oh right, a narcissistic hate-filled person."

You keep saying it's important and insisting there is a role, but when I ask multiple times for more information you respond like this.  Look, if you don't have a reasonable argument to back it up, we can move on.  You're perfectly entitled to a point of view without evidence or reasonable argument.   > i don't really believe that argumentation even works, directly   Fine then, what does suggesting this guy is closeted gay going to do indirectly?  Or at all?   >are much more effective, if not persuasive.   what is the indirect effect of suggesting this homophobe is a closeted gay?   >again, you should be skeptical, but the study found that they tend to be gay   dude, it doesn't mean he's definitely gay. this is a fact. we don't know. it's likely that he is, according to the research, but again, i ask you, how is this of any use?  Accuse him of hypocrisy?  He'll simply deny it, and continuing to call him gay will transform your accusation into taunting--you are now being unreasonable bullying tactics.   So again,"
atheism,"If you think that "science" is some infallible, mystical tome floating out in the sky somewhere, with all the rules and explanations for the universe just waiting to be discovered and neatly copied down; if you think THIS is science as opposed to the blind, groping, stumbling human institution in which personalities and reputations are as influential as actual results, then you shouldn't be posting this in /r/atheism. Have you ever spent time around REAL scientists?"
atheism,"And yet that anonymity isn't always enough for people to say, out loud, that they are atheists. If it was a phone survey, they have your phone number. And if they have your phone number...well, put it together yourself. When there are fundamentalists out there that believe atheists should be registered like sex offenders, a lie can many times allay the fears  of being "found out" and ostracized or confronted or discriminated against.   Also, while I sort of understand your Buddhist conversions argument, another problem with the survey is that it's not asking about beliefs, but about religions. People have a desire to be a part of something bigger than the individual and will reach out to religion many times to fill that void. It doesn't mean that atheists suddenly believe in a god, it means they want something more than what they have had. Sometimes it's pantheism, paganism, deism, atheistic Buddhism, etc.   I once embraced Buddhism as a "way of life" and rejected the notion that it was a religion. During that time, I still believed in a higher power and eventually went back to Christianity before shedding all supernatural beliefs and openly stating my atheism (to myself and close friends only due to fear of rejection from my family). If I went back to Buddhism now, as an atheist, I still wouldn't believe in a god or higher power and yet may chose to label myself as a Buddhist. That doesn't mean that I'm not also an atheist. And  this  is why the survey is flawed. It simply asks what were you raised and what do you consider yourself now and if there is a change, it's set as a hit against the initial group.   Where's Universal Unitarian? Pagan? Secular humanism? Any other association with belief and not religion? Remember, people like labels. It helps them file things away in their mind and shorten the amount of time necessary to form opinions."
atheism,"I'd like to respond to the second question.   My answer: Who cares? This is my opinion of course, but even if an omnicient and omnipotent being created the universe, it would be nothing like theists describe it. Do you really think such a being would be jealous, violent, attention craving, hypocritical, sexist, racist, ... etc? With its unlimited power, do you even think it cares about a damned thing that happens on Earth? Given the scope of the universe's existence, our species exists in a blink of an eye to a being of that nature.  Why would our existence matter to it?   Regardless, the existence of such a being as described by theists contradicts itself (an omniscient being cannot be omnipresent). It also still does not answer the question of infinite regression, which I fear is impossible to answer."
atheism,"I'm 15, and I do believe in God, but I hate him.   Why do you believe?  Perhaps you should examine that position.  You mention Christians and the Second Coming - so the God to whom you are referring to is the monotheistic YHWH/Yahweh/Jehovah/Allah/God of Abraham (all names for the same Deity).  What supports you belief in that Deity vs. the other 6000+ deities for which you appear to be atheistic?   > To help me see clearly, could you recommend me something to read?   Specific to the monotheistic Yahweh - A foundational belief in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) is that Allah, God, or Yahweh/YHWH, is the only true revealed God. As this is also the core of the Tanakh (Judaism), Bible (Christianity), and Qur'an/Koran (Islam); questions concerning the source of, and the validity of, this monotheistic Deity would raises significant doubt as to the Holy Book's validity as the word of God/Yahweh/Allah. Yet, within the Holy Scriptures of predecessor Ugarit and Canaanite, and early Israelite religions/societies/cultures, the evidence points to the growth in the belief of the monothesitic Yahweh God from a polytheistic foundation of the El God pantheon in the ancient Ugarits and Canaanites who became the early Israelites. Yahweh (son of El, the Father God) was a subordinate fertility/rain/warrior local desert God whom, through a process of convergence, differentiation and displacement (synthesis and syncretism), was elevated to a monolatry and then to a monotheistic Deity.   Evidential sources related to the development and growth of Allahism/Yahwehism:     [Israelite Religion to Judaism: the Evolution of the Religion of Israel](   [The evolution of God](   [Ugarit and the Bible](   [The Ascension of Yahweh: The Origins and Development of Israelite Monotheism from the Afrasan to Josiah - PDF warning](   [The Early History of God: Yahweh and the Other Deities in Ancient Israel]( by Mark Smith   [The Origins of Biblical Monotheism: Israel's Polytheistic Background and the Ugaritic Texts]( by Mark S.

atheism,"I don't believe you've thought this through sufficiently. You're imagining the vast scale of the universe and assuming that anything is possible, but in this case its scale is the greatest obstacle.   The universe is a large system of mostly stars, perhaps 9x10^21 in the observable universe. But it's a  single system  and therefore cannot "evolve" in any sense that would promote a degree of organization that might be construed as sentience. An eyedropper with 0.27 CC volume of water (less than six drops) has 9x10^21 molecules in it, and it's not going to be intelligent or even  living , because there is no conceivable process that would bring it to that point in isolation--as the universe most certainly is, and even if there were there's simply not enough complexity there to work with.   Use ourselves as an example. An adult human brain masses about 1.4 kilograms. It's about 77% water, 11% lipids and 8% protein, so it has around 1.4 x 10^26 atoms. That's about 16,000 times as many atoms as there are stars in the observable universe.   And those atoms can react together  instantaneously , with even the slowest thought crossing the brain in less than 录 of a second--that's 125 million traversals before a child is even a year old. Compare that to the universe, or even one galaxy. A light-speed impulse takes 100,000 years to cross the Milky Way, and could have done so only 110,000 times since it formed. The universe itself--even the  observable  universe--is too large for an impulse to cross it  at all , so there's simply no way for one side of it to share any kind of sentience with the other side.   Even if you allowed stars to somehow function as synaptic analogs, or allowed solar winds to interact intelligently, or made pulsars carriers for nerve impulses, what does that get you? There's simply not enough time to develop intelligence. Even if you allowed for vastly more time, say  hundreds of trillions  of years, and 10,000 times as many stars, all while keeping the universe in an impossibly compact steady state (say, a billion light-years across), we're still imagining the equivalent of  two days  of brain activity of a full-term human fetus.   But there may be an infinite number of universes, right? And out of that infinite number,  some  of them might have some kind of organization resembling a thought process, right? Well, that may be, but I hope you see that given their size and the restrictions of information theory, the most intelligent conceivable universe could scarcely have the brains of even a developmentally disabled [nematode]("
atheism,"You base your decisions on faith too.  You just trust the people who told you the world was round and they can scientifically prove it.  You haven't gone around proving every little piece of science that blew your way.   The problem isn't faith, in science, in what the schools teach you, in political positions . . . The problem is when people decide to use their faith, their views, their ideals to tear others down, or take from them.  Faith has NEVER been the real problem.  Treating people poorly, making things us vs. them has always been the issue.  Even when "science" purported that certain peoples were genetically disposed to being inferior, it wasn't faith in the speakers, but a lack of personal responsibility, accountability, consideration for others??  I'm sure there's a better term for what was missing.   It isn't faith, though faith is often the excuse used to claim destruction was okay.  The want to destroy was already there.  The lack of sympathy was already there.  Faith was used to cover it up, as it is used by the OP to avoid seeing the real problem and parsing a better solution.   It is never good to belittle or think little of others.  We are each stupid in our own special ways.  It is better to lend a friendly hand to help educate and introduce the truth.  Just remember, the OP is just perpetrating the very same issues they are railing against.  You don't stop war by warring. (You don't stop whore by whorring??).   And that's MY soap box."
atheism,"You shouldn't lose all respect for someone just because they're overly religious. A really good friend of mine is extremely religious, goes to church every sunday, etc.. I didn't know for the first 2 years I knew him. He always kept this to himself and never pressed his religious views on anyone. His view was this: "everybody sins in some way or another according to Christian beliefs. I mean... I sin all the god damn time so I can't judge anyone else for their sins." he also said he has his religion that he follows and never tries to push it on anyone because his parents always taught him that what other people believe is none of his business. This actually made me respect him more than before because he's able to be extremely religious in his own way and not how "the church" wants him to be."
atheism,"There is a whole world out there to teach them.  Racism and bigotry have been taught to kids for years and years, and we're slowly defeating that idea.  But at this point, they have to rebel against science before they learn to love it.   Second, I'm not saying you have faith in science and that's the same as faith in religion.  I'm saying you have faith in scientists and that's the same as faith in religious leaders.  Both have track records of good and bad deeds.  It is just that at this time, the bad deeds of the religious leaders have been blamed on the religion.  The bad deeds of the scientists have been blamed on the doers and the companies supporting them (not science).   If we treated religion like we do science (STOP thinking I'm saying religion is just like science.  I know you are), we'd blame the church, the pastors, the people involved AND the Pope would have to defend his church's protection of child abusers.   Instead, we have allowed religion to be considered "special".  It is tax exempt, and considered above reproach in many circles.  WE did this, not religion, and not science.  Don't blame the religion (which contradicts itself often enough to show you AREN'T supposed to take it literally).  Blame the selfish people who use it to create the very abuses you hate."
atheism,"That's the one thing that really kills me about some religious people (not all, by any means):  when they know less than you about their own supposed beliefs and the argument essentially turns into "Im right and dats it I dont need to no anything else because JEEZUS."  I also don't agree with that everything has to turn into an argument, but when someone is demonstrating intolerance of any kind, I generally feel the need to step in, because that's how I do."
atheism,"I've never actually been very religious, and as a 17 year old growing up in Illinois, I finally told my parents I wasn't a believer.   I had some complications at the public school I went to and was never really forced upon religion (with the exception of grandparents being religious). My parents sent me to a private Catholic school last year and I started questioning creationism and such, read the bible multiple times, researched a lot, and finally came to the conclusion that it was bogus.   To say the least, my parents took it well and we still talk about it, small debates on our beliefs really, and I may be changing them over unintentionally... They understand my arguments and sometimes agree with me, and it wasn't a painful process to come out at all."
atheism,"No. This isn't. [Horus was conceived by Isis and Osiris.]( with a zombie dick.... No one could find him, his mother gave birth to him in secret to protect him from Set...

atheism,"You guys do realize that giving people food doesn't magically cure poverty, right? I'm not saying bibles do, but it's not the answer. I live in Haiti, and it's actually pretty bad to just bring food, because the people here become dependent on people bringing them food and don't do anything for themselves. It's a real problem."
atheism,"Story time: In '07 I was chosen to be a part of a 7-person group to visit some missionaries we supported in South Africa. I was sixteen, brainwashed, and on fire for this trip. Total cost PER PERSON to go? $2,300. As a team, we held fundraisers, we spoke each and every Sunday and Wednesday at church to encourage people to give money toward this great cause and the great work that we were going to do. We basically told people that they were wrong and selfish if they didn't support the missions program.   So we get about a week out and everyone's got their money and we're getting ready to go. We get the final itinerary for our ten-day trip and while looking it over I started to notice something seemed a bit off, although I couldn't put my finger on it. We are meeting every day at this point to rehearse the skits and things we'll be doing while we're over there.   We get to SA and are picked up at the airport by the missionary, her "assistant" or "head pastor" in a big conversion van. We get to her place and let me tell you: it is nice. Not nice as in she's living like a queen or even maybe how we would think of really  nice  in America, but compared to these other people, her place is a palace. She's got running water, she's got tons of food, she's got extra space and tv and everything. Not too bad, I thought, this will be nice.   Throughout our ten days, we didn't  do  anything. We didn't bring food. We didn't build anything. We didn't provide medical care. We didn't hardly break a sweat. We ate like kings. We were always full. We drove thirty miles one day to go to the MALL. To SHOP. For OURSELVES. We ate burgers and fries and coleslaw from an overpriced restaurant with the extra  spending money  that we had brought from extra donations.   Let me tell you something about Tzaneen, South Africa, folks. There are poor people there. There are no poor people in America. Yeah, we have homeless, "hungry", etc. But there's always a place for shelter and resources for help. In many of the villages, there is one water well. That one water well gets water let to it from the city two times a week for two hours at a time. The entire village must share and collect as much water as they possibly can during this time for all of their drinking, bathing, etc.   There is no readily available food. Many steal just to provide anything for their families. When the girls are old enough (young teens) they start to prostitute themselves to put food on the table. The living conditions are terrible. Imagine a cubicle at a bank. Double that, throw in some dirt floors, shoddy, weathered wooden walls, thatched roof with holes all over the place, and throw in a family of five: eldest brother (19) who works all week in the city and is never at home. Next four range in age from 5-17. Both daughters prostitute themselves. There is no bed. There is no regular source of food. Both parents have died from AIDS. All of the children have AIDS from their mother.   Now imagine driving by in a van as big as their home, drinking water from a fucking bottle, complaining that it's too hot because the A/C is broken and you just happen to way 350 pounds (hellooooo, Pastor)! The motherfucking nerve. This is when I really started to notice things were off. Did we stop? Fuck, no. We saw one of the kids at service that night in their village, though. Of course we told them that God was great and provided for all of His children. Fuck that.   Another day we were door-to-door witnessing. My team of four took a small village at the top of a "mountain" (read, big hill). It was about a half an hour walk up to the top. I met a lady in her mid-forties, in a tattered green shirt, long skirt cached with dirt, and a leapord-print headdress. She was dirty, smelly, and looked a type of sad that I could never begin to understand. It was my turn to witness.   "Do you know about Jesus, miss? Do you know what a great and wonderful, kind and loving God I have come to tell you about?"... and it hit me like a hulk-fist to the stomach: What God is going to help this woman? What God is going to bring back the son that she hadn't seen or heard from in two weeks, who had been involved in the local gang activity? What God was going to provide her her next drink of water? No God was going to do these things for her....   I finished praying with her, because I didn't know what else to do. She accepted Christ, Hallelujah! Glory to His name! I felt... numb. We had been here for six days at this point and hadn't done a single real thing for anybody.   "Alright, cn2092, we're headed back down. We should get moving before it gets too hot!"   I couldn't move. Here I was, holding two bottles of water for the  terribly difficult  journey I had embarked upon. I was wearing my favorite hat to shield my face because, God forbid I get sunburn! As the others were walking away, I turned around and found that lady. I told her in my English, without the translator, to take these bottles and this hat, and to take care and that I would keep her in my prayers. To my shame, this is the only thing I  did  the entire ten days I was in Africa. It was the only thing  any  of us  did .   We spent all that money, all that time, all that energy, to go on a fucking church tour and tell some of the poorest, most downtrodden people on Earth what a great God we served. How He was the ultimate provider, healer, and comforter.   Before we left, I gave all of the clothes I had taken over except for what I was wearing home. I left the rest of my snacks and I bought as much water as I could with what spending money I had left.   A big part of me died over there. My faith did, for sure. My faith in people, my faith in the church, my faith in Christians, and my faith in God.   Not sure why I typed all this out. I know nobody will read it; way too long. But I guess I needed to get it out - at least some of it, anyway. So much more I could rant on about. My heart still breaks to think of all that money wasted. $16,000. We could have built dozens of homes, schools, etc. We could have built wells. We could have provided so many meals for so many people.   We did fucking nothing."
atheism,"The teachings of Islam do not entitle one to declare the teachings of Islam as law, or to establish their jurisdiction over neighborhoods.  A gay man should expect to walk through a Muslim neighborhood, unmolested, because there is nothing that the Muslims in this video can rightfully do to stop him.  Even them following and heckling him is technically harassment, and is criminal.   Your religious beliefs do not give you the right to dictate how other people should behave."
atheism,"Yes but all your doing is lowering your self to their level. You need to show you are better then that to get respect, why the hell do you think the protestant church is more lenient then it ever has been. Not because people constantly attack it and call it out but because both sides are being respectful to each other and that grants them the ability to talk and to ease up on some rules but before that can happen one said needs to show they are capable of stepping down and talking to the other. Thought I do understand their are two possible outcomes to stepping down one is they do to and the other is total destruction but in the world we now live in such a move would be far to hasty for the church to pull and would only destroy their creditability in the process  so really we would still win in that situation apart from obsessively heavily segmented groups that put way to much faith in to such ideas. Yes their are always going to be idiots that stoup religious bullshit but and satire and jokes are good to help get past such things but first we need to show we aren't their enemy otherwise we only build on their hate we need to show that we can extend the olive branch by just maybe saying:   "Hay I know some of your rules are outdated but without you none of awe modern rules and laws may never have gone in to place some admittedly bad but, most of which good and stuff the helped father humanity while still keeping control/peace (I know their have been allot of religious wars but allot of peace has also come of religion if you cant see that well then your blind and I'm sorry) in ways we just couldn't in the past so, I though that if maybe it would be nice if we stopped throwing shit at each other for no reason and had a talk about some of the rules that just don't work any more" sure you might just get a "FUCK OFF KID" and if you do record it put it on the internet get some karma for it and watch the media eat it up but you might also get something productive out of all this fighting which would be better then more segregation, where large towns become atheist and small ones become Christiana because then things just get worse and worse.   I don't expect you to agree with me here, I know it's hard but if we just keep fighting then we will do nothing but make the situation worse. I will go back to me last example the 1950-80 when black people first got real rights not imagine if instead of having MLK telling them to be respectful have him telling them to fight their white oppressors that would have made white people fear and hate them. Now that the situations and we are all traded equal now we can joke, we can have people make jokes and satire but for the time being we have a choose to make; we continue the cycle of hate or, we rise above it and brake it.   One last point never in the history of the world has a revolution been a good thing. Even your american revolution was in essence a bad thing at first anyway, it was a war to make the rich free and the poor slaves nothing more that's why you needed to be a white male landowner to vote back when the deluration was first signed and even then their could have easily been behests and fixings due to the was the system used to work and still does to today. The same goes for almost ever revelation that has ever happened so before you get that idea you can just throw that out."
atheism,"Ummmm she left the approval code, which can be traced back to the terminal, which can be traced back to OP. Good try. You are probably going to get fired if they see it."
atheism,"You seem to be marginalizing everyone that actually works hard for a good life.   Of course all people that do well for themselves have had some degree of luck. For example; the luck of having the capacity to develop talent, the luck of not being on the street during the formative years, the luck of having good parents, etc...   However, most of us have to work hard to get where we are. I was teaching myself computer programming at the age of 8, started with BAISC, was doing Turbo C by the time I was 9 or so. I was lucky to have access to the computer lab at the university where my mother was studying for her masters and later PHD. We weren't rich, she was a single mom in a country we moved to together (US.) We lived in student housing, first in a studio, then in a one bedroom. When she got her PHD and got her first postdoc work we moved to a town home. Shortly after she bought me my own computer, because my she saw how much I loved everything about it.   I would say by the age of 12 I already knew exactly which business I wanted to be in. Through high school I worked on a lot of projects which got other people's attention. Eventually that early work and learning brought me together with a lot of amazing people and I built connections. By the time I got to university those connections made it possible to join a start-up, move across the country and eventually do my own business ventures.   This brings me to the point of 'connections'. There is nothing wrong with connections as long as there is no nepotism. Knowing the right person because they respect what you do and your skills, is a great thing. Through the years I've befriended people that know many of the exact same people I know, but they can't get anywhere regardless. I remember years ago I had one tell me "I wish I had your connections", but wtf... he knew all the same people, just had nothing to bring to the table.   Sure some people get by on luck, politics, backstabbing and nepotism. Most of us hate those guys and we hate that people employ them. Just recently I was in a meeting with a company I do business with. There was one guy with them that is exactly like that, total coat tail riding bro. It was so hilarious at dinner after, when we were discussing all the cool shit we did in our childhood, after university/college, etc.. and he was like "oh yea I remember IRC, were you ever on dalnet?" Mind you we were discussing things ranging from BBS, to who ran which IRC networks, hacked what, and which major start-ups people wound up at afterwards... Yea, virtually no one likes that guy."
atheism,"No it's 10-15% if you're a normal person. Hell, you don't even really have to tip, especially if the service is bad. Tips are supposed to be a bonus for doing your job in a pleasing manner. If I'm doing well I'll tip super huge regardless of meal price, sometimes not at all with bad service or if I'm broke. If you have a huge party and order a bunch of shit and don't even leave a few bucks to a good server I mean your gonna look like an assbag to pretty much anyone omnipotent or not imo. Also, not paying them min. Wage is utter Norsedick.   Source: I've waited tables. A lot."
atheism,"Little known fact is that in most states, your employer only has to chip in to bring your wages up to minimum wage IF over the course of the pay period you make less. That's how I was literally paid less than my great great grandmother some days.   Oh and the no benefits part also means no sick pay or short term disability. Sick cooks, bartenders and servers handle your food every day. I don't care how many times you wash your hands, one food service worker with the flu will infect others. Many of my employees (once I was promoted) used to hide illness symptoms to avoid being sent home when money was tight."
atheism,"You can remove the word God and it still makes both people look bad.   You don't tip because you give all your money to charity? You're an asshole.   You do tip because you don't care about helping the homeless? You're an asshole.   Giving doesn't have to be about religion. It's about being a decent human being.   I don't understand why you guys can't take some of the good from the Bible (or any religious text) rather than disregard everything.   So now, giving what you can to a worthy cause is "religious bullshit".   Just because someone tithes doesn't make them a good person but people that don't give to charity but can...well, they're assholes.   Furthermore, in the original post, replace the word "God" with your charity of choice. What gives a server the right (yes, that is how servers treat tips these days, as an entitled right) to 15% - 25% when you only give a charity 10%?"
atheism,"This can be wrong on a multitude of levels.   To Go orders, in many cases, can require more work than waiting a table. People who operate the To Go desks are asked to do much more than "stick it in the bag."   People only form the opinion you have for one of two reasons: 1) They don't realize the work that many To Go people often do or 2) They're arrogant assholes who don't tip for the work that is done by the underpaid employee, they're tipping because the person made them feel like they were served. "I SEE the waiter serving me and it makes me FEEL good, so I'm willing to tip." Paying for the feeling of being waited on/served is not the same thing as paying for the service. If it were, people would tip To Go people more."
atheism,"Here's the basics: my view is that an underlying force/energy allows the universe's physical properties to exist and function.   If by this you mean we do not yet fully understand the strong and weak nuclear forces, electromagnetism, and gravity and how they unify in enough detail to create a Grand Unified Theory, then I'd agree with you. With the exception of gravity however, we do have an approximation of their interactions as described by perturbation theory, which partially describes how gauge bosons may be exchanged between particles. Unfortunately, there  are  things we don't know, or rather that this does not describe. Like bound states and solitons.   But what of it? Conjecture is not evidence. Nor is it descriptive, predictive, or particularly useful in any way in the observed nature of the universe.   >If a Deity exists or does not, it is unproven as of yet.   True.   >Atheists have a theory that one (or more) does not exist because nothing has been observed by people.   I can only speak for myself, but I have a  reasonable hypothesis  (not a theory) that it is  unlikely in the extreme  due to utter and complete lack of any evidence that would lead anyone to that conclusion. Just as I have a  reasonabe hypothesis  that it is  unlikely in the extreme  that flying pink unicorns from planet Biggledyboop hide my car keys in the couch cushions sometimes, due to the exact and precise same utter and complete lack of evidence for them.   >The flipside of this is that I see a universe with complexity and that is a good indication that something is beyond our senses is happening which led to the universe's state of previous, current, and future existence.   We all are already aware of many things that are happening beyond our senses. Fortunately, we have empirical information of those things that have led us to study, learn, and eventually devise instruments to detect some of this for us. There are many, many complex things we do not know yet. We continue to try and learn more.   >The atheist will argue that there is no need to bring a deity into discussion since it may have occurred on its own.   Correct.   There is no need. Occam's Razor is a rather large issue.   >But I am bothered why some are opposed to me saying that I believe a Deity did have a role. No 100% proof either way.   Because, quite simply, you create far more problems than you solve with such an outlandish proposition. First, why posit such a thing without any evidence whatsoever? Even more, why posit something without any evidence when instead of solving your problem, it  actually makes it far worse?   You now are left with more questions than you started with. Where did this deity come from? What are its properties? Why does it exist? How can we determine its existence? If we cannot, then why does it make any sense at all hypothesize such an entity? Something that has no measurable effect on anything is the same as something that doesn't exist in every way.   >My question is why so many are against me having my views when either reasoning carries similar weight. Nobody has proven anything.   Because if you believe hypothesizing unevidenced and unhelpful solutions that actually highly complicate an issue but solve nothing, predict nothing, and determine nothing can possibly  carry similar weight  then you have much to learn.   This illogical, unevidenced, unhelpful, contradictory, unexplained, non-predictive, non-measurable, non-specific and rather bizarre idea  cannot  carry any weight  whatsoever  to anybody actually interested in actually knowing."
atheism,"You can't be agnostic here is why:   Simple question do you know if there is an elephant in my kitchen? You couldn't know could you? So you will answer no I don't know. You might think that it is more probable that there isn't but that doesn't matter.   If I asked you if you believed there was an elephant in my kitchen you would have to say either yes or no you can't say you don't know because that is not the question it is the same with god.   You either have to say yes I believe there is a god or no I don't believe there is you can't say no I don't know what I believe."
atheism,"I hate to play the Devil's advocate here (wink wink) but couldn't one argue that the Supreme God of Hinduism, Vishnu, doesn't look like the others you described.  Vishnu is blue, the color of the sky.  I don't know any blue people.  Vishnu has 4 arms and at the end of each has a hand carrying items that signify peace, mediation, sustenance, and war. (I also don't know any 4 armed people.) The fact remains though, you are correct. Religion was a human invention, made to help man come to terms with how truly brief life is. Though I consider myself agnostic, religion has a place in this world, even if that is only to comfort those that can find comfort nowhere else. As much as I appreciate the views in r/atheism, the open-mindedness of our world is the true goal. The issue between the church and scientific studies is the search for knowledge. One group believes all knowledge necessary is predetermined (religion), where the other is constantly searching for more (science). Clearly my decision to remain agnostic shows that, although I believe the search for continued knowledge is necessary, I'm not entirely convinced there is no "higher being".   I forget where I first heard it but.... You can't prove the complete absence of a God any easier than a practicing christian can provide definitive proof that there is one.  If when I die, there is a Supreme being that judged my entire life, I'd prefer to stand tall and confidently state that I lived my life loving and respecting my fellow man. Even if my fellow man didn't extend me the same courtesy."
atheism,"Lets say your grandfather was a in the army.  Served some number of years and suffered from PTSD.  The two of you were very close.  To be clear, you have an emotional investment in your grandfather and his situation.   Lets say that he has been dead for a few years now and someone says that your grandfather was a coward.  They say he never joined the army and that he was full of shit.  That his service and pain wasn't real.   Now, you may be the paragon of reason and balance and you've achieved nirvana over 9000 times and you never get upset over anything ever.  But a normal person would take offense.  A normal person would be upset when they are told someone they were close to was a liar and a fraud.  Even if they are certain it isn't true.   It is the same situation for OP's aunt.  Christianity is probably a really big deal to her.  I wouldn't be surprised if she would describe it as one of the supporting pillars of her life.  Hell, she may even say that it is top 3 most important things in her life.  And, now this is the part that may surprise you, most christians like that aren't the "approach everything in a strictly logical and rational fashion" type.  In fact, quite the opposite is generally the case for people who base one of what they consider the most important facets of their life on faith.  Is it really surprising that a normal person would be upset if you basically insulted them?  Is it surprising at all that the type of person I described would be upset?"
atheism,"please explain how one converts to atheism? Some loud atheists might act like assholes....but atheism is NOT a belief system.

atheism,"To be fair, there are legitimate Naturopathic doctors out there. I actually know a girl who wants to become one. In the states where it's recognized, becoming a doctor of naturopathic medicine requires the same 4 years of medical school required by those who wish to become doctors of allopathic medicine. One of the main differences is that they do not need to complete a residency. Legitimate naturopathic doctors do have a good amount of medical knowledge at their disposal, but instead try alternative treatments for ailments that often can avoid side effects. With that being said, they also know there are many conditions that cannot be cured by these alternate treatments and will refer a patient to a doctor that practices allopathic or osteopathic medicine if a medical treatment is required."

atheism,"Simple. If God prevented every bad thing from happening, there could no longer be free will, or human achievement (as there is nothing to struggle against). We would, essentially, be what angels were believed to be in medieval times- immortal, morally perfect, singing God's praises, yet lacking the power to make decisions. In Christian apocrypha, this is exactly why Lucifer rebelled against God- he could not understand that God gave us freedom, yet denied it him."
atheism,"You guys are depressing. and ill briefly explain why.   I, for one, am not catholic, and i dont really care about what the pope says. but if he had said something anti-gay, everyone here would flip sh!t. when he says, now remember this guys word meets all edges of the earth, that atheists can be "good" people too, then lets think about it: is thats good publicity to atheists? NOOOO hes the pope, i hate the pope, lets be arrogant and not accept a complement by one of the most powerful people around.   geez. also quit bashing people with faith. youre just as bad as them if youre playing at their level. who cares about what other people believe, when it comes to that, you should mind yourself. really, if you care so much about how awful christianity or islam or hell even buddism, that you have to go out of your way to screenshot pics of facebook, then you have a problem. I joined this subreddit to see the difference between believing in something, and not. I have found more hate and sadness in r/atheism than i have ever on gore."
atheism,"Well there are definitely some lines in the sand here. Are you criticizing the religion, or are you criticizing the people who follow it?   For instance, if you say, "I think that the stated origin of Islam is potentially dubious, and I think that it is far more likely a reinterpretation of Judaism and Christianity that changed significantly through successive word of mouth retellings being recolored to fit the local cultures in which they were being told."   This kind of statement is likely to be pretty offensive to a Muslim, as well as some Christians and Jewish people, but it's in no way bigotry.   If you say, "Muslims believe in violence and the conquest or conversion of all non-Muslims" that statement is pure bigotry based on simple observation: Muslims are the second largest religious group in the world and if they collectively believed this we would be in a constant global conflict. Before someone says, "yeah, but they're growing quickly and they're just biding their time," I would like to remind everyone that a lot of people said very similar things about Jewish people (especially in Europe) for much of the first half of the last century. I'm not invoking Godwin's Law here either, anti-semitism was quite common before, after, and independently of the Nazis.   It is usually at this point that someone will point out that some Muslims DO believe this, and point to literature which reflects the "true" beliefs of Islam. The problem with that is you can pick apart literature from very nearly any religion and find examples of similar barbarity. Furthermore even members of religions whose literature place enormous emphasis on not harming others regardless of circumstances have had radical sects which have committed horrible acts of violence which they felt were justified by their religion. For instance, the current Buddhist-driven "969" movement in Burma, and the Sikh terror bombings in India in the 1980's.   The unpleasant fact of the matter is that there are some horrible people out there who are hell-bent on doing horrible things and it doesn't matter one damn bit what religion, race, or creed "drove" them to it. They had the capacity for it already."
atheism,"Anyone that is anti-theist, as far as I'm concerned, loses a least a little respect with me.  You are anti-theist.  No matter how much you go around being a dick trying to stroke your ego that you are on some higher level of intelligence and cannot fathom how anyone can be part of a religion, it  won't  change how that person thinks or feels.  "If you could reason with religious people, there wouldn't be religious people" - Have you heard that saying?  No matter how much you try to reason with them and call them idiot's for "having imaginary friends", it will not change their opinion.  Switch from being an anti-theist, and become an atheist.  Myself, as well as billions of others, would respect you a bit more."
atheism,"Once a really snappy, pushy lady came into the stamp store I worked at. We sold rubber stamps, especially custom stamps. An address stamp for   County  Pregnancy Clinic, was what had brought this woman in. A couple weeks back, I had been talking with a friend who recently went down to our state's capitol to sit down with reps and senators about the  County Pregnancy Clinic lying to their "patients." But see, they weren't patients. Because the "Clinic" is not medically accredited, and they won't encounter a single doctor in the building, only every shred of false evidence that the ONLY CHOICE is carrying the baby to term. Advertising pregnancy services in downtown  , a bus ride away from campus, closer than the nearest Planned Parenthood.   SO. This woman writes down clearly her name and address. I read it, slowly and loudly, for her: " __  County Pregancy  clinic ." Pause.  CLINIC.  I'm looking her dead in the forehead and her head rears up from her cellphone and she meets my eyes and says "Yes, Clinic," Harsh and fast because she detects my sass. The rest of the transaction was boring and I charged her a fair price, but DAMN did she suck."

atheism,"I went to a CPC when I thought I was pregnant because of the free testing/ultrasound. I ended up being pregnant, so they asked me to come back in a couple days to get an ultrasound. I came back, found out I was 8 weeks pregnant, so they asked if I'd stick around to speak with a counselor (my choice), and I said yes since I was pretty scared. They brought me into a room, and in the room was information for RU 486, child rearing, and other pamphlets on spousal abuse. The counselor came in and asked me a series of questions, and together we made a pro and con list. After a while, they brought in my boyfriend, and we all talked together. They have a list of doctors they give you, both OBGYNs and abortion clinic docs. Not once did I feel "guilted", I felt nothing but support from our counselor Pam. She even sat with us during the ultrasound and held the hand my boyfriend wasn't. The CPC I went to made sure to let you know right away on the information registration forms and their brochures that they had private funding and in no way had any government involvement, and you do sign a privacy statement. You don't even have to give them your real information if you don't want to. I think this place was a safe haven, and not the monster that SOME people are making these places out to be. They even offer coping classes if you choose abortion, parenting classes, daddy support, to-be-mom support, etc. Maybe the centers in Texas do things differently, since these are privately owned and ran. But please, do not look up CPCs and start picketing them, because I would gladly recommend this place to anyone in need."
atheism,"I had an IUD for years and I was constantly told I was aborting each month by pro-lifers. They do consider preventing implantation as abortion. Apparently I am going to hell because I aborted a fetus a month for about 5 years."
atheism,"I'm not sure if you're just looking for a reaction, or for me to back track, or what. This is what it comes down to, and it will be the last time I state it:   1) I PERSONALLY believe that abortion is the murder of a human being. Let's be honest, without a person intervening, there is greater than a 50% chance that it will be brought to term.   2) States recognize the rights of women to terminate a pregnancy. They have determined a period that they deem legal to have an abortion.   3) NONE OF THAT MATTERS when it comes to my views. I am not the woman having the abortion. I am also not the lawmakers that determine the cutoff dates.   4) I refuse to tell someone what they should or should not do. If you ask me, I'll tell you that I disagree with it. If you don't ask me, it's not my place to tell you. It's not my place to tell you you shouldn't have an abortion, or to try and make you feel guilty for having one."
atheism,"In my experience, religion rarely came up in the social settings. The other kids just didn't care--it wasn't important to them at all. And I swear, catholic school kids party and whatnot wayyyyy harder than public school kids. At the time I was neopagan/agnostic and always got in to theological discussions/debates with the religion teachers/priests and they always encouraged and indulged me. Most of the time I was arguing for women's rights within the Church. It's interesting too bc most of them agreed with me. You'll find that a lot of priests who are teachers are a lot more open minded than you think. All in all, personally I wouldn't trade in my Catholic school time for anything--some of the best and most fun years of my life, and I'm sure you'll do great :-)"
atheism,"Christian here, allow me to push back on this idea a bit. This argument shows up all the time. But I'm pretty sure atheists know perfectly well by now that Christians believe that God acts through worldly agents. God always uses things or people to accomplish His will: be it doctors, or thieves, rain, or fire, pretty much anything. It's a physical world and God will act upon it in... well, physical ways.   Christians who read the Bible will know that putting themselves in danger and then expecting a miracle to save them is called 'putting God to the test.' It's exactly what Satan tried to tempt Jesus to do."
atheism,"For me, I was not raised in a household where religion was an issue. I went to a private college that required 4 religion classes. I also took 2 philosophy classes and 40 credit hours of science classes. I wanted to believe in God. I work at church. I sought out answers, I went to 15 different churches searching for this truth, for this higher power... The more I inquired, the less sense anything made. I still feel this desire for more, but trying to fill it with God just didn't work. My brain can't justify it, even/especially after all I learned."
atheism,"Comforting the living.   How you choose to honor the dead is personal to you and should not be limited to the funeral.   The funeral is for the living, not the person that died.   Remember... death is hardest on the people left behind."
atheism,"Just because we don't know specifically what caused the big bang, doesn't mean god did it. There is still no proof of that happening.   But if you want to go all "history repeats itself" trial, you can do that. The farther back you go, the more god(s) were the causes of things. Prehistoric men felt the reason it rained was because god made it rain, instead of water vapor turning to clouds turing into rain. When people recovered from an illness such as a cold (back in the days they were fatal) it was god who made you better, instead of your anti-bodies. Look up the death of god theory. It's along these lines."
atheism,"I'm basically in the exact same situation as you are, except I'm 20. From what you describe, your parents seem a little less understanding than mine. I openly debate my parents with the flaws I see in their religion, and we have many meaningful conversations. I am an Atheist and my parents know that.   When it comes to traditions like synagogue or shabbat dinner, I don't really take part in them. It helps that I live away at university, however my parents understand and respect my beliefs. That being said, the respect has to go both ways. Remember what your parents have done for you, how much they love you, and what Judaism means to them. I know religion is a very touchy subject and both Atheists and Religious people alike get emotional. So put it into perspective. Do you really care about missing one day of school? You're 15 years old for god's sake (pun definitely intended), go to synagogue for an hour or two and then play some video games for the rest of the day. The new Splinter Cell is out and its unreal. Just try to keep in mind how important it is to your parents. They can't force you to believe what they believe, but practicing some of the traditions simply to make them happy is enough to show them you can have differing opinions but still have an amazing family dynamic.   Its a balancing act. Obviously if something makes you very uncomfortable then don't do it. At the same time try to keep your ego out of it and think of your parents. Tomorrow my mom is making a Rosh Hashanah lunch for my entire family. Cousins, Grandparents, the whole shebang. I live away so I wasn't planning on coming in to town, and when I told my mom this she was visibly hurt, but wouldn't tell me to stay. I walked in the door today and surprised her and she could not have been happier. I couldn't care less about the Jewish traditions that I'm going to have to sit through tomorrow, the smile on my mom's face today is worth it all."
atheism,"Sure about that? Never shamed for masturbating or led to believe that touching yourself made you a pervert? Never asked by an adult in a private setting if you masturbate or have seen pornography?   It's not an overt thing that people easily recognize, and some never recognize it at all. However, when an organization systematically shames you for having natural physical impulses and desires (especially during puberty when you SHOULD be exploring your newly changing body) and links those impulses to eternal damnation and separation from your family, it doesn't just cross the line of abuse; it long jumps over it.   It's fascinating to hear stories of still Mormons who feel shame and dirtiness after having sex with their spouses. THEY'RE MARRIED! That means sex is supposed to be sacred and beautiful, doesn't it? But after a lifetime of having chastity and sexual shaming shoved down your throat, it's hard not to get past those feelings.   On top of that, sexual dissatisfaction, especially for women, can be emotionally damaging, and if you're shamed out of masturbating, you'll be hard pressed to know how to satisfy yourself, much less explain to a partner how they can satisfy you.   And since I'm on woman-specific issues, women are taught from a young age that their worth lies in their choice to become a mother and dutiful wife. Their blessings come from marrying a priesthood-holding return missionary (and being married to a priesthood holder is the only way for women to get into the celestial kingdom, mind you). They encourage you to get a higher education at their own institution, wherein return missionaries (who've been under buddy system lock & key with other chaste and wholesome young men) are abundant. Law of chastity(young singles + hormones)=Abundance of young marriages with short courtships & engagements. Because that's a healthy way to choose a partner for life. The running joke is that women don't go to byu for an education, but to find a husband.   So perhaps you didn't feel directly abused. However, at the very least, the church abuses its power and influence over young people, convincing them that because they have primal, physical instincts (sexual desires and urges, etc), that they are inadequate in the eyes of "The Lord" and they need to church (to repent and pay tithes) to be good enough to keep their family (a child's whole world) forever.   It seems you got out of it relatively unscathed, which is great! Really. I'm happy for you. But do be careful not to discount the damage that it's done to other people."
atheism,"Truth' is one thing, interpretation of it, is another.  However, the truth remains constant.  Understanding it is what can be considered fluid.  I am not convinced all sciences are empirical, but they are all based on experimentation and logic.   Ahh, then if it is further clarification you are seeking, I can provide that.  But, you don't get to speak for me.  I can expand on most of the points I try to make.   An example of the destructive nature of religion?  Umm ... sure.  Let's start with the basics, like the Crusades or the Inquisition.  I'll even add in the Witch Trials and any and all jihads.  I blame the Dark Ages on religion, and the stifling of scientific progress in the "Civilized World".  On a more subtle note, I point out the exclusivity of religion, and how it defines humans into an "us", "we", "them" set of categories, and it usually turns out that if 'they' believe in a different invisible man than 'we' do, then they are less than human, and can be killed in a wide variety of ruthless manners.  Plus, we are also going to believe that they are going to burn for all of eternity in a fiery pit.  But, this god loves everyone ...  Approximately 100 billion humans have died in history.  I am going to make an (unsustainable) assumption that religion is going to be one of the leading causes, if we were to make a pie chart regarding cause of death.  From sacrifices to war, and not even getting to the fact that stem cell research should be decades ahead of where it is now.  Finally, and this is what I truly hate about religion, is that it is destructive to the mind.  If 97% of America's scientists are  not  religious, it is easy to see that the faithful aren't choosing careers that require that side of the brain.  Imagine if people who could quote scripture could do the same with tax law, or physics/chemistry/neurology, etc. (insert anything useful).  So, by that alone, they have chosen to fill their head with something that will  maybe  help their "eternal soul", but will most likely not actually help any living person, and definitely not anyone else.  Religion does not work well with logic, and therefore represses it.  ("
atheism,"you are born conditioned to believe what your parents tell you is true but that could be anything not necessarily religion like don't let snakes bite you or you'll die makes just as much sense as "the king can make the river flood" as to what is in the article (by the way the daily mail?) is talking about who ever wrote it clearly has not read the god delusion they so blithely poo-poo, this was in the the book, the idea that animism is good for an evolutionary standpoint is compelling, stop & think about why the rocks are sliding & you die but if you just assume they are out to get you & run you live it also means you tend to assume that if everything has a reason rather than a cause then everything has assumed design "the night is for stars"-my niece, the good thing is all this can be neatly circumvented by telling them why a thing happens instead of just that it does."
atheism,"my uncle (a fox news type conservative) was railing on about how climate change isn't real and all the scientists were lying; because reasons.

I spent the next half hour regretting having said anything."
atheism,"While I mostly agree with you, there is a line where that's not true, and it really is more about your use of the word science.  Science means what to you?  Would you consider string theory science?  String theory can be understood and not believed.  In fact, that's where a lot of scientists are with that issue.  Science, the procedure, the act of science, of exploration and hypothesis and testing and study, that is an act, not a belief.  The results that come from those tests are, to an extant, beliefs.  We believe that the laws of physics hold up all throughout the universe.  We believe that they have been the same since the beginning of time.  And we, much like the people putting the puzzle together, can make very educated guesses as to what the empty puzzle holes are, but we can't know until we find them.  We fills those holes in with beliefs.  We draw our own lines that make the most sense to try and complete the puzzle, and then we try to prove that those lines are correct by finding the puzzle piece somewhere hidden in the universe.  But really, we can't ever know, no matter how much we understand, exactly what was in that hole before we see what's in the hole.  Newton thought he had quite a bit figured out, he filed in his own holes as best he could with his beliefs, but he was wrong about a few of them.  The same can be said for every scientist (or any one person for that matter).  We do the best we can with the experiences we have, some of us just prefer to be more methodical in how we fill in our missing puzzle pieces and some of us prefer to rely on faith or feelings."
atheism,"I have my doubts that Fox, even Fox News, represents an authentic belief in cultural conservatism. Their high god is Mammon not Jesus or Yahweh or whoever. Murdoch and underlings saw an untapped market : angry, scared, under-educated conservatives, and so they designed a 'News' entity to cater to them, grow them, and reap the profit.   Why not air a show that will sell advertising time?  Worst that can happen, some of these cultural conservatives will see it, get angry and fearful and watch more Fox News to be comforted.   Win-Win for Fox."
atheism,"Okay, so by applying the law of parsimony we can -know- with more certainty that there are no gods because there are simpler, more likely explanations. Instead of believing there is no god because there is no evidence (agnostic atheism?), we can know there is no god because there is greater evidence for simpler models rendering god(s) unnecessary (gnostic atheism?).   And I definitely agree that there are no supernatural forces at work, but I might contest the unlikelihood of "imperceptible" beings. After all, we evolved to be sensitive to be specific forms of energy and matter; we cannot imagine how echolocation is experienced by dolphins or bats for example. Dark matter might be thought of as "imperceptible." Is it possible that because our senses our so limited, that even though technology expands our view of the universe, it too is limited in scope of the entire sensorium? ("
atheism,"I read some of the comments, but not all, so this may very well have been answered or viewed by you already. I think the part of the argument about the definition of the word "belief," and it's use, is fundamentally flawed here.   First, the various times I read the word "belief" it was proposed that it means "The acceptance that a statement is true." And, therefore, a belief that something isn't true, holds that there is a belief in the contrary opinion, and thus another belief.   The flaw is twofold (that is, two reasons that I can think of at the moment): (1) The word "belief" has more definitions than the one provided, (2) and the overall thought that there is only two sides to take in this argument is a false dilemma.   (1) Although partly a correct definition the first time, it can also mean "Trust, faith or confidence that a statement is true," "A feeling of being sure that something/someone exists or something exists," or "A state or habit of mind in which trust or confidence is placed in some person or thing" among many other different wordings...and thats just the english vernacular (What about other languages that don't even carry this word?). Point being, is that any one word has more than one way to put it or define it and, as such, belief can't be constricted to simply "The acceptance that a statement is true." Comparing the various definitions, I have faith (read: complete confidence) that gravity is real, rather than simply believing (read: a feeling of) it is real. Now, are these the same statements or does one seem more certain than the other, and thus something more than just a belief? Does that make the word "belief" too ambiguous? Depends on who you ask, but I believe the word "belief" is being restricted to one definition unnecessarily.   (2) You are absolutely correct in arguing that when someone takes the opposite stance, that of unbelief, they are simply saying that they believe the opposite to be true, belief, and thus creating a different type of belief. For some reason no one took this further, however, and I think it's ludicrous that it hasn't (again, I haven't read all the comments since there are close to 300 and I just don't have time). This is, quite simply, a false dilemma. Just because we can't conceivably come up with an alternative to our views on religion does not mean that an alternative doesn't exist (big. fat. fallacy.). What about indifference? What if believing or not believing lacks any sort of belief at all, both unbelief and belief? For this I cite the philosophy of existential nihilism as a prime example. Not only is religion not even considered as anything, but life itself lacks purpose and is utterly pointless. Does belief even factor into this person's thoughts who follow this philosophy or is does this person accept this philosophy as fact, thus eliminating any and all chances of belief in anything (non-belief as fact, not belief in unbelief)?"
atheism,"That's one of the best stories i have ever heard, mine's not as good, but here ya go:   I was about 5 or 6 and in year one of a church of England (cofe) infants school. As you can imagine, we had these big religious assemblies pretty much every day as part of the indoctrination process. During one of these assemblies, our head teacher convinced me that God was my dad ('God is the father'). I think you can see where this is going...   So i went home that night, and as my dad comes in from a hard day at work, pretty much the first thing i say to him is 'you're not my dad, god is'... As you can imagine, this got my non-religious parents... Well... A bit angry, so angry that they immediately phoned up my school and told them to stop filling my head with that shite, to paraphrase.   Now i am atheist, and in my final high school assembly, (this was at the point where i definitely knew i was atheist), i didn't say the word god in the song 'jubilate deo', and when our head teacher invited us to pray, i stayed sat down. Even when my friends sitting near me invited me to stand up, i simply said 'i don't believe in god'.   In hindsight, i should probably have chosen not to sit in the isle seat, as that made people notice (i even got a slightly disapproving glance from my headteacher, and i'm known for being a goody-goody-two shoes). Anyway, pretty much no one brought it up, surprisingly, the only significant time was at shirt signing when one of my history teachers jokingly questioned whether my not praying was an act of defiance. To this i simply replied: 'If everyone else wants to believe in their imaginary friend in the sky, they can go ahead, but i don't'."
atheism,"I grew up as a Pentecostal minister's son. The speaking in tongues, passing out, dancing.. I've seen it all. My favorite story goes like this.. Once during service, my dad was preaching and someone thought it would be a good idea to interrupt with a "message in tongues." First of all, if God wanted to deliver a message to us, why would he do it in unintelligible nonsense? Secondly, of all the shit this "God" character could be doing, like solving world hunger, bringing peace to third world countries, or just generally cheering people up, why was he trying to give church people a message via mindless prattle? Anyways, on with the story, so the guy spits out all his nonsense and, as is customary in Pentecostal churches, everyone waits for someone to "interpret it". So we're all sitting there in silence when a man stands up and says "The lord is saying to us.... THE DEVIL IS A PUNK!""
atheism,"I can't believe you are the only one in this thread saying this. Whilst I agree that there should be equality and people should be able to represent their religious beliefs freely.

So I got on my soapbox to reply, but when I hit submit he had already deleted it. I spent a while typing it so I'm pasting my response to him here. Hope he sees it:   You're absolutely right, it will never work. Exactly like any other nation that has tried single-party rule (WWII Axis countries, USSR, North Korea). It is a terrible idea to impose one political stance on any country's population.   America is currently a two-party state. You're either Republican or Democrat. Conservative or Liberal. Left or right or wrong.   Unfortunately, no matter what your personal political views are, as an American voter you are stuck picking one side or the other. Moderate conservatives have to vote for whichever nutjob made it past the primaries, and Democrats who may not support big government are still going to vote Democrat. There is no middle ground at the state or federal levels.   Instead of insulting third parties, we should be encouraging them. America is the most diverse country in the world, yet the people only get to choose between two options. If there were more than two parties to choose from, better legislation would be passed.   The legislators are supposed to represent the people, but instead they're influenced by corporate lobbyists, not the voters. The only way to fix this is by either banning lobbyists, or getting rid of elections altogether and instead of having elections, choose the congress similar to how trial jurors are chosen: randomly appointing qualified citizens to serve as the community's voice.   There's no way that will happen.   What could happen realistically is that young people could pay more attention to politics and actually fucking vote. The demographic with the highest turnout in Election Day is the elderly. The old, white, religious elderly. If 20somethings voted like seniors, major issues of today would be addressed quicker.   Third (and fourth and fifth...) parties are our country's best chance to actually becoming progressive. But they need help. Think for yourself, question ALL leadership (think about what kind of people seek political power of any kind, mostly egocentric), but don't dismiss libertarianism, communism, socialism, environmentalism, etc. as worthless. We only get to be on the earth for so long, we should all have our voices heard equally while we're here.   If you're a die hard republican or democrat, quit complaining so much about the other side of the aisle. That's exactly what they want. Instead, do some research. Look up your parties and candidates stances on issues that matter to you. Issues that you want to have a fucking say in for once. Organize new parties that better represent you and your communities. Be heard."
atheism,"This paper  and lower relapse rate over both 3-year and 16-year periods. It does not demonstrate, however, that AA is more or less effective than any other treatment option.   There is on the other hand  evidence  in an attempt to discourage relapse, despite mountains of evidence that shaming and guilt can  cause  relapse.   In additional, prayer and divine revelation are actually part of the [12 steps]( you cannot complete them without it. If you don't get your spiritual experience at step 11, it's assumed you never really handed your problem over to God in the first place, and so you're not "working the program". It's a hit to the self-esteem at a minimum, and that can lead to relapse. This is exceedingly dangerous for those whose alcoholism is a result of more deep-seated problems like schizophrenia or severe depression.   There was (and according to some claims, still is) a tendency for AA members to encourage each other to abandon medications, family and even marriages in order to pursue the 12-step programs. These are not official policies of AA, but the problem was severe and widespread enough for the national AA organization to publish a pamphlet telling members to keep taking their medications. While this is not any sort of evidence of malfeasance, it does add to the body of evidence that AA is not based in any way on the actual science of addition recovery.   If you're looking for actual reality-based methods for treating alcoholism or other additictions, you could do a lot worse than  start here.  combined with individual and group therapy sessions. Social activity and group therapies are the only behaviors positively correlated with lower relapse rates. The successes of AA treatment, such as there are, are almost certainly down to the regular meetings rather than the 12 steps themselves."
atheism,"What difference does the label make?  Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, etc?  Everyone makes up their own version of what they think god is and what's important to him.  You can barely even find two alleged Christians who believe and practice the same way.  Catholics use birth control or don't, accept homosexuals or don't, blow up abortion clinics or don't.  All a label does is roughly lump groups together, but what good does it do to say "Islam is good" or "Islam is bad" when anyone can simply make up their own version of Islam, just like they can make up their own version of any religion.   In the end, if you believe that you're carrying out the wishes of a divine creator who will reward you for your actions after death, you're dangerous.  Not necessarily because the doctrine you follow is dangerous on its face, but because you don't make decisions rationally, and yet you believe those decisions will decide your eternal fate.  If you have no objective standards on which to base your morals and actions, then they're always open to carrying you wherever you or someone who influences your view of god would like them to go, and appeals to logic and reason are completely meaningless.  And a book like the Bible, Torah or Quran isn't an objective standard because everyone just interprets them however they'd like, as is clear with everyone who labels their particular beliefs with a tag like Islam and then behaves completely differently from other people who label themselves the same way.   It's not "Islam" that's the problem, since there are millions of good hearted, caring Muslims (who would no doubt be good people even without religion).  It's the idea that it's ok, even virtuous, to believe in irrational ideas and then act on them like your eternal salvation depended on it."
atheism,"Having Christian teachers doesn't mean anything. You can still be objective about other religions.  In the UK, Religious Studies/Education (RE or RS in different schools) is compulsory in state schools when education is compulsory (up to 16).  The school I was in had the school priest and his wife as part of the RS department, and they were some of the most objective teachers on religion.  Being religious doesn't mean you're anti other religions.  You just use the line "Christians believe..." "Muslims believe"."
atheism,"the unfortunate reality about donating leftover food to homeless shelters is related to the reason that some grocery stores, especially in NYC, lock their dumpsters so no one can "dumpster dive".   as with most precedents set in the US, it only took one homeless person to sue a grocery store, and that possibility of kindness dried right up."
atheism,"I wasn't thinking about the effects on the moral compass of normal people. I was thinking about bad apologetic arguments like "morality needs divinity", which normal religious people are taught by the clergy after skeptics ask for justification of their beliefs. Normal religious people can feel why it is wrong to act amoral (maybe they need an incentive to act moral). A psychopathic person doesn't feel it and has only punishment as reason to refrain from amoral behavior.   I think that originally, before Christianity was an established religion, people were attracted to it because it demanded the observance of moral rules, the validity of which were self-evident and a big advancement compared to the barbarism of the Roman empire. There was no need to define morals, there only was a need to oblige to moral rules everybody agreed upon. So first come morals, then comes religion, then comes clergy, then come skeptics, then comes apologetics. Normal people use these bad arguments not because they are psychopaths but because they are part of a system in which bad arguments are spread by psychopathic authorities. Normal cult members are not the psychopathic ones. They are the uncritical ones who are grateful for any argument that helps to quickly overcome their cognitive dissonance without having to face the brutal reality of giving up the cult."
atheism,"I'm 18 and an Atheist. This is my last year living with my super religious parents before I leave for college. Every Sunday morning, my father, brother, and I organize the parking lot at our local church, much to my disdain. Being Easter, we were expecting an excess of "twice-a-year" Christians dressed up all nice for their biannual dose of Jesus juice. As I was setting up the orange cones in the far corner of the parking lot, I found this little guy, cold, wet, and shivering, staring up at me from a muddy puddle. He tried to fly away, but only managed to hit the concrete even harder. I spent the next two hours in the church's laundry room with a bucket, towels, and a blow dryer, scared that his wing was broken and he wouldn't make it. When my father came in looking for me, he said "We don't have time for this today. There are more important things to do", I said "No. No there isn't." By the end of the second service, I was standing in the woods nearby with "Bandit" perched on my arm. A few minutes after I took this picture he jumped vertically into the air and took off above the trees. When I walked back to church, the second service had already ended and a few of the people I showed this photo to told me that "Jesus was grateful for what I did." In my heart, I know that the life of one small Waxtail is worth so much more than the gratitude of a mythical Jewish carpenter.   If you don't feel like this post belongs on this subreddit, then that's fine. I just felt like there needed to be one more anecdotal Easter story with a happy ending."
atheism,"Culture is irrelevant. If a  Muslim  stones a woman, and stoning is  condoned  in the  Quran , I have  every  right to blame the religion.

atheism,"The Christian bible says all sorts of bs about stoning women to death for various offensives. The reason most Christians disobey these directives is because their culture has changed.   As an atheist I believe all religion to be evil. What do you think attacking Muslims is going to accomplish? It's just going to make them believe that all Westerners are intolerant. Attacking their faith is about as successful as attacking a Christian's faith. You're much better off to try and change it more subtly. eg.

atheism,"mock]( >1. An imitation, usually with the connotation that it's one of lesser quality.   I'm not sure you intended the word mock this way, but I'm not sure there is really any other way you could intend it. I'll forget about the connotation of lower quality and assume you are just ridiculing them.   Mockery or ridicule is basically asserting your correctness with a superiority complex. Someone who isn't emotionally invested in being superior would simply politely tell the other person that they are incorrect and explain their reasoning. There is absolutely no reason to be rude (for that's exactly what mockery is) other than to inflate your own ego.   And don't even try to rationalize this by saying "well they are rude to us;" that is the same "eye-for-an-eye" archaic morality that atheists claim to condemn.   A parallel might be how one talks to women. It isn't intolerant to recognize the fact that women are overall physically weaker than men, but if you mocked every woman you saw for being weak you would be called an intolerant asshole."
atheism,"I'm sorry, you might be under the illusion that we give a fuck about your delusions here.  Change "pray for death" to whatever you want, it still doesn't make a sliver of a difference to the outcome.  That's why you're backtracking prayer now to the realm of ephemeral things, "guidance in your life." It's fucking convenient for you that nothing like that can be tested, isn't it?"

atheism,"This comes as no surprise to me; this past summer, I was enrolled in an international language school in Spain and one of my classmates was a 23-year old Saudi, the son of an oil elite. That guy loved to dance, and told me exactly about these kind of events. As he described them to me, he and maybe a group of a couple dozen friends would go outside of Riyadh to a secluded house where they could party- just dance and have a good time. He's a devout Muslim who abstains from alcohol, but like cigarettes, so he and his other friends would risk torture, extortion, jail time, and of course family shame just so they could dance a bit.   It really changes how you think of dancing; something so indispensable to one's culture could be taboo in another.   The guy also raises, owns, and bets on horses, in addition to being as horny as any young man in a repressed-Islamic nation would be.   /cool story, bro"
atheism,"No no it doesnt. It has to do that there are a bunch of horny sexually repressed people out there who have authority and are willing to wield it on the vulnerable. People are not going around quoting the bible as the fuck the shit out of little kids.   Also atheism provides no age of consent framework either, by its very nature of being a non belief."
atheism,"My family was very mild Catholic, we are not religious at all anymore.  My parents, I suspect, made us go to church for a while "for our own good" as it was very popular in the community I grew up in.  After the kids were grown, nobody gave a shit about it anymore.  I can't even imagine us being religious during Christmas, that would ruin the whole thing.  I live in a large city in the midwest.  Most of my friends are either engineers, IT professionals, musicians, or artists.  I like to talk about my strict atheist views.  Nobody gives a damn about religion.  Thank you God."
atheism,"I disagree with your notion(among other things) in your blog that religions have good qualities. Fuck their good qualities if they MAYBE have them. Its not a reasonable tradeoff IMO that you ignore that it is a lie they are spreading, all the while enslaving minds and bogging down our societies potential. As far as being an asshole, yeah as an atheist (I personally am an atheist) I am disgusted by religions & their history of autrocities I am not willing to forgive those historical action documented in their holy books. Seems though you are willing to pretend that somehow that has changed.. google "Eygpt church bombing". It the same old same old. I emplore you to stop making excuses for the deplorable."
atheism,"What usually ends up happening is that most people have two levels of belief.     You go to all temples, and since people these days have very less time, temples are turning into multiplexes. Lots of smaller temples, and whenever people find the time on quiet evening, they can go to a 4-5 temples one after the other, each of them dedicated to another god.     However, there is usually one god that every individual has a special affinity for. My dad for example, is crazy about [Lord Venkateshwara, also called Balaji]( who is headquartered in Tirumala Hills.       I grew up with an adoration of the god, Balaji. However, when I started growing disillusioned with organized religion, it was easier for me to stop going to multiplexed temples, but a thousand times more difficult to detach myself from Balaji. It was similar to the disillusionment you face when you have been let down by a parent."
atheism,"I was aboard a cruiser headed for Viet Nam back in '66.  Someone came around and asked each of us what religion should be stamped on our dog tags.  There was a list of acceptable responses.  One of the guys told the person asking, "None!".  He was told, in no uncertain terms that he  had  to choose one.  In desperation (not wanting to get written up) he selected Buddhist and moved on.  He was a DJ on the ships radio and yukked it up pretty good telling the entire ships crew that since he couldn't select "none" that he was now the resident Buddhist."

atheism,"Just as ignorance is a gift, faith is a gift too, I'd say. Same thing actually.   Not being able to care about the intricate workings of the world around one is a blessing. A mixed one, for sure, but it definitely makes ones life easier.   Life is more carefree and basically nicer and less frustrating if one accepts everything on the basis of "devine plan" and "because God did it", rather than having to think about complicated scientific stuff like physics, math, geology and so on.   Also, having an unmoving religious source of "knowledge" removes the need for continuous education, as the sciencentific pool of knowledge keeps on growing on a almost daily basis. Grab yourself a bible or a qur'an and your knowledge is always up to date, as it has been for about 2000 years after all."
atheism,"Your wife is going to be the child's mother. She has at least as much say in it's religious education as you do. It's more important to teach your children critical thinking skills than to make sure they don't join a religion. If your kid does join a religion it won't, I suspect, make any difference in how you feel about him/her or your wife. You're still a family.     I find sex education to be analogous to the issue of religious education. If you tell them religion is bad and try to keep them ignorant about it... you're just making them more vulnerable to it.     Teach him or her about the foundations of religions and expose them to as many different faiths as you can. Of course expose them to secular traditions of philosophy, science, rhetoric, and freethought as well.     That way, when they're exposed to religion, they'll be able to make informed decisions and use the proper protection."
atheism,"I had an ex who's family was from the midwest.  Their oldest son met a girl in Georgia and they planned to get married.  Both families were overwhelmingly Christian.  My gf's family planned for a wedding and bought tickets to fly down.  The minister in Georgia wanted the brother to jump through some more hoops so he called off the wedding.  Too late to get a refund on the tickets the gf's family decided to fly down anyway.  An aunt sold me her ticket so I went as well.   I was a closeted atheist.  I had no idea how bad the gf's family was, let alone how bad southern baptist could me.  The entire week was a passive aggressive showdown.  Saying grace at Denny's or ihop became a competitive sport.  Each time got louder, more thankful, more bibliscous.   Game night.  Gf's family was over at the other family's home to play trivial pursuit.  There was an exception, you could challenge any of the 'stupid questions that nobody would ever know' and try and name a bible quote that the other side picked out.   There were some obscure passages in the bible - then there are the people that can find those from memory.  Also, there are so many translations that going to the bible only causes more arguments.  I could answer the science questions, but we won because I knew Superman's fathers name was Zor-el."
atheism,"Compare and contrast to the Triangle, where amongst the < 35 demographic the response is usually pretty "eh".  In Chapel Hill, at least, I really haven't noticed much of a response either way.

atheism,"The point is that even if they want to see their dead loved ones again its not okay to take it out on atheists. Saying what's the point in this condones the idea that atheists deserve to be seen as less because the religious can't handle the idea that there is no afterlife.   We don't deserve that. It's not okay to continue to let people do that. And why equate all atheists to that analogy? Not only are not all of us like that, but the act of saying "there is no afterlife and this is the only life you or your loved ones have" as your analogy suggests is not an act which deserves the punishment of being the frowned upon people that we are."
atheism,"Agreed with you 100%. Those in the service industry know 20% is actually standard now. Also note, the difference between 20 and 15 to you is maybe two or three dollars, but to the server it adds up and makes a hell of a difference. Plus, 20% is so much easier to calculate."
atheism,"My parents were raised Christian. Dad was given the traditional Italian Catholic upbringing in the 50's, meaning that the sermons were done largely [if not completely] in Latin.  He said he practiced until they abandoned this part of the sermon. He's also a nuclear engineer, so those two aren't really compatible with each other. Mom, on the other had, was raised Christian Scientist, but stopped practicing because she felt that God killed and took her mother too early. Additionally, she has no college education. They never really took any of us [there are four siblings in my family] to church during our younger years and never included any religious practices in our daily activities with the exception of Easter and Christmas.  It was always an option for us to explore it on our own free will, but they never forced it upon us. In retrospect, I believe they felt that growing up in the south after moving from Massachusetts provided us enough Jebus exposure to make an opinion."
atheism,"Mom is loosely-theist/spiritual, dabbled in things like psychics and tarots and ghost stories. Her parents were Church of England and Methodist.   Dad is loosely christian from an uneducated Southern Baptist family. He's less and less christian every time we talk, though, so happy to report there's genuine progress being made there.   I grew up with virtually no religious influence from either of them, though my dad did sometimes answer curious-kid questions with "goddunnit"s. "God" was an idea I was aware of because of the culture around me and on TV, so I did grow up figuring that there was some guy up in the clouds named God (much the same way I figured that there were people in suits called republicors and democracies whose jobs consisted of talking boringly to each other all day).   Middle school I realized that I was uncomfortable with friends' religious families because I didn't know what they were talking about. Saying grace at a friend's house was the first really awkward experience I had, and it weirded me out. Saw a crucifix at another friend's house and got REALLY weirded out. Started seeing religion/christianity as something to recoil from. My parents backed me up, expressing their distaste of organized religion.   Late middle/ early high school I started claiming typical dumb kid stuff- "I'm wiccan and dark" and that sort of bullshit just to seem mysterious and different. Middle of high school I realized how dumb that was, and just rolled with "spiritual but not religious."   College, freshman year. Started with the SBNR, ended up with crazy (though sweet) jesus freak roommate who, through many long hours of discussion, led me to realize there truly wasn't an ounce of that stuff I could accept. Sophomore year philosophy and anthropology courses opened my eyes to how much is out there and how many other people have thought about this stuff before. I decided to narrow down what I actually did believe in.   By the end of college, I was atheist. A couple years afterwards, and thanks to acquiring a few like-minded friends and discovering /r/atheism, I made it official and "came out.""
atheism,"Valid points even though I do not take the arguments from authority (Quoting the founding fathers and what not) as per se points. I think both our opinions do not differ that far in the religion/atheism debate as such but my issue here was not to point out that we need adress these things but that Darwinism and evolution theory belongs into /r/science and not into /r/atheism.   Just like the theories about gravity do not belong here, even though: >Newton was also highly religious. [source](   I understand the importance that it plays but you still failed to give a convincing argument why Darwinism belongs into the atheism section as it is not related to faith. You can be a believer and still approve evolution theory.   Also: Sorry for the late reply, I did not have a lot of spare time lately"
atheism,"I find it hard to rationalize abortion without reaching the conclusion that animals share many of the traits we consider human and therefore should have some form of protection and basic rights, depending on the species.   Bear with me here. Abortion can't be rationalized without discussing the exact qualities a fetus lacks and a person has that disqualifies/qualifies them for legal rights. Most, if not all of the discussion hinges around consciousness and intelligence. Many higher mammals are conscious to one degree or another.  And tasty as bacon is, I find it hard to rationalize the consumption of pot-bellied pigs, which frequently exhibit mental and emotional qualities exceeding those of dogs.   Simply put, for purely cultural reasons we are conditioned to eat animals that easily exhibit all the qualities of a pet.  How is reconsidering our cultural conditioning on the basis of solid observations and existing moral reasoning any different from breaking free from culturally conditioned religious nonsense?   See where this is going?"
atheism,"There is some really good literature out there right now, being done by non believers and recovering believers. When you get to that level you don't have to worry much about the confirmation bias set unless you go to a "religious" university. Since you have an MA though why not just go for a PhD? what schools are you looking at? I did a religion minor during my undergrad, most of the profs were awesome, you get a couple that make you go wtf? but the good thing is that you get to speak out and make them look dumb for saying outlandish shit."
atheism,"Teenager, yes. Angsty, pimple-faced, and garden-variety, no (are garden teenagers like garden gnomes, but more annoying?).   Look at history. Then look at America. Now look at me. Do I seem ridiculous now?   America was built on class divisions, came to economic power through slavery, took land through genocide, and acquired political power through war. It then spent the Industrial Age exploiting immigrants and giving customers disease in the name of profit. After that, it joined WWI and WWII in self-defense, waiting until it was directly attacked before it did anything. In between those two wars, the economy collapsed because of an irresponsible, hedonistic populace. Then the Cold War started, and the propaganda and lies that were spread in the 50s are still around today, 60 or so years later, still causing problems in international relations (remember Pakistan? Yeah, that was partially the fault of the US). The Vietnam and Korean wars were fought out of those irrational fears and propaganda, resulting in many pointless losses of life on both sides. Then the Gulf War (which motivated 9/11, yes, really, Osama said so himself), and after 9/11, more wars in countries that were Arab or supposedly held nuclear weapons or some other excuse (spoiler alert: oil). And now using lobbyists, corporations can gain tons of power over government (see: all the stupid shit that benefits large corporations and nobody else).   Now, tell me, what is in that list that should I be proud of? Hmm?"
atheism,"Speaking for myself, I was raised Roman Catholic. Every Saturday, I went to religious education. Every Sunday, I went to church. I tried my very hardest to be a good little Catholic. I tried to believe in God. I read scripture and prayed at night. I believed what my mother told me Pops was most likely an atheist. He died before I could ask, which actually brought me to question God. Why would he take a 14-year-old boy's father be taken by a gracious God? Later, my best friend died of cancer at age 16. My sadness turned to anger, my anger to hatred, and, thankfully, my hatred to gradual introspection. I searched my conscience. Did I ever actually believe? Now that I was no longer an angst-ridden teenager, I had the clarity of mind to compare what the church told me with evolution and the Big Bang. My youthful studies did not hold up to my adult research. So as not to be unfair, I went back with an adult (and open) mind to look for proof of religion. I found none. The truth of the cosmos has given my life the "beauty" that religion had claimed could only come from God."
Helldivers,"If you want to focus efforts, just go after the bugs, then the cyborgs, then the illuminate.   That's the order they became available and they're even listed in the on-ship encyclopedia in the same order, so that's the logical progression to take them out. Anyone sensible enough to realize that efforts need to be focused, should be sensible enough to notice that pattern, which is the closest thing to an "official" priority list.   As more people get closer too unlocking all the stratagems, you'll probably see more focus, as less people will be distracted by going to other systems to score better gear."

In fact, even the description of a power user is totally different between digg and reddit.   For one, power users in Digg became power users because of the friending system.

This is reality, where pretty much everyone is going to have some kind of opinion on whether or not the person they're dating was born with the anatomy of the gender they identify with. If you're going to label every such person as being hateful, then good luck finding a partner, because your dating pool just got infinitely smaller.   Just because a dude doesn't want to date a woman with a penis, it doesn't make him a transphobe.

You could mod over 600 subs if you spent the time making over 600, it wouldn't take that long if you had a friend helping. Would they be popular right when you make them? No, that is where actual work comes in. Sometimes you make the subreddit into a success, but more often than not...it ends up as a dead subreddit that just sits on your userpage as one of your subreddits.   3) People invite others that they know to mod subreddits because they know them well and know that they are a good mod and know the ins-and-outs of how to make a subreddit successful. On this site there are really good mods, decent/above average mods, meh mods, and then downright terrible ones. The ones that are really good or decent/above average get random mod invites sent to their inbox all the time.   4) Making subreddits at  for fun because you like to circlejerk and make silly subreddits as jokes that last for less than a day and then never get touched again.   5) Now let's talk if these "600+" subreddits are "active" (you would have to define active in whatever way you want here). Each subreddit has a team that moderates differently; some use the /new queue, some use the unmoderated queue, some make sure that mods are watching the /comments feed, some ONLY are comment moderators and don't have any other mod "permissions" like moderator mail, then there are jobs like designing CSS...configuring bots (the last two are jobs that a lot of people add mods to ONLY handle because they are so important/rare to find in a mod, I know of a mod that is a moderator of 4 default subreddits only because he is a CSS expert/designer for those subreddits), and things of that nature. What if all 600+ of these hypothetical subreddits had 0 subscribers and were just joke subreddits? That completely would invalidate your entire argument. There's more! Some of these subreddits could have completely lax rules, so a lot of moderation isn't even required in the first place, even if it is a large subreddit. How is that for a curve ball?   6) When you have active moderator teams that work cohesively, you are able to moderate a larger amount of subreddits, the workload for say "50" subreddits is extremely tiny because everyone is doing their fair share of the work in order to contribute and help out to get things done.   7) What about networks of subreddits like The Safe For Work Porn Network, The Imaginary Network, or the few others? They consist of over 100 subreddits but act as one subreddit since each has a different focus, but the same rules. They also have the same moderators because it is just one subreddit, spread out across a lot of subreddits because of their specific topic/focus. It basically comes down to this, a) Are the subreddits joke subreddits, or serious subreddits? b) If they are serious subreddits, which ones are active and which ones aren't active? c) How effectively/actively are they moderated (if high, this means low workload since the work is spread out among many other moderators for that subreddit even though it may have something like 5 million or more subscribers!). the"

rva,"Biking to work is the BEST!   Looks like many people have already covered the basics, but I'll add a few things that help me:   -Keep work clothes at work, if you can. I've only forgotten my work pants a couple times in 3 years of bike commuting, but both of those times I was  very  thankful for having a spare change in my drawer. If you are in an office building, blazers or sweaters are also GREAT to keep on the back of your desk chair in case you forget a shirt. Everything looks business-y in a blazer!     Keep toiletries at work. My partner doesn't have a shower at work, so he keeps a wash cloth and some deoderant at work just in case. Baby wipes are probably useful, too.     This isn't intended to scare you, but take your lane (ride toward the middle of the lane). It's the safest place to be. I know that it seems counter-intuitive, but if you are riding farther in the middle of the lane, cars will pass you safely and you'll feel great. If you are hugging parked cars off to the shoulder, you are going to get doored. Also, if you are hugging the shoulder, drivers will try to  squeeze  around you even if there is an oncoming car instead of waiting until nothing is coming. By biking toward the righ-center, you are making the decision easy for them by saying "if you don't pass me safely,  you  will have to be the one that risks getting hit (by the oncoming car). I've had many friends get doored, and thank god there was no car coming behind them or they would have bounced directly into traffic. Once I started taking my lane, I felt much more confident and safe riding."

OnePiece,"I don't think it's because of of grey storytelling verses black and white. It's mostly because of at the time that the anime internet community blew up, people had just finishing watching Dragonball Z, and stuff like Cowboy Bebop, and wanted more battle series that were dark and violent.   One Piece seemed anything but that. It's artwork (probably the biggest factor tbh as stupid as it sounds) was anything but serious or dark. It was super goofy, and not all that "good." Comics like Naruto and Bleach though? Way different they had artwork more in line with stuff like Dragonball Z and Cowboy Bebop, and although they had their humor, they started with a more serious tone.   One Piece characters were a lot more ridiculous and silly looking as well for instance. Luffy himself, Zoro using three swords, Coby, Helmeppo, Buggy's whole crew, Usopp, Kuro's crew, etc. One Piece also didn't really grip me until the Arlong arc where we got good crew character development, and the first villain that involved more than just terrorizing the island of the week.   One Piece also didn't kill anyone outside of a few characters in flashbacks, where as Naruto and bleach had characters dying."
OnePiece,"I think you are 100 % right about crocodile. However, who says Ace needs oxygen to create fire? This guy has a good point:   [鈥揮spadingo 30 poeng 6 dager siden   Actually, I think Ace wouldn't necessarily need oxygen in order to burn. And let me try to explain why.   Logia fruits allow a person to turn into their element, in seemingly infinite volumes. Take Akainu for example, he never ran out of lava.   If you look at Smoker, he doesn't exactly follow the typical conventions of science. There's no fire that produces the smoke, his body produces it. Let's think of combustion as the conversion of oxygen -> fire. If Smoker's case isn't a fire -> smoke process, why should Ace's be an oxygen -> fire process?   Of course, having the oxygen around would make Ace more powerful because he would ignite the oxygen and create fire that isn't made up of his own body."

h1z1,"Theres some confusion on the timeline, some people are saying that its no longer 15 years after but only a few years after.   Regardless of that, lets take an event where say...90% of the population of the United States dies from a virus, so that leaves about 30 million people spread out across the entirety of the continent, which means that there will actually be more weapons than people in the scenario we're looking at.   The United States has a whopping total of 89 guns per 100 residents, and that was seven years ago, it may be slightly higher now. So....wipe out 90% of the population, which removes a ton of competition for the weapons that are available and suddenly you have  A guns per capita ratio of 1000 guns to a person left alive or more.   So the whole idea of weapons and ammo being "rare as fuck" is ridiculous...because its not as if weapons evaporate, and its not as if dead people will have any need of them...and the amount of guns in a country doesn't suddenly become less simply because its 15 years after some kind of massive biological catastrophe.

audiophile,"I am a live sound engineer and audio systems technician, and I routinely set up hi-fi sound reinforcement systems (funktion-one, void, danley sound labs, eaw, etc etc.) for various applications ranging from corporate meetings to live bands to electronic music 'raves', and these are my experiences:   1) for most home systems and headphones, most people wont notice the difference between a 192khz mp3 and a WAV.  Most of the compression happens to the bass frequencies and only becomes apparent when you have transducers dedicated to the reproduction of those frequency ranges.  All too often, a DJ will play a series of wav tracks, followed by a mediocre mp3, and its really a difference you can FEEL more than hear.  Its the difference between the bass just being there, and the bass being 'warm' and 'round'.   2) if you were born before 1985, chances are you like the sound of vinyl more than any digital source.  It all depends on what you grew up with, and what your brain is contitioned to appreciate. With respect to dj's, lets get over the vinyl pure-ism.  IF you take excellent care of your records, IF you have played them less than 50 times, IF you always use your own quality needles (of the same shape), and IF you managed to get a good pressing to begin with, then maybe your vinyl records will sound comparable to the same track as a wav on a cd... Then you have the problem that a needle is essentially a microphone, so unless you are playing your records from an accoustically isolated room, everything from the pounding bassline to the crowd screaming will be fed back thru the needle to the pa.   I understand that most of the comments in this thread are related to home/personal audiophile systems, but I am commenting from my perspective as an engineer for public events, where accoustical treatments are out of the question, and volumes routinely reach over 105db A (120 DB C).   /2cents"
audiophile,"IMO, the idea of a "perfect reproduction" is just one aspect of appreciating recorded music.  But people focus on it way too much, when it comes to A/B testing of different degrees of compression and what you could call the "just noticeable difference" between them.   What's interesting to me about A/B testing is that there is a range where listeners can tell that there is a difference between different degrees of compression, without being able to say which file was compressed more or less.  The fact that listeners can't indicate which is which is interpreted as meaning that they won't care one way or another.   But that's not true.  For purely non-technical reasons, people care quite a lot.  E.g., in the world of painting, it's possible to create a reproduction of an art work that fools almost all people.  The majority wouldn't even be able to say that the two paintings placed side by side were different in any way.  But people who love art would obviously prefer to see the original than a reproduction -- just because it's the original painting.  The music recording, like the painting, is a cultural artifact.  Art and music lovers want to get as close to the cultural artifact as they can.  More complex in the case of music is the fact that we can view multiple objects as being the artifact -- in some cases, we view a live performance as the real, original cultural product, in others the song or composition, in yet others the musical group or orchestra's "characteristic" performance of a composition, and in others the recording itself.   Furthermore, people's auditory processing capabilities obviously are plastic.  If there is a range where we can notice a difference without verbally identifying which file is compressed more or less, then that is the area where learning takes place.  To train someone (or ourselves) to hear more meaningful details in the uncompressed recording, we could start with the A/B listening test and pick the version that comprises the "higher end" of the just noticeable difference, to listen to and train on.  Then after many repetitions, we would repeat the A/B test to find the next "just noticeable difference" that ought to develop from this process.  That would be one way of training auditory processing.   Finally, what you would most expect from many hours of intense music listening is the development of connections between the brain's auditory processing modules, emotion processing modules, and probably space/position processing modules.  The only reason to develop left-brain capacities in conjunction with music is musical training, audio engineering training, etc.  Being able to put a word on an amount of compression just from listening is a skill that probably has no purpose.  I.e., it wouldn't surprise me if you could practice the A/B listening test and get better and better at it.  But why would someone do that?"
audiophile,"to make matters worse I live in new zealand, So I have to also buy a step down transformer to even get the thing running without blowing it up. An expensive investment :/)   Note for anyone else ordering the O2 or O2+ODAC: When you order from Epiphany Acoustics, they will supply a power supply with the correct voltage for your country.  This means that you can get away with a travel adapter instead of buying an entirely new PSU for it.   > -If I used a 3.5 to 3.5 cable to connect the O2 to my ONBOARD SOUND, wouldnt I be distorting (over amplifying?) my music? Is that how onboard sound works?   If you have the O2+ODAC, there is no good reason to do this, as you will not be utilizing the ODAC, which you have paid for.   In terms of distortion: The signal is going to be no better than the quality of your soundcard, but the O2 will provide enough power to drive difficult headphones, and may still sound massively better than the headphone jack on your PC due to driving the headphones properly."
audiophile,"I'm a bit of a storage nut, and have designed medium size enterprise storage solutions.   I  personally  don't trust the cloud, so I store local and backup.   I'm currently using a 8 drive RAID-6, backed up to an LTO6 tape.   The tape has an incremental backup every week, and a full backup every six months (a copy of which goes in a safe deposit box).   RAID (not 0) or some other redundancy is pretty necessary for storage these days.   On a HW level, hard drives are  large , but not particularly reliable by themselves.   When not powered on, they have a data retention of between 3 and 5 years.   You  could  get more, but I wouldn't count on it.   HDD  also  have a "Non-Recoverable Read Error Rate" of somewhere around 1 bit in 10^14 (most drives) to 1 in 10^16 (really expensive enterprise SAS/FC drives).   That  sounds  like a lot... but let's run some numbers:   1TB is 10^12 bytes, or 0.8x10^13 bits.   Our Non-Recoverable Read Error Rate is 1x10^14  bits   Ten full reads of the drive is 0.8x10^14 bits.   This means that with ten full reads of a 1TB drive, you are 80% likely to at least loose a bit of data.  (it's not  quite  this simple, I'm lying a bit for simplicity.   It's actually higher, all things considered).   Probably with audio, video, or image information, this won't be very noticeable, unless you get unlucky and it's an important bit, like in a header or directory table, but hey, we are audiophiles, and we want  good  perfect quality, right?   With a RAID type system, the likelihood of TWO bit errors happening on different drives at the  same  location is astronomically small, like 1 in 10^50.  Note that this is  much  less likely than a bit error on both drives, as to lose information we have to have a bit error on both drives  in the same location .   If, and only if, this happens on a raid system, will your data corrupted due to this issue.   Another point on HDDs is that (aside from Non-Recoverable Read Errors and a power off shelf life of 3-5 years) is that the can fail in many, many other ways: a head crash, a motor burning out, a circuit failure, etc.   RAID will also help with this.   In  every  RAID setup (aside from 0), you can have at  least  one drive fail before you lose any information.   Although RAID helps greatly, it is  not  a substitute for backup.   On this front, LTO tapes are the gold (if expensive) standard.   With LTO6, tapes hold around 2.5TB of FLAC or compressed information, or a max of 6TB for compressible data.   They read and write at over 100MB per second, and have a shelf life of  15 to 30 years .   Another option would be M-Disc Blu-ray, with a claimed shelf life of 50-100 years... but while the drive is cheap, enough 25GB media to have a backup or 2 is insanely expensive.   Speaking of backups, it's usually considered "good practice" to make two sets of every  complete  backup, and keep one off-site in a bank vault or at a friend's house.   This helps eliminate the possibility of data loss due to catastrophic events like fire, earthquake, Godzilla, or theft.   To be safe, offline backup media should have a "refresh protocol" to help eliminate bitrot and future incompatibilities.   For LTO6 media, I plan to migrate all my relevant backups to a different tape/media/whatever is the solution at the time when LTO9 comes out (LTO is compatible for 2 generation previous), or around 10 years (well within the shelf life of my tapes)   OK: Now on to cloud availability:   I  personally  run my own.   Right now I'm using JRiver Media Center, but I'm looking at other options.   The way  I  see it is that if I spend the time (really not that much) to have reliable storage and backup, why bother trusting a fickle company?  I'm sure (most) of their engineers are using a system at  least  as good as mine (hell, they'd better... I designed a few), but that doesn't mean the company doesn't suck.   I've ran across a few that do crappy things like oversell their storage or bandwidth (business decision, not technical), or suddenly start charging an arm and a leg (again, business, not technical, decision)."
collegehockey,"To be fair, that is a fate that each of our schools chose by leaving the WCHA and CCHA.   The pairwise uses schedule strength, and the strength of schedule for opponents in rankings, it isn't a subjective judgement like the polls are. Western Michigan has the same conference record as Vermont, but Vermont has played many more ranked opponents going 6-11-2 against ranked, while Western has gone 3-5-2 against ranked opponents. The NCHC has been awful for the most part outside of the conference, and that is a big reason why only 3 teams are ranked. NCHC teams need to play better to be ranked higher.   Edit:  To further support that the NCHC needs to step up non-conference play to be more relevant (crunching numbers from USCHO), as a conference (meaning all teams in the conference), the NCHC has had about a 53% winning percentage outside of their conference, while Hockey East has had a 66% winning percentage outside of theirs. To put this in perspective, the Big Ten has a 60% winning percentage outside of their conference.   To be fair as well, most other conferences play a lot more outside of their conference than the NCHC has this season."
learnart,"1) Dry time. (2) Layers. (3) The right brush. (3.5) A few tricks.   Watercoloring's a bitch. A fun bitch, but a bitch. It takes a lot of practice before you can really strike a balance between letting the paint dry enough that it won't turn to mud and keeping it wet enough to blend. Practice, practice, practice - I'll admit I have huge issues with this still, drives me a wee bit crazy. I try to control watercolors too much. [My most-successful-but-still-not-that-successful watercolor]( - some dry brushing, some wet-on-wet. The color variation was wet-on-wet blending, the "layers" of the onion were done by layering thin coats of paint while letting it dry completely in between. The lines on the skin were basically dry brushed.   Anywho. Although my hand is too tight, that same principle still applies to looser works like those examples you posted. They're not working with all colors at once. In "this guy" I'm guessing the blues-purples were applied separately from the greens. Certain areas like the nose have too much definition between the colors for them to have been applied simultaneously. Most likely, they did one layer and then let it dry before applying the next. However, multiple layers were definitely at work. That's how they got some really crisp and dark areas. Set down your initial colors and block out what you want where and then keep adding layers. Be patient - if you WANT certain colors to blend, you add them while the other's still wet. If you DON'T, then WAIT. Let it dry. I'm also going to guess that the head was done in separate layers from the neck - the line around the chin is pretty defined.   I'd advocate that you start experimenting with layers and see where that gets you. :) Remember, be patient, let it dry when appropriate.   As for artificially crisp lines like that cityscape - that involves a little craftiness. A lot of those buildings were done with a wide, flat brush which can create some nice lines (if the brush is kept nice). However, there are some places where you want to put down a wash and can't maintain those pretty lines because the water just wants to go everywhere - in those cases you can either use tape or a resist technique. Most artist masking tapes will work pretty well (obviously test it on a scrap paper before to make sure it doesn't stick). Lay down the tape on the area you want to keep dry/white, paint where you want, and remove the tape when it's dry. There are also various ways to "resist" the paint - masking fluid is my go-to. Available at any art store, comes in a little bottle. It has instructions with it but"

Planetside,"I didnt play Planetside 1, but that doesnt make my opinions any less valid, heres my opinion on some of the stuff you said, even if you dont agree, treat it as food for thought. And sorry for the length.   I think that the crosshair problem is just poor implementation of a good idea. I cant stand the idea of CoD style play where it comes down to whoever has the fastest mouse movement, and just running around the map. I like the idea that after moving around your aim is crappy but moving the crosshair will just disoirientate players. I think that the way it should work is just an increase in bullet spread for half a second or so. The spread would be larger or smaller based on the size of the weapon, whether you are turning or running and could be reduced or completely removed in the case of light assault classes with certs. Light assault classes should use light weapons and be able to move around freely while firing them. Heavier classes however should have to stop and look down their sights to be able to get any accuracy, of-course the upside of this is that their weapons do far more damage.   The ironsights issue i think is again poor implementation of a good idea. The idea of having to look down the sight of the gun to be able to hit something is a good one, but your accuracy without it shouldnt be god awful. Additionally, using ironsight should be the norm, it shouldnt be thought of as a massive hassle. If a light assault class is running around with a pistol or light automatic rifle or similar they should be able to switch between sight and no sight quickly, as well as move at maybe 75% speed while sighted. A heavier class would take longer to sight, not by much, and move slower while sighted. The idea behind all this being that the tactic would be to run/sprint to a position, and then look down your sights to start killing people, instead of running around and pew pewing away as if you have laser vision. But again, increased non-scope accuracy for light classes.   As far as movement speed goes, they should either remove the endless sprint option or make a stamina bar. Additionally after sprinting your sights should take longer to use, and your accuracy should be of. If they do implement a stamina bar, the lower your stamina bar, the less accurate you should be. Again all of this would have a lesser effect on light classes. As far as MAX suits are concerned, i think it would be a cool idea to have them able to sprint faster than normal infantry, but to do so would mean you are completely unable to shoot accurately (think your screen bouncing up and down) and have a 1-2 second slow down time.   In my opinion the end goal for balancing infantry should be that a light class can out maneuver a heavy class, but a heavy class can outgun a light class. It should be a matter of skill that decides who wins a 1v1, and yes, sneaking up behind someone is a skill. I think that the go-to response when you are being shot from behind shouldnt be turn around and shoot back, it should be get the fuck out of there, find a good position and then shoot back.  At the end of the day i believe that a good fps battle should come down to positioning, the use of cover, flanking maneuvers and the like, rather than who has the better reaction time when everyones just running around out in the open.   Again this is just my opinion, i have not played planetside 1 and do not know enough about planetside 2 to definitively say what they should and shouldnt do, but from what i have seen the devs main concern is balance. They have their money machine in the visual modifications, they can devote their time and programming powers to balance and when this game finally comes out it will be balanced and fun. From what I have seen the developers have listened closely to fans, as they seem to be doing everything right, that Hi-Rez with Tribes: Ascend has got devastatingly wrong."
Planetside,"Nice sob story and all, but really stop hacking and you wont get banned. It's that simple. Look it's not like a CS rep logged into a the game, saw <n> reports on you and hit the ban button. They logged into a spook account, and watched you. They maybe even baited you with a few spooks that you couldn't hit unless you were using tools. When I got a new computer my k:d fucking skyrocketed because of the change from 5fps to 60fps. I'm  positive  I had people report me after a particular lucky string when attacking a biolab, and many other scenarios. Many other people in TEST and other large outfits have users with similar stories: why aren't they banned? Because they don't fucking hack. Don't hack and you don't get banned. It's that simple.   They wont tell you why you were banned, they won't tell you when they found out, it could have been the first 5 minutes of your hacking. SOE and SCEA's stance on hackers is "fuck em", but they sure as hell gather evidence on their end."
Planetside,"It's pretty obvious you've never played on a triple-screen rig before. Those side screens rarely get looked at directly. That would be very impractical. The screens get used as peripheral vision. It's a minor advantage paid for in framerate. I have a dual 680 SLI rig (I hear the game isn't using SLI yet, either) and playing this game in 3x screen does affect my framerates. This easily negates any advantage it gives me.   Really, this is more about immersion. Triple-screen makes the action on the screen feel more present because it fills your entire field of view.   I suspect you're just going to tell me I want to cheat, too. Were you calling widescreen monitors 'hacks' 5+ years ago? Is TrackIR a 'hack'? High resolution mouse? 7.1 positional surround sound?

Planetside,"Just because some people in the community decided to appropriate the word for their use in a context-understandable manner doesn't mean they're actually doing something useful with it (not in terms of advancing any argument at least).   When someone brings up "synergy" and "holistic approaches" in a discussion I will be very inclined to knee them in the groin and exit conversation because, even though I can clearly understand the meaning behind those phrases they rarely ever add anything worthwhile to the discussion.   Metagame is becoming PS2's pet word for "something cool that isn't what I'm bored with already" and, if followed by actual content, it usually is an explanation of what the poster is actually talking about (WDS points? resource revamp? continent locking?), going on to show just how much of a buzzword it is and how it might as well not be there.   Incidentally, if those same people that toss around their "metagame = more objectives" definition cared for the "outside-of-game information" meaning, discussions would move along smoothly, instead of being derailed every time by their armchair game developer boner craving to use the cool words with no regard for the context set in the particular exchange."
Planetside,"This game is entirely run by the players. While one fight is a lot of fun, another might be a meat-grinder where you'll die 10+ times in a row (even great players will struggle). Keep this in mind.   You really have to work for everything in this game. In terms of getting certs (currency for unlocking equipment), but I'm mainly talking about playing the game. If you want to feel like a badass then you have to be one. If you want to make an impact on the fight then you have to go make it happen.   A lot of games will try as hard as they can to make you feel like you're doing something awesome. In Planetside 2 it is entirely up to you, but it is way more enjoyable and rewarding because of it."

Planetside,"Did you consider if you go on nerfing the A2G ability of ESFs, there is literally no reason to play ESF?   Killing infantry is not a job.  Everyone and every thing kills infantry as a trivial portion of some more useful function.  Infantry kills infantry.  Liberators kill infantry.  HE tanks kill infantry.   In any fight of any reasonable size,  no single AI source  is capable of killing infantry quickly enough for that to become a viable job  except  for infantry and  that  is only because infantry exist in the exact same space and jockey for the exact same scraps of terrain.  Even as infantry the primary job is not killing infantry - the job of infantry is to seize key terrain (flipping points in other words).   By contrast, killing  vehicles  is something infantry are not universally adept at and while vehicle drivers may beg to differ they tend to ignore the fact that even when operating in hostile environments they can still deliver several times the KDR as a tanker than a grunt.  Sure, infantry can hold a line against any sort of vehicle given enough bodies - that just goes to show why killing infantry is a fairly pointless endeavor.  ESFs, however, are pretty good at killing vehicles.  Their non-AI nose guns do fair damage to vehicles and they even have a weapon designed for quickly delivering a hard hit before breaking contact - the Hornet.  Sure, if they want to personally get the kill they may need to linger for longer than is prudent but this is of no real consequence given that in the sort of hostile environment that would serve to deny any sort of lengthy A2G sortie the odds of any particular vehicle or soldier killing any other particular vehicle or soldier is slim."

autorepair,"Just changed some pads recently and they were so wore out that they had wore the rotor. The rotor had been ground so thin (on one side of the vents) that it looked like a blade from a meat slicing machine. The disc part of the rotor also broke off of the hub.   I honestly have no idea how the guy was even braking at this point. Then I found out later on that there was virtually no brake fluid in the master cylinder.   So after we got all that fixed up for him, the line on the rear-right blew and he had the nerve to blame us for it. Note that he told us he purchased the car at least four years ago and this was the first time he was changing his brakes (and possibly the first time any maintenance had been done on it)."

space,"I don't have any more experience than being an enthusiastic amateur. I wanted to recapture, in part, the thrill of the Heinlein books I grew up with like  Have Spacesuit, Will Travel  and  Tunnel in the Sky  which made engineering and physics sexy.   When I started reading about [Copenhagen Suborbitals]( I got super psyched because they make it seem possible. I drastically telescoped the time frame to make things more dramatic, but I based a lot of it on their tests and the possibly erroneous conclusion that what's holding them back from LEO are safety considerations, a whole lot of good laws, and the size of their launch vehicles. If you could strap their Tycho Brache spacecraft to a really, really huge set of hybrid rockets, and you had unlimited man power, deep pockets, and a core of people who had no consideration for their personal safety, would LEO be attainable? For the purposes of this book, I decided "Yes."   I grew up in South Carolina (where this book is set) and spent a lot of time with some older guys who would build boats, surfboards, bombs, rebuild cars, and all that kind of thing and so I grew up thinking that if you had the right tools, and enough commitment, you could do anything from scratch."
space,"The  apparent  size - which is a function of size and distance, so you're partly right - absolutely  does  matter.   There is light coming from the edges of the sun's disc, just as there is from the centre. That light, even when the sun is half blocked, is still illuminating the Earth's surface somwhat.   If the sun was just a single very bright light bulb, at the same distance (effectively a point-source), the moon moving across the sky would obscure it instantaneously - causing crisp shadows - there would be practically no "peeking around".   Thus, no penumbra."

I'm gonna have to get a bit woah-dude here, but it's fucking amazing that by being facetious pricks, we can actually manage to turn what is a humorous interpretation of a tragic yet ultimately trivial accident, into a genuinely inspiring story. It's only by mocking this situation that we can turn it into something with deeper meaning. That's pretty cool."
space,"You're confusing "absence of air" and "absence of gravity". They are two unrelated conditions that both exist in outer space - an absence of air, or more precisely, absence of atmospheric pressure means there's neither any oxygen for a human being to breath, nor any pressure exerted on us by the surrounding gases, while an absence of gravity simply means there's no object exerting any (discernable) gravitational force on you.   Since we're designed for life on this planet, at heights where a constant air pressure is always present, the absence of such could/would be fatal for us. Imagine a balloon filled with air where you're holding the nozzle closed with your hands - the rubber membrane is exerting pressure onto the air inside, holding it in check. Would you release the nozzle, there's now a new way for the air inside to release its pressure, and out the balloon it would stream. I'm sure you've heard of the dramatization of your head exploding in outer space without any protective suit - that same principle applies here (although I seem to recall that the effects wouldn't actually be that dramatic, albeit still fatal).   The reason he felt the salive on his tongue starting to bubble is related to the boiling point of liquids being dependent on the surrounding air pressure - no air pressure means the water reaches its boiling point at room temperature, so that's what happened there. The absence of air pressure could also explain his falling back so suddenly, more rapidly than we're used to seeing people fall down - there was simply nothing in the way to slow down his fall, where there's usually air around us dampening the fall ever so slightly. (Although I'm not sure the absence of air would actually have that noticeable of an effect. Maybe it was just a discrepancy between the video recording and playback speeds, seeing as the video technology at that time wasn't quite as refined as today's yet.)   For him to be able to float, he would have to escape the earth's field of gravity - a feat that's rather hard to accomplish without actually going to outer space. I believe the closest you can come is to use the ostensible weightlessness of free falling - there are planes offering a service where you can experience that sensation for around 30 seconds, if you have the money."

With regular contact with earth becoming more difficult and slow the further afield you go keeping everyone active would be an enormous feat, you could end up with hostility among the crew out of boredom and just any number of issues with morale   > it's size would be a danger during transit of any asteroid or icebelt you encounter on its journey,   with the size of the biome, you're essentially asking for trouble if you run into a rogue rock at the wrong speed   > you would require a power generator capable of running for over a century to keep the whole craft warm against the extremity of space a few billion miles from the sun   but this is within reason given OP's original concept that the technology is in place, it's just what's required for a few thousand, would be significantly higher than what would be required for an inactive crew, or in my concept, an embryonic crew.   i think it's fair to say, that in tens of decades, designer babies could well be a done thing, i believe morality will shift from todays fear of doctors "playing god" to "failure to optimize the life of your child" i think if you present parents the choice that their child will grow up "immune from 95% of all disease, and with a stronger heart/bones, better hearing and vision, and the ability to learn quicker" i believe that even in todays society, a lot of parents would agree to that, provided it was trialled and tested, and i believe that it's an attainable scientific goal that i can see happening within the concept of the story, so i took my version a little further into the future, for storytelling."
space,"Our technology in how it regards to the speed at which we can travel in space has hardly changed. We have developed better faster rockets but they are still rockets. In order for a trip to another solar system to be less than a few lifetimes we have to move beyond the scope of rockets and fuel and into the realm of wormholes and moving beyond the apparent laws of physics.   Even getting close to the speed of light would require technologies that are nothing like anything we've seen. If we somehow built a rocket with enough fuel to travel that fast it would still have to slow down. Carrying enough fuel to do this requires an exponential more amount of fuel to get to that speed. When you do the math you quickly run out of fuel on our planet. Then you run out of available fuel in our solar system, and then the universe. The time it takes to mine fuel, that would make the wait worth it, could very well take longer than a few generations.   My point is that there are ridiculous leaps in our knowledge of physics and the universe needed in order to travel fast enough to catch up to a generation ship. Waiting for a better technology to be developed doesn't make much sense. If we launched a ship capable of getting there today, in two hundred years, we may have only cut travel time in half. I really doubt we could cut time enough to actually pass the ship unless we had a spontaneous breakthrough in faster than light travel.   There may be a way to predict our technological advancement in regards to rockets and current technologies but there isn't a good way to predict when we will have a breakthrough allowing us to travel faster than the speed of light."
space,"OP proposes a means of traveling to another planet that while technologically fantastical is at least scientifically feasible. "Much faster" than a couple of generations is scientific fantasy.   //Don't quote Arthur C. Clarke at me, Einstein wins for the exact same reasons as above. A "fast" ship that somehow is able to serve as a contained, sustainable ecosystem for the humans inside would still take a looooooong each another planet outside this system, but is at least technologically conceivable in the predictable future. Once you start talking about traveling faster than the speed of light we might as well start discussing light sabers, the Force, etc. FTL travel does not rest on the same technological curve as anything else involved in a journey through space, and cracking that upper limit will not be the same as it was for the sound barrier."

space,"Different density materials have different speeds of sound. The same is true in different density air flows. Shockwaves are formed in the supersonic flow leaving a nozzle. Those shockwaves propagate out until they find the cooler, denser air of the surrounding flow. The shockwaves see that cooler air as a bit of a wall, and some of the energy is reflected back. When its reflected back towards the center that shock will cause big pressure gradients the closer it gets towards the center of the nozzle flow. That heats the gas up and makes it a bit brighter. Thats a shock diamond. The shock wave will do this alternating reflection and compression a number of times, 10ish, But each time it will have a little less energy, so the diamonds get smaller and more central to the flow."
space,"No matter what you say to me. I will never believe a person when they say "i can comprehend this scale"...   No matter how many pictures I've seen, videos of scale I've watched, just comparisons between our own little planets...   It's just impossible to fathom the scale in which the universe measures.   You look at yourself right now. Most likely sitting in a room. In that room you are still to some degree a small area of the room. That room is probably a small, or even large area of that building. That building is a tiny, tiny area of the city you live in. That city is truly tiny on the scale of the country you're in. Then that country in of itself pretty small on scale of this planet.   Now to me at least, I find it hard to even imagine my size compared to this planet (which I do waaay to much).   Now sure, if you use something like the planets in our solar system, the moons they have. Yes, you can put them up beside our moon and get some  understanding of how small we are.   (Let me just add something in here) You look at the moon at night and think to some relative degree that it is close.. But it's really not. You can fit every planet in our system between us and the moon... Just try picture that after looking at a few scales.   But if you try to tell me you understand how big the Horsehead Nebula is or how big our galaxy is... I just can't believe you."
BMW,"Here's my advice on exhaust system purchasing.     Make sure you listen to an actual car with the system you are considering. Recordings online can be incredibly deceptive. The way a system sounds with a $10 microphone 6 inches from the tail pipe on YouTube may be vastly different than in real life.  If at all possible drive/ride in the car as well. What sounds awesome on start up in a parking lot, might annoy the hell out of you cruising down a quiet interstate at 75mph. The high RPM range on a lot of systems sounds like swarm of weedwhacker wielding bees is chasing you. With a convertible, this is probably even more important if you ever put the top down.     Its your car, your money, so get what you like and tell the world to STFU. That being said, mods only for the sake of appearance, sounds, lights, etc. is almost the textbook definition of rice. So don't be surprised if you get some grief about your decision especially from track car type guys.     Also, nothing annoys neighbors more than the guy with the loud VRRRROOMAPBABAAAAAA car driving thru the neighbor hood, it just comes across as dickish and teenager like. So if that's not your general attitude, you might think twice about turning a nice understated BMW into a race car."
BMW,"Maintenance cost is all relative. If you compare two high end cars with an equivalent amount of things to break on either car, then maintenance should be similar. However, BMW parts are severely marked up relative to a lot of japanese parts. Let me give you an example.   O2 sensors for the E36 3 Series (92 to 99) were made by NTK (japanese company), sold to Bosch (German company) and then sold to BMW -> AND THEN sold to you at the parts counter. That is 3 markups. I have an O2 sensor in front of me now. It is stamped with NTK, Bosch and BMW. Things like that make BMW parts really expensive. This little guy goes for 400+ at your dealer but only 110~ on Pelican Parts.   Your oil changes are expensive. Big engine + synthetic = expensive. Any old car tends to be more expensive to maintain partially because normal things stop working (ie e-brakes) due to rust. And when shops try to wrench the bolts off of your car but have them round out because they're rusted in, they charge more for labour since it takes them a long time to get everything out."

This method only works in this order:     Define a target market (I chose wall st)     Gather or buy only qualified leads in this market (I'll explain how you can evaluate later. Only buy ppls direct numbers. Main lines are a waste of time)     Define your script. (Keep it short.  Goal of these cold calls is not to sell a product but to schedule a 15 min follow up call/webinar.  You should be on and off the phone in 2 min maximum. Pitch delivered and time booked.)     This is a numbers game so get used to rejection.  If you have a fear of rejection or 'call reluctance' just keep plugging away.  You will become a master at this and a pretty good negotiator.

I was receiving 30% of every case I dragged in, while my mentor took home 70%.   Under the guise of starting my own business, I was not learning the art of selling financial services, but being churned for a profit by someone else.   The strange part is I work as financial planner at another firm now, for the top producer in the country.  (He gets 100% of his leads from referrals.)  I hate working for someone else.

finance,"As an actuary, I can verify that it is a complicated process that involves many assumptions and relies on several dependencies.   Your mention of replacement costs, to me, indicates you are talking about property insurance of some kind, home for example.   With property insurance, you as the insured would pick your deductible level.  Pricing would then be calculated as the probabilities of different loss amounts, (total loss - deductible), times the loss amount.  Calculating the probabilities is the bulk of the work.  They are calculated by rating criteria.  These vary by insurance type and provider, but a general list would begin with age, gender, home age, geographic region, home value, claims history, etc...   The above process is standardized by creating curves of multiplicative factors based on rating criteria, so providers can calculate a quick rate for you when you ask for a quote.  Underwriters then verify that you match the rating criteria that was used to quote you a rate."

Also Rylai's is 3 pieces, make sure you dont fill your inventory with damage items and neglect to ward.   To be honest if I had a Luxury item I'm not big on Rylai's for Annie. You'll probably land AoE cc with the Tibbers, and continue pumping it out with your W, I dont think a small slow from Rylai's is going to mean a world of difference. The health is nice, but it's not going to stop you from getting melted, Annie has great range and doesnt need to walk into a fight like that.   I'd personally grab Haunting Guise, Voidstaff, or maybe DFG.

LeagueofLegendsMeta,"Play him mid lane, probably better results given the meta.   If you want to play him top, pick him INTO a matchup you feel confident, and never blind pick wukong for top. The matchups up there are so hard for wukong that you need to be playing below your skill level to win them. (implying you sure can win if you're a plat vs gold and below.   At equal skill level no way you win, say, a renekton vs wukong. A general rule in this game is champ belong to categories, mana/no mana, burst/sustain damage, resilient/non resilient (there are more but i'm in a rush). Let's say Wukong is a mana burst non resilient champ. Renekton for example is a non mana burst/sustain resilient champ. It's not even about skill, you lose straight on paper the champ is just superior in a 1v1 scenario, same for pretty much every top matchup vs wukong, hell, being mana gated with no form of defense won't work up there, it just can't. That's why he is bad in the top lane. However his mid lane is super strong, your burst is enough to win a lot of matchup, and the fact that people aren't used to it plays in your favor.   Put every factor to your side. Also solo queue is about winning lane if you intend to climb consistently."
LeagueofLegendsMeta,"This mindset is good, no doubt, however that's not how soloq works for solo lanes. You have to pick a "safe" champ if picking first, you can't pick your fav champ first if he isn't in a good spot in the meta. However you can pick him blindly when you know your experience on it will have so much weight that your enemy won't deal with you, however in that case it means you are probably playing below your skill level. You have to RESPECT your enemies, if you are smurfing, sure go ahead and disrespect, if you are not, you can't rely on your champ to scale better of late game.   In top lane or mid lane against an opponent as skilled as you you won't come back from 0/2 or 0/3 without your team helping you, meaning you are a burden to your team which you shouldn't be, as a solo lane role is to carry almost whole game while the adc shines in the end. What i mean is if you pick a losing matchup because its your fav champ and you think you can overcome, don't be mad when you lost at 20 because your mid/top and bot fed or smthg. You never put your self in a position to carry in the first place.   Respect your opponents, or blame yourself. Some champs are just not in a good spot, use them cautiously. Getting carried, and waiting for the late game are different things. Being 100cs and one or two kills behind your enemy and winning late game means someone in your team pulled your weight during this whole time somehow. Sure you where there to pick your quadra, good job. But if your mid and bot performed early as poorly as you did game would end with the "Defeat" screen.  its SOLOqueue, you NEED to pull your own weight, you can't assume that your enemy won't abuse you.   This is one of the most common mistake in soloq, people picking their champs into anything because they are good at them, they forget that they might be playing against someone as good or better as them, and put themselves and their team at disadvantage before game even started."
LeagueofLegendsMeta,"AD corki provides substantial AP damage (half his end-game damage is magic damage) on top of augmenting sustained AD damage for your team, which is why some full AD teams would run ADC corki (bot) over any other ADC on occasion, as well as being a reasonable mid substitute for sieging comps.   In the context you're providing of Fenix' AP corki mid in the TL-CLG game, AP corki was built on top of the Juggermaw comp as a poking force before or between engagements. What does this mean? When the two teams were  dancing around each other , CLG trying to get a good engage off and TL dealing damage kiting at a distance; AP corki sends a barrage of missiles, poking CLG down and  deterring them from engaging at a lower health  on multiple members at choke points. He's essentially setting up kills for the Juggermaw to mow down.   What AP corki sacrifices in comparison to other mids is CC and duelling potential. It'd be difficult for him to duel any of the non-tanks upfront without having poked them down somewhat; CC itself isn't as necessary in the comp he's playing into since they aren't playing to pick someone off, and Lulu/nunu/janna provides enough peel force for juggermaw comp.   In terms of alternatives to how AP corki was played, Xerath or Ziggs would have been the closest thing they'd be looking for, however both lack the mobility that corki has to escape dangerous situations; this is especially against a sej.   By no means is this the new meta mid pick ; this was only viable because of TL's team comp and understanding that they could break CLG's comp by poking CLG while they manoeuvre for an engage, leaving CLG with nothing but worse decisions as each missile connects."

I bought mine two years ago and I can still max out every single game at 1080p with 60fps (only thing I haven't maxed out recently was Tesselation on MLL and SSAA of course). The reason I bought a laptop is because I had to travel back and forth for work to different locations every 60 days. It's an Alienware M18x with intel 2860QM and GTX 580Ms x2 in SLI.

I'm of the mindset that you want to be able to buy a monitor every 5-8 years, so personally I like an eye candy monitor like IPS @ 1440 P 60hz that'll last you. With the 60 FPS lock you'll still get smooth frames plus great colors and 1440P with something like an AMD card.

pcgaming,"Many years ago I was one of the top players in the not very large but still quite competitive community of Soldier of Fortune 2. I was somewhat aware of the "acceleration is bad" mindset, but eschewed it because I realised that with acceleration, you could theoretically have the best of both worlds - the high precision small movements of low sensitivty, as well as the responsive quick turning of high sensitivity. It was really useful in SoF2 because you needed a certain amount of both. The real problem is getting used to it in terms of muscle memory - It takes much more getting used to than a standard linear mouse speed. I had my own custom sensitivity and acceleration cvars set up in the game (the game allowed you to basically customise your own acceleration curve, it was based on the Q3 engine), and practised a shit-ton to get totally used to it, which I did.   Now that I don't play nearly as competitively, and play a wide range of games with wildly differing sensitivity settings, I much prefer to use a linear sensitivity because it's far easier to get used to differing values."
pcgaming,"Screen tearing happens when your video card's output exceeds the refresh rate of your monitor. Monitors still scan an image from top to bottom, a legacy thing from CRT days. 1080i means rows 1, 3, 5, 7, all the way through 1079 are displayed on one frame, and the next frame displays on rows 2, 4, 6, 8, all the way through 1080. A 1080p display will pass every frame through pixel rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 all the way through 1080. What causes screen tearing is when the monitor receives another frame from the video card before it's done displaying the first. So, a 1080p monitor might be in the middle of scanning and displaying line 979 when the computer suddenly gives it a different image to display. So lines 1 through 979 are frame one, while lines 980 through 1080 are frame two. Your average monitor can display an image 60 times a second (60hz), so if the computer feeds it images faster than that it can't finish displaying the first before it gets the order to display the next. As such, reducing graphics settings can  increase  screen tearing as it allows the video card to render at a more rapid framerate, potentially inducing multiple tears per monitor refresh if you go over double your monitor's refresh rate. Example: Monitor draws lines 1-347 based on frame 1, lines 348-900 based on frame 2 and and lines 901-1080 on frame 3. VSync forcibly caps your framerate to that which the monitor can display as well as placing the image in phase with the monitor, which introduces tangible input lag as each rendered frame based on the new input is forced to wait in the buffer a few dozen extra milliseconds. Turning up your graphics settings so stupidly high that your framerate no longer exceeds the refresh rate of your display is a way to mitigate screen tearing, though it's still possible for the image to be out of phase with the monitor, EX 60fps video always starting at line 47, drawing all the way through 1080 and then going back and being lines 1 through 46 of your monitor's next refresh cycle, with the next frame starting on line 47 again. Also, if you're playing in any sort of windowed mode then Windows has already single buffer vsynced the game through the Windows compositor (because it's impossible for two different applications to be on the same screen at the same time running different refresh rates), so turning on ingame vsync as well adds unnecessary input lag."

SanJoseSharks,"But the buyout at this point only saves us $2m, so it might not even be worth it. Not from a fan standpoint, but from a player standpoint. Wilson did a lot when he vouched for Torres and took the fine this summer and kept Kearns around. There's a trade off point where a buyout is worth the roster spot vs. the good will you build with the rest of your team and potential targets when you say, "Hey... we realize you've had a rough go, and you have a huge contract that we could save some money on, but we stand by the guys in our locker room and we're going to stick out the deal we made.""

toronto,"Yesterday Eastbound on the Lakeshore I was in the lane for the Gardiner On Ramp at Simcoe tooting merrily along when I noticed the Abell Exterminator van behind to my left getting closer and closer. Then I noticed his blinker was on, and he was attempting to merge through me (his front wheel was pretty much in line with my rear wheel). If I was in a car, I would have been pinned. Luckily I had time and space to swerve, add a little throttle and get out of there.  The car behind me had to hit the brakes to avoid the back end of the merging van and chose to slam on his horn as well. This caused me to look back and I realized the driver of the van was on a cell phone.   Of course I took down his vehicle number and called the extermination company he worked for when I got home."
toronto,"Umm, this guy sounds crazy, and he just happens to be gay. I live around the same area and I know of a couple of people who seem a little bit "off".   The take-away here is: the LGBT community is like any other. There are bound to be a few creepy folks who just happen to fall within the LGBT spectrum. I'm gay, and I've hung around in the village a fair amount, and it's not unheard of to get stuck talking to an older creepy guy now and again. It's particularly jarring for some straight guys because they're not used to being on the receiving end of that kind of interaction. Not to say that all straight guys are creepy or anything.   My suggestion to you is take the high road and and let him know that his attention is unwelcome. From then on, just ignore him. He's probably just doing it to get a reaction out of you."
toronto,"I have seen this man before walking his dogs on the trail near where I live. I have only seen him once, but it was enough for me to know I needed to stay far away from his man. I was walking my dog (who often barks and lunges at other dogs), and when I saw him coming in the opposite direction I panicked a little. My dog thankfully did not bark at his dogs, but while we were passing in opposite directions I couldn't help but notice how uncomfortable his dogs looked. First off he looks very menacing, and secondly the moment he saw me he started tugging on the rope tied to his two dogs and they began cowering. The single rope tied to his dogs only have maybe a foot for each dog so the dogs walks uncomfortably close together, and I was stunned with the way that his dogs reacted to him tugging on the already short rope he has them tied to. He then walked by me again (same day, maybe 20 minutes later) when I was sitting in the park under a tree and I decided to snap a picture of him for "insurance" purposes.  This [picture]( was taken mid July."

BPD,"such an intense feeling of loneliness which can probably also be attributed to the fact that whenever I did find someone I genuinely wanted to be with, they would end up rejecting me. A non-BPD person probably wouldn't even bat an eye about, but for someone like me - who can easily put people on a pedestal - it hurt like hell.   well that hit me squarely in the feels. It happens a lot, and it sucks.   I (a guy, for what it's worth), am awful at the whole dating thing. I've only had 3 relationships, all only since starting college 4 years ago, and the longest was 3 months over this past summer. I knew her just under a week before we started dating. I'm pretty sure I was into it mostly for the fact that she seemed incredibly into me. Like more than I've ever seen in someone before. I'll be honest, at a base, deep-down level, I just want some attention. I want to feel like someone cares about me and that I actually mean something to someone. So being presented that was attractive. However, I realized that that was how I felt, and that I didn't think I actually liked her (and she was going back out of state for college), so I broke up with her. Nothing was going wrong - it was quite nice actually - I just didn't feel like it anymore.   When I see someone I think it attractive, or looks like they might be interesting, I get really nervous and am 9 times out of 10 too scared to ever say anything. Hell, it took me all of this semester to finally talk to a girl who I saw pretty often and I thought (and was correct about) went to my high school (she was 2 years younger though, so I never actually knew her).   But it seems that any time I find someone interested, as you point out, it ends up going no where. Maybe I'm just unlucky in things? It still hurts a lot, because it means so much to me to want to not be lonely anymore. I've been sad pretty much all day because I've been thinking about this (ergo this rant). That girl I mentioned earlier, I had asked her if she wanted to meet for coffee over the weekend, and originally she said yes, but later had to cancel to study for exams. Makes sense, I was okay with it. Texted her on Monday to see if she was free after class: she was done before I even had class and was going downtown with a friend. No problem, it was last minute. I spent all day Tuesday on campus working on stuff and decided to text her if she was free and wanted to hang on campus: no reply. So now I'm sad about that. Last night I was out to dinner with my best friend who will actually text/call me to do stuff on a regular basis. Nice girl, but (sometimes unfortunately, sometimes not) just friends. There was a cute girl sitting with friends a table over, whom I pointed out to my friend. She agreed with me. I spent the rest of the night sad about how I'd never see her again."
cringe,"Last night at work, I was telling a coworker about a video I saw on reddit yesterday and how it was really sad and made me cry. So, as most sad videos on here, other redditors are like "if this made you cry you should see this." So naturally, I watched about 45 minutes worth of sad videos and then I come across the no cry challenge. He asks what it was and I explain, and start to tell him about the saddest video from yesterday. I can't remember the name of it, but it was about 7 minutes long and it was a camera crew following and documenting the final moments of this man and his dog. The dog had cancer I believe. He had all of his friends say goodbye and him and his wife/girlfriend took the dog to the vet to have him put down and this man was just in tears, as was I. So I then proceed to tell him about the time when I had to go put my dog down because he needed a surgery we couldn't afford. I told him how much pain my dog was in, and how badly I was crying and how when the lady put the injection in, how I could slowly see peace coming into his eyes. At this point in the story, I happen to look up (we weren't really looking at each other because we were cleaning so I was completely oblivious to his reaction and just kept running my mouth) and he says please stop, I can't talk about this. And he turned around and had to compose himself for a few minutes. I felt AWFUL. I still feel awful. It got really awkward and we didn't really talk much for the last few hours. I was fighting tears the whole time. I don't know how to handle awkward situations, especially when its my fault, so when I went to the cooler to get more carrots, I stood in there and just cried for about five minutes. I couldn't sleep last night because I felt terrible."
cringe,"Like two months ago a co-worker of mine met his mom at our work so they could spend the day together (he wasn't working that day, it was just a nice in-between location for them). He ends up being 20 minutes late, so another coworker and I start talking with her. I ask her if she has any embarrassing stories about him and what he was like as a child. Kind of light-hearted, funny kind of stuff. Eventually he shows up and I'm telling him that I don't believe that his mom is actually his mom. She's far too cool and nice to be the mother of such a dick-bag. I say, "I bet you paid this nice, old lady to pretend to be your mom." And then I froze dead in my tracks. I did not mean to say old. It just rolled off the tongue. I meant to just say nice; like, "this nice lady." But instead I'm a total dick. I still feel bad about it."
cringe,"I worked on Need for Speed last summer in Detroit. My job required me to do a lot of running around the city. When I first started, I was very weary about where I parked, and would usually park inside the expensive parking garages. Finally, after a few days, it got to the point where I was just parking wherever, and would sometimes leave my car parked for hours in places where parking might not have been allowed or the meters were broken. Never once got a ticket the entire time. I was astounded about how little the police gave a shit."
cringe,"Thanks for the replies.   What if I saw the trails and said they're beautiful like a piece of art. Do the trails then go from nothing to art, or does there have to be something tangible that I can show or perform for others?   I always thought art was something that inspired emotion. So by my definition, anything can be art. I may see a freshly mowed lawn, and say that's beautiful. However, I also believe art to be subjective, so what pulls emotion out of me might not do the same for you. Hence what's his name thinking B L A K I E isn't art, but you and whoever else does. You might see the same lawn mentioned earlier and say that it's just a lawn, what's so beautiful about it?   Of course, by my definition, even a negative emotion would validate it as art and make what's his name incorrect, since he's obviously having a negative emotional response to the performer."
cringe,"Ignoring the rapist/murder analogy (because it was pretty weak on my part), an issue I have with libertarians generally is a conflation of the ideas of being selfish and being self-interested.   Arguing that you don't like the social safety net because you don't use it and you don't care about other people's lives isn't necessarily self-interested, but it is definitely selfish. For example, unless you come from a place with enough relative privilege that you know your personal and your family's wealth will be able to allow you to weather whatever may come your way in life then you may well need the social safety net someday and being opposed the existence of something like that until you need it is impractical, short sighted and hypocritical.   Allowing yourself to wind up homeless and starving on moral principle because you stick to your guns and continue not supporting a social safety net even when you do need it is just dumb. I'm not saying you're arguing anything like that, but I've run into a few libertarians around reddit who make the claim that this is how they would react to such a situation.   Now if you do come from that place of such self-assured privilege that you don't have to ever fear you may need public assistance in any form, that means you and/or your family have quite a bit of wealth, and even then you benefit from the social safety net indirectly. Being able to maintain a solidly middle-class or higher lifestyle requires a degree of social stability. Lots of things contribute to criminality, but poverty is a strong driver of violent criminality.   A strong social safety net isn't the only thing important to maintaining social stability (and the US fails in a lot of ways to do so in my opinion), but it absolutely helps a lot of people through hard times without putting them in a position to have to potentially threaten your safety through wanton criminality. Growing masses of hopeless and desperately poor people breeds all kinds of badness, and one way our society avoids those problems is providing a robust safety net.   A lot of libertarians I've come across never get past the whole "taxes are theft" and "why should I have to pay for someone else's food" and "I was born into a relatively stable situation that didn't require public assistance, so why can't everyone else be similarly situated." It all seems very short sighted. Society is a real thing, and a stable society benefits all of us directly and indirectly. At the same time that excessive government spending can destabilize society, being unwilling to provide some security to the most poor and desperate among us can too."
summonerswar,"ok being a dark chimera owner and using violent revenge i will say one thing.   You won't find dark chimeras that hit hard if they got 25k hp.   Point being is that you need 100% crit in order to attack 3 times and to fit that on top of atk hp etc is nigh impossible.   If you encounter a Zeratu that hits really hard, chances are you can hit them just as hard bc they have little hp.   If you encounter a Zeratu that has high hp, chances are they don't hit that hard (unless you are facing kadath from Golem luck, then... good luck! lol)   If you feel Zeratu is over powered, try using Chloe and Katarina against them, even Lushen can monkey dunk Zeratu if runed correctly.   Zeratu has a weakness and that is his speed, he is incredibly slow, and if you use slot 2 for speed instead of hp or attack, you will notice the difference when he can't take a hit or give enough damage before Chasun Chloe Bella etc recover it.   Also Zeratu hates bella, bc Zeratu will generally hide behind Chloe's shield before his time to shine, but Bella removes his hide and seek shield and says welcome to hell lol. Bella removing Zeratu's shield and getting a defense debuff on him on a violent round or by a darion etc is a kiss of death.   So"
CuckoldCommunity,"I actually don't get the whole SPH stuff tbh. I think that's because I'm fairly well endowned and I've never really had insecurities about that. In terms of subbing..the actual image of her fucking someone else disgusts me and doesn't even turn me on, it's just the embarrassment of not being first choice, being left at home missing out and her just not giving a fuck about what I think and doing what she wants whilst controlling me is what turns me on. I guess I've always been insecure about girls only being attracted to me, which is obviously a ridiculous thing to want. But you can't help instincts.   In terms of domming though it's all about humiliating my cuckquean. I think that side is fueled by rage and sadism because outside of cucking..in usual D/s sex, really embarrassing the girl and like choking whilst gagging them is hot."
typography,"Love questions like this one: people from other disciplines looking for tips on how to improve their typographic layouts.   What layout program are you using? If you have CS6, I'm assuming InDesign. That means you have access to lots of typographic goodies.   I would say you should use Garamond throughout. You can separate sections with varying weights, italics, and space.   Take a look at the designer [Frank Chimero鈥檚 book "The Shape of Design."]( Disregard the illustrations and notice that he is using color to separate certain bits, but other than that, it's all one typeface.   I would try mimicking what Frank has done here. Obviously yours won't look quite as designy, but here's the things I think are worth picking up:     Try not to use a wide range of point sizes. Use Adobe Garamond's ample weights to differentiate content.     Make the line length of your body block about 2-3 alphabets. This probably entails making your left and right margins much wider.     If you're doing headlines or subheads as all caps, add more tracking. Google "add tracking InDesign" to find out how to do this.     Spend way too long figuring this system out for one page. Choose a page with as many little fiddly bits -- footnotes, a subhead, etc. -- as you can find. Once that page is figured out, try a variation on it. Print them out and compare them. If you have time to do a dozen variations, great, but I'm assuming this is overkill for people who don't design professionally. There's no such thing as the best layout, but it can at least help you feel confident in your decision."
diablo3,"I can't say that I have tried the 5pc bonus. But I will have to say unless you drop a LOT of cash you can get much better or comparable rares.   The issue is that very little of the set is absolute endgame. Helm I would rather have a crit mempo. Boots firewalkers can roll better and ice climbers blow them out of the water.

diablo3,"Don't bother with anything but cranking to 70 first off. You're not likely to use the mystic all that much before 70 since you swap out gear so often, and the blacksmith is no good for the same reason. I do recommend leveling the Jeweler, as you will likely want to up some gems as you go. Its very nice while leveling to have a socket in the helm and the largest ruby you can craft (for the bonus xp), but generally the ruby you find is good enough.   You can get by just fine with the drops you get in game and appropriate skill setups to match the gear you have.   I would sell everything below 60 and then just about everything not legendary after 60, just to amass gold, as you will eventually be spending millions on crafting Gems and a pittance more on re-rolls.   The crafting mats you care about are those from 61-70, since they get used in everything craft-ably useful."

washingtondc,"Its hard to explain Seattleites.  My friends/family I have out there are all great people.  Its just hard to break into a new group of friends out there.   I'm not making this up ( we call it the "Seattle Freeze".   The hardest part for people to get about this is the idea of, 'I have friends from Seattle and they're awesome people.. great to get along with, etc." Well, people like them are not like the majority of people in Seattle.  Or different factors influence them to be more socially able to maintain a friendship than otherwise..   Or, they visit Seattle and every person you meet will talk to you on the street, ask them for directions and they'll gladly tell you.  May even ask where you're from and be geniunely interested in what you have to say.  But moving from that casual, "oh you're a person who's not from here" to "You're a person I want to spend more time with" is extremely difficult.   Some people claim it doesn't really exist and people who suck at social interactions make this shit up.  Bullshit.  My brother, a man who literally sweats charisma has people blow him off/no-show with such ridiculous consistency its stupid.   On the other hand, it taught me to commit to things, and if I commit to it, be there.  Because it can seriously hurt relationships if you consistently fuck that up."
CHIBears,"My boyfriend got me interested in football this year, after my family had been trying to get me interested in the Bears my entire life. The difference was that he drew me a diagram of the positions, starting with offense, then a seperate diagram for defense. He explained what each position was for, and then i understood what was going on. It's not fun to watch football if you dont get what the players do, then its just a bunch of guys throwing the ball around. Trying to explain it during the game is a pain and i just didnt have the patience for it. Seriously try the diagram and then repeatedly teach her who the main players are. Once i knew who people were and what they did, it mattered if they won."
BipolarReddit,"Never be afraid to open up to a psychiatrist/therapist, even if it's something as strange as sexual thoughts about them. They can't help you if you don't give them an accurate description of your symptoms.   Have you told her about your difficulty sleeping? She might recommend adding a sleeping aid. In the meantime, try using Benadryl as a sleep aid if your insomnia persists more than two or three nights. You may have some groggy mornings, but it might help add a few hours.   And yes, hallucinations. Dancing shadows, figures in the corner of my eyes (some very distinct but unrecognizable), and headlights flashing at night (sometimes the flashing persists even when I close my eyes at night). Since starting Lamictal, it's become less frequent, only happening when I'm manic and haven't had a lot of sleep.   The sequence of letters doesn't establish your humanity. The sequence of letters is just the name given to a collection of cognitive and behavioral tendencies. YOU determine your humanity by fighting the destructive impulses. Keep in mind though, that humanity is an ideal separate and distinct from the way humans and society behave. Maintain your functionality and embody humanity as an ideal rather than conforming to social expectations and trying to fit in, that's just hiding away."
BipolarReddit,"I am 23, but my partner and I have been together for 5 years -by some amazing providence, we've managed to grow up together well, and it just gets better.   However- It is not always good. Ready for an absolutely huge block of text?   Any relationships have hard times, and unfortunately we will create hard times. They will have to deal with stuff from us that another couple would never have to dream of. It is someone of a special breed who can live with us, and make it work. You will need to accept that he will always feel worried and frustrated for you in one sense, but there are definitely things you can do to help alleviate this and aid your communication.   1. Have other outlets   That is for both of you.   You need other people, so that when he is overwhelmed he is not your only line of defence. He needs people to help with you. Even though he may bear the brunt of a lot of it- he is the person who has to see you everyday, who you will feel most open with- he can't be your everything because that is a hard thing for him. So you have your pdoc, but it is useful if you have other places to go and people to trust. I know this is hard. For me, it is my sister and one close friend. My parents are fantastic, but they live a fair way away. I do go up alone for a week every now and again- it is nice for me to have family time, but if we've had a hard time I know it is good to let him refresh. Recently I had not been doing so well, and he had planned a three week camping holiday with his 'boys.' He was feeling guilty and worried about going because I had a bad episode just before, but I was able to show him that there were others that could be there for me instead for that time, and that it is okay for him to prioritise himself when he needs to.   Part two of that is, he needs other people to help him. Initially I didn't want anybody at all to know about my severe episodes of depression, later diagnosed as bipolar. But this was unfair. He needed someone to talk to, and while he could talk to my family or friends, he really needed someone for himself. So I let him tell one of his best mates- who I am good friends with too- and just having someone else he could tell when things weren't good, someone to lend a hand who understood exactly what he was helping with, was worth the world. As time goes on, it might not be a bad idea for him to speak to someone professional, but it is always important that you let him have an outlet, no matter how secret you want to keep it.   2. Get your vocabulary down   My partner has heard it all- good, bad, and the ugly. But if you keep hitting him every day with every terrible thought in your head can take a toll. Flipside is, there are often days when I really don't want to talk at all, and he would get really worried at what was going down in my head.   This is why you have to come up with your own language. If you can talk him through everything early, then he will know what it means if -in my case- you say you are 'jittery' or 'bouncy' or 'restless.' For me, these are three examples which indicate that I am on a mild upswing, but to watch it depending on if it is (jittery) 'anxiety, racing thoughts, panics, need for reassurance, resistance to reassurance,', (bouncy) 'feeling really upbeat, creative, often a lot of fun, but with the potential for grand ideas, overspending if it gets too far' or (restless) 'dissatisfaction, prone to anger, quick flips in mood, probably he should stay out of the line of fire.' Because he knows me, these words, and now an amazing ability to read my physical cues, from this little information he understands my headspace, and has a way of asking how I am feeling without making me describe every symptom. One of the worst things we have, is when I tell him I feel 'really bad,' then it means I know I don't have to say that word 'suicidal.' And he knows this is when he needs to take control and stay vigilant. I have hundreds of these words- depression is often a lot more complicated to explain- but it is just so vital that you can let him in on how you are going without overwhelming him, and so he has a vocabulary framework in which to ask you how you are going.   3. Keep in touch with how he is doing   It can become habit just to talk about how you are going. It's not selfish, it is just that often how you are going will have the more immediate impact, and this is what he will want to talk about most. But it is important that you ask him, very often, how he is going.   You will ask how he is going with friends/work/life, and obviously this kind of connection is important in any relationship. But, particularly after a bad episode, it is good to make sure you do a debrief. Talk to him about how he felt. It is a good outlet, but it often gives you an outside look into how you present. This can help you in the long run- he might notice a pattern in behaviour or corresponding actions which indicate something you hadn't thought of.  But it is good for you to understand more how he is feeling at specific times - helplessness is often a huge problem- then you can reassure him, and keep a dialogue open about what you need to be doing. Sometimes it is a tweak in the vocabulary above, and sometimes it is knowing that if you have had a few bad days, or weeks, or successive episodes, how this is impacting him specifically. Know when he needs a break, and when you can really help him out with this. It is really scary for him too, and often scarier because he is watching someone he loves fall to pieces, or fly too high, and doesn't know what to do. Telling him after what he did that was good and what could have helped is good. But I find, even after five years, sometimes it is just so necessary to tell him he has done everything he can. That he did everything right. That even if it went downhill, that you know and feel that he could not have done anymore to stop it. Make him know that his hard work is making a difference, even when it doesn't seem that way to him.   4. Give him an out   This is the hardest thing you will do, but I honestly feel like if you love them enough, this is one of the most important things to do.   Let him know that if this gets too hard, it is okay. You can say you don't know what you would do without him- but it is important to tell him that you will do something.   You do not want him staying because he feels obligated, or scared, or overwhelmed. You want him to stay because he loves you, and feels that there is a lot more good coming from the relationship than bad. That is not to say that he will not feel frustrated, angry, overwhelmed, unable to get away. But if this is a feeling he is having all the time- if this outweighs the pleasure in the relationship- you need him to know that you will let him go if he needs it, with no guilt. There can be a particular concern when it comes to someone breaking up with someone over an inability to cope with the complications of mental illness.Sometimes there is an unwillingness, a feeling of failure, or a feeling of self loathing which accompanies someone who wants to get out of a relationship with someone with mental health issues. That they are letting you down.   This is the fear you are talking about when you say you think he will decide you are too much work. And you might be for him. This does not reflect badly on either of you, even though it may hurt.   Unfortunately you will always be 'hard work' but everyone is in their own way. Everyone has flaws and problems that makes their relationship complicated. One person can be happy with someone, where another would self combust. For someone, you will not be too much, and I hope that it is this guy. I believe that I have my match, and that if there is anyone for me it is my partner. He not only makes me happy as a person, but the way in which he has been able to roll with the punches that bipolar throws is a constant amazement to me. He has kept making the choice to stick by me, but I always want him to know that I appreciate it is a choice.   Just like it would be okay for me to break up with him for any of a hundred reasons, you need to be sure that they know that bipolar is allowed to be a reason. This will benefit you in the long run too.   4. Enjoy the good times   Seems stupid, and I know you know this, but make sure you enjoy the good times. Be silly, do things you both love. If you have had a bad episode it is really nice to do something nice together- out or in- to boost both of your spirits. Unlike almost any others, we bipolars know what a gift it is to be able to control your own feelings, and to consciously choose to use them for good. This is a relationship after all- not a nursing home, even though it can feel like that. Take every chance you can to connect with each other. Keep the relationship first in your lives, everything else is details.   I hope that made sense  and that some of it helped."
osugame,"lol $20 bucks for just a $2 sticker and $18 of Horo cutting it to size. What a great deal.   The "covers" are just laminated stickers of pictures of any size. Just get an image, go to a printing shop, ask them to print this to size on sticker paper, go home, place it on your tablet, cut out the excess, and you're done.   Although, it's impossible for me because the nearest one is 2 miles away. And I'm lazy.   Edit: I'm exaggerating. But my printing shop sell for $6 ~ $10, although I never bought it. So I should research my sources."
PurplePillDebate,"Assuming it actually went down that way...She tried to manipulate him. That's immature and bad news. He picked up and got out. That's awesome. That's standing up for yourself and what you want. That's not dominate. That's just having self-worth.   > Expresses great interest in how I dominated her   I seriously doubt she used the word dominate. I can't imagine a world where removing yourself from a toxic situation = domination. Those two just aren't the same thing.   >  I begrudgingly complied as I wanted to know what happened.   I wouldn't have given this girl the time a day, much less meet up somewhere later. This guy's seeking validation and I'm not sure it's healthy to try and get it from this girl. But props to her for apologizing."
PurplePillDebate,"1) Why are you on askwomen? That is one of the worst subs to go to. They want politically correct, sugar-coated responses that agree with the hivemind. Anything else is not allowed and will be banned. The mods actively censor whatever the hell they  feel  like censoring.   2) You're comment is logical and makes sense. An opposite generalization could be applied to men. I think this is why it got downvoted so much--your comment used logic, which, as we know, women don't respond well to.   3)  >Most men like women who are thin to average weight, with long hair. Most women like men who are tall and fit.   Yes but with the advent of feminism and the HAES (healthy at every size) bullshit going on, saying this in public violates political correctness and is therefore frowned upon. If I walk up to a fat person and call her fat, I would not be wrong. I'm making a correct observation about that female. But that observation hurts her precious feelings^TM and therefore, thanks to feminism, I'm branded an evil misogynist who can't handle a real woman^TM.   Women do like men that are tall and fit, but they will never admit this. Women have too much pride and so ardently believe in the (false) special snowflake mentality that they will never, for a second, admit that they can be generalized. Men on the other hand have no problem when someone says "Men want thin women!" Yes, we want thin women, they make our dicks hard, fat women don't.   4)   >So, why is this something that angers people so much? Nobody could tell me, on that thread, why I was wrong.   See my explanation for #3 regarding political correctness. In addition to that bit, you  aren't wrong,  which is why they can't explain why you are wrong. You aren't. You just upset them because you ( gasp ) suggested that not all women are special snowflakes, which is threatening the askwomen hivemind.   5)   >All people did was downvote.   That's kind of all they can do. They are strong independent women, after all, and they show just how strong, mature, independent they are by pressing a button on the internet, knowing that it will liberate women across the world.   6)   >And while I know personality is important, that doesn't negate the fact that most men prefer a woman who is in shape to a woman who is 100 lb overweight, and most women prefer a man who is tall and fit to a man who isn't.  It's not really fair, but denying it won't make it not true.   And now you've touched upon the heart of the issue. These people, these crazies who believe in HAES bullshit, or that women prefer scrawny skinny guys over tall fit ones, are so crazy that they actually want to deny reality.  Moreover, they want to actively censor people who express this reality. Stop using logic on AW, and stop saying "it's the truth." You will never win on that sub, and if you keep it up, you will be banned I guarantee it.   7)   >Why is this even debated? Isn't it common knowledge that some people are considered more physically attractive by a larger amount of folks than others?   Yes, but it's the big elephant in the room no one wants to admit. Feminists won't admit it because they want people to believe their false notion of reality. Anti-feminists won't admit it because it is not politically correct to do so."
PurplePillDebate,"I'm gonna regret making this post...     Not all genetic population clusters have the same intelligence.  Case in point: Ashkenazi Jews.  Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews go to the same schools as the Ashkenazim, and they aren't the top scientists in Israel.  Genes fucking matter.  By extension, they also matter with Gentile populations.     I hate Romani culture.  I believe they need to stop being degenerate and teaching their kids to fail at life if they don't want to be subject to antizigianism from even the most progressive, tolerant people.  If the gadje treated them like they treated the gadje, they would call that racism.  For anyone from /r/romani reading this, sure, your music is beautiful but we don't live in the 19th century, so the tinker skill isn't used, your blood feud suck, your tackiness with large houses sucks, damn near everything about your culture fucking sucks and you make African-Americans and even Native Americans look like a model minority.   I say this more in reference the Finnish Kale than Romani-Americans.  You want to live free and not stay in one place?  Fine.  But don't come crying because you can't have your cake and eat it too.   There are certain things to do if you want to be wealthy and successful.  Getting pregnant as a teen and having your kids be uneducated isn't one of them.  P.S. I have yet to hear a single pleasant word about your prostitutes.     I think Icelanders, by nature of their height, skull shape, blondism, etc., are genetically superior to all the billions of wide-nosed, prognathid peoples from Filipinos to Bantus to Australian Aborigines.  I want Nordic genes to be propagated.  I'd be happy for the gene for Jonas Savimbi's nose to die out.  That's just my aesthetic preference as an autistic weirdo.   I am very glad that I am mostly on of Northwest European ancestry and only 1/16th Cherokee (my Nana's grandfather--she has the classic "mestizo" appearance which made it hard for her to fit in with her fellow Anglo white girls at school).  I say this because I don't like shortness or being diabetic, and Scottish genes are much better in both regards.  Even though the Cherokee were awesome before Jackson fucked with them.     I think most Australoid women are hideous.  That protruding brow is apelike and archaic, not sexy.  Obesity and degeneracy, and lack of boobs and curves, round out the package.  The only good part is their blond hair."
PurplePillDebate,"TBP is definitely a SJW sub. The posts sound exactly like ShitRedditSays.   SJWs are spoiled, delusional brats with too much free time, basically. They were presumably bullied as children or some shit, and now they get to finally be the bullies on Tumblr, Reddit, Twitter, etc.   What sets them apart from normal internet trolls is that their shitty behavior aligns strongly with an extreme brand of the outrage and victimhood culture that we're quite familiar with in the West. The narrative is everything, and any facts that distract from the narrative are dismissed immediately. While some of those on the extreme left are naive with good intentions, this pack of dipshits are just hateful freaks who will dismiss anything a straight white man says because he is a straight white man. Everyone else is to be treated as a helpless victim."
PurplePillDebate,"Never used the word neckbeard, that would be you. Not jumping on shaming people for not getting laid, Am saying that its not a womans place to punish or reward you for  anything .   Although I was rewarded for being sensitive and whatnot, if by "rewarded" you mean "I have a wonderful relationship which sorta by default tears into the whole argument that is being made that guys are not allowed to be sensitive."   Infact, none of my female friends are dating unemotional douchbags. Every single one of my female friends that have partners are dating utterly wonderful people.   If I said anything about Incels its that they are not neckbeardy enough! That they try so fucking hard to be manly men that they lose all sense of personality which is what  causes  them to remain as fucking Incels!   Drop the incel act, drop the language, stop being so fucking defensive and don't call neckbeard whenever you get criticised."
PurplePillDebate,"Wait, what? Oh god, are you another incel?   Its not a womans place to "Reward" or "punish" you for anything. At all. Being open with yourself is about you and will make you live a happier, healthier life.   As for the whole "Incel" thing? It seems that  everyone  I have met online that calls themselves an Incel submits most closely to the "ideals" of the perfect man rather than some emotional wreck.   So...   I guess I am saying that the "Incentive" of showing emotion is, well, affection and all the rest, a healthier outlook and more honest friends.   Bounced it off my girlfriend and she said, without a moments pause, that she would rather be with a guy who shows emotion than one who bottles it up. But I guess she is biased?   Pretty much every guy that I know who happens to be in a relationship is willing to show emotion and doesn't bottle it up. Too anecdotal?   Well, This is the internet. I could go find a source. But its midnight."
PurplePillDebate,"Most red pill story I know.   Young, attractive blonde sixteen year old girl got herself a slightly older boyfriend. Lost virginity to him but he seemed uninterested in marriage. She flirts with and tries to pick up older married men at sports club. these guys were very blue pill and turned her down, but did gossip about it amongst themselves. She finds red pill man who is keen to cheat on his wife with her. Concerned friends tell wife about affair. Wife is very red pill, trim, attractive,submissive SAHM, eventually asks husband about rumours and believes him when he denies it.   Sick of waiting, 16yo gets pregnant and tells red pill guy. He dumps faithful wife and moves in with teenage fling. Wife returns to parents in another town and I lose touch with her. Presumably red pill guy sees his children less.   Red pill guy marries teenage fling and she has three kids over the next five years. Still looks really hot and they are still married. I see her quite a bit and don't see him for months at a time. He works a lot.   I don't ask fling personal questions but someone asks if she is worried she wasted her youth in front of me. She replies that she never wanted a career, just to get married and have kids. She wasn't too concerned about the guy, just that he had a good job so he could support her and the kids. Sex isn't that big of a deal so she doesn't care that he's old.   Rumour has it that her ex-boyfriend is the father of her eldest but I can't speak to the truth of that."
PurplePillDebate,"All contextual.   I was leaving a bar once with some friends and a dude and his friends literally drove up on the sidewalk in a flurry and shouted "get in the car!"   At first we were like what the flying fuck and briefly attempted to run and cuss.   And then he quickly got out and bashfully apologized and said some bs line like you guys were so beautiful I had to pretend kidnap you.   Here's the thing.   You're right. He pulled it off.   He caught us off guard.   He then acted bashful and playful and sincerely apologized.   All while coming off as non-threatening and non aggressive (to make up for the initial surprise.)   And yes on top of that he was physically attractive.   So he went from us ready to call him a creep to winning us over.   And you're right he gets extra time to prove his non-creepiness because he played it well and because he was cute."
stunfisk,"Well, considering ESpeed is already kinda weak even with a 31 IV 4 EV Arcanine, it's probably not the best choice.   Fire Spin might be a good idea to stall some pokemon out, or perhaps Snarl to take special attacks a bit better. Of course, you could run some calcs to see if ESpeed was capable of picking off anything frail, but that's about all the use I can see for it.   I assume you're on cartridge, so I'm not gonna tell you to go back and rebreed because specially based Defensive Arcanine still does its job, but physical ones do it better, in my opinion.   So"
stunfisk,"Im not 100% about the speed tiers/KOs you'll be missing but I do know that Timid is prefered because base 112 speed is a very good/trolly speed teir that when maxed out still gets the jump on a lot of positive natured speedy pokemon. Also its better to use a boosting move for attacking stats e.g. Swords Dance/Nasty Plot as many feel Agility is a waste of a move slot."
AskMen,"Girl here and I would like add my two cents. Here is what I try to tell my brother but he doesn't ever listen, maybe you will. For girls, attractiveness isn't a completely physical thing, maybe initially, you might catch our eye, but overall it is not the most important thing. Once you get to know someone, the way you see them changes. They get more or less attractive depending on their personality. If you are a generally good guy, your attractiveness goes up once we get to know you but if you are a huge douche all the time, even if you look like a Greek god, no girl worth keeping is going to stick around. Also attractiveness is very subjective, me, I personally would want someone who makes me happy and that I feel comfortable with rather than someone who looks good with me because eventually we will both get old and his looks will be gone.   I don't know how old you are but also what women want changes over the years. In high school, a lot of really good guys get overlooked unfortunately because those girls don't know yet to pick substance. They learn eventually but sometimes it takes a while. In college the girls are pretty much split to the ones who still think like high school girls and they just want to have a good time so they pick the physically attractive guys. There are the girls who are looking for someone to have a relationship with, they look for long term features. Lastly there are the girls who just want to keep their heads down and focus on their studies because a bachelors degree is not their final goal. These girls don't really look at anything other than their text books and if you can pry their eyes away, they are also going to want personality."
AskMen,"If you believe you are attractive, you will be attractive. Physical attractiveness is not nearly as important as confidence and knowing you're a boss and any lady would be lucky to have you. That shit drives women nuts. Be assertive but kind, and demonstrate how interesting you are. Looks will quickly fade away when you can confidently ask a woman about her life and pose leading and interesting questions. Make her laugh and it's game over."
AskMen,"Oh, they do not get them as far. However, I assure you, that on a first meeting basis, an attractive personality on anyone is not going to get one far. However, if one adds prolonged contact to both, than it muddles up and is less clear. but in my life so far through personal( more weighted to what I previously mentioned) and through threads like these one really can't generalize how one sex acts towards the other.   Women are apt to view looks secondary, though in my experience not more so. I have experienced this through observation, not participation maybe that effects it.   Secondly, men seem to always be characterised for putting looks secondary to other things. However, I find this only works under the hivemind. A man with friends might focus on looks( or will stay quiet), whereas a man having  a man to man chat will not focus on looks so much, and once a certain depth of conversation is reached, puts a lot more importance on personality for a relationship   Also, I have, not often but I have, hung out and listened to groups of women. I find that they often betray that which you present as fact. I found that in a group, just like men, they are, in my personal experience,  extremely looks oriented. They criticize men I know, celebrities, random people across the street for being unattractive or praise them for being attractive. I mention men I know because that accounts for them roughly knowing that guy's personality. So, in the aspect of groups, I have found men and women act similarly. Now, individually, like men, they are a lot more lenient on looks, however, I would not say more so than a man of the same maturity level."
AskMen,"I am a recent graduate and just moved to Chicago and was very happy to find out that a couple of my schoolmates moved here. Three of my best friends here are a lesbian couple and a gay man.   Keep in mind that I also went to art school, but in terms of men I've had many gay friends. They're wonderful and a great resource. It's also mutually beneficial to each other.   For me I was able to meet some really, really attractive women through my gay friends. Pardon for using such an offensive term but I have no other way to describe it, but a lot of attractive girls are "fag hags", in the sense that they don't have too many lady friends so they gravitate to gay men to be their best friends.   Being friends with that gay guy is a great in to these girls. It means that you're safe and that you can hang with both of them and have your friend vouch for you.   It also works for the gay guys as well. You need to understand that at their core gay guys are essentially the same as straight dudes when they're on the prowl. It's just that their intentions are more well known. I live near Halsted in Chicago, which is infamous for being the gay district, and I always go out and be a bro to my gay friend and wingman him whenever we go to those bars.   It's less pay it forward and more me using myself to his advantage. Just like a regular wingman, gay guys will find someone they fancy but then might get cold feet and bitch out. I on the other hand am a neutral party and since I'm straight can easily start a conversation with the target and wingman him.   It's like when you have a friend who has a girlfriend start the conversation with a woman you want to talk to. Since you made it known that you're not a threat or a target, they ease up, which will allow you to give your friend a fair shot.   EDIT:"
AskMen,"Straight man: I came from a very conservative community, so from my high school, I never really had any gay or openly-gay friends. But now that I moved countries for college, I befriended one. Sure he's 7 years older than I am, but he's probably the coolest friend I have."
AskMen,"Marrying the right girl helps. Once you do that dating crazy bitches that are bad for you is solely your fault. At the workplace politics come into play.   Before this happens:     Know what you want.  I don't mean your mate must be a 10/10 would fuck, super loyal step ford wife of your dreams. I mean real shit. Like SHIT THAT EXISTS. Compatibility, mutual interests, sexual compatibility, etc. Where do you stand and how flexible are you? You need flexibility because compromise will be important. If you don't know his how can you ever be happy?     What type of relationship do you want? Long term maybe marriage, hook ups, short term, one night stand, fuck buddy? Be with the kind of girl that is looking for he same thing you are and will be good in that type of relationship. If you fall for your ONS and decide to marry her it may not go that well.     Don't lie, to yourself or her. It causes problems. Lie about yourself and your intentions and you've laid he groundwork to catch shit later. Lie to them and you're authorizing things you don't like. Your setting bad precedents. This is bigger in the workplace. Lying can cost you a lot.     Be true to yourself. You must compromise but don't be so eager to please you become one of those people whose sole goal is to make the other person happy to the extent that your personality disappears and/or you become a doormat.     Have a spine. It's hard to dump on someone with confidence that understands their self worth.     Clearly define your boundaries. Discuss things and often.     Listen to everything someone says. If they are full of shit or have problems they will usually tell you directly or indirectly. Pay attention. Someone who is nice to you but not nice to the waiter is usually not a nice person. What hey say while not being directly questioned or just pops up may be the most truthful because, I their guard is down, they are speaking off the cuff not trying to feed you bs or something you want to hear.     Communication. If you've got it great. If not you're fucked.     Watch what you say. Not every though you have is valid or appropriate. Anything you say can and will be used against you later.     It's all politics. Understand the relationship dynamic  it will have a bearing on how you should proceed. Having a problem with you SO or boss, there are always other ppl in play. Are they helping you, hurting you, fucking you over?     Cover your ass.     DON'T BE STUPID. Many ppl get blinded by their projection of the situation and what they want. There is so much about this. Just don't be stupid and you'll be better off."
AskMen,"I thought about being a bit more elaborate, but ICEFARMER made a pretty comprehensive and spot on list, so I'll add this tip:   Make sure that at least once, preferrably early on, you have a slight tiff (not a full-on fight or anything) where she's clearly in the wrong.   Most guys just dismiss this when it happens, or let her have her way because its a nothing moment and it means nothing, but don't do this--if she is wrong, make sure she is capable of admitting that she can be wrong.   If she can't (especially if it's really unimportant) then you might be in for some really turbulent times.  Dating anyone who HAS to be right ALL THE DING-DONG TIME is absolutely exhausting and will murder your happiness."
AskMen,"Whatever issues they have left, though? Those are probably going to be that much stronger. >If they've conquered their demons, it can be amazing. If they haven't, watch out.   I couldn't agree with this more.  As someone who has been with two older women (1 ex, 1 current), I can tell you that this is exactly what you'll be looking at.  The Ex had a ton of issues that I tried very hard to work on, but it was too much for our relationship to handle, and inevitably ended up causing our issues.  While on the other hand, my current SO has conquered way more, though still some lingering things we have issues with.  The good part is, our bond is way stronger than any relationship I've had before, and I'm fairly confident we will continue to make it work.  But now I'm just bragging."
AskMen,"My ex had a friend over who was clicking with my brother so despite him not wanting to really party that night he said fuck it and was the DD so we could barhop.By the time we got to the last bar my ex was trashed like killing our collective buzzes cuz we had to keep taking drinks/shots away from her trashed. When it became clear we needed to just gtfo of bars, it was time to go home but she wasn't feeling that. So we're in the parking lot arguing about how she needs to sleep it off or just chill and stop drinking for awhile and the bouncer rolls up like wtf????   My brother, saint he is, runs interference with the bouncer and tries to explain the situation. Well after awhile that's not good enough and he's like fuck it I'm calling the cops if you don't get this shit under control. My bro pulls me aside and gives me the 4/11, and as I said after the last incident I was ready to dump her so with this news I'm like okay I got this. I tell the other girl what's up when she comes out looking for us and we try to get her to calm my ex down so we can dip.   Mind you I was already on the edge of dumping said ex so I talk to her friend who I was also friends with and she agrees to get my ex home safe. With that I'm like broseph let's roll.   So we go back to my place and bro out with some video games and the odd beers I had in the fridge. Half hour or so later there's a pounding on my apt. windows and I mean ALL of them, waking up my roommate who had to work in a couple hours and was quite pissed. I go talk to my ex against my better judgment and she calms down so like a retard I let her in.   She heads directly to my room then starts screaming for me. I go see what she wants and she's basically too shit faced to find the dvd she wants to watch. I find it for her, help her back into bed and even take a bit to stroke her hair, comfort her all that before I go apologize to my brother for leaving him sitting with a pause screen.   Not even 15 minutes later she comes stomping out shouting about how I've been ignoring her all night and again wakes up my roomie.  Not happy with that she knocks over our beers n shit on the living room table. I get up like WTF JUST GO TO BED! to which she replies with something like YOU CAN'T FUCKIN TELL ME WHAT TO DO and just starts swinging on me.   My roomie hears the commotion and comes out LIVID. Ex diverts her attention and charges after my roomie, CAT FIGHT ENSUES ....yay....so my brother and I break them up and I drag her out in a full nelson.   At this point my brother is like dude I'm out call me tmw and rolls out. While I've still got my ex gripped up, I have my roomie get her shit from my room. Out of ideas I have roomie call ex's mom to pick her up. Ex mom finally shows up and I basically just push her ass out the security door to my apt and never spoke to her again. Til this day she still tries to get ahold of me despite the fact I've never taken the bait."
AskMen,"Wait until after high school.  High school boys tend to have hormone problems that are difficult to control.   And take this away from this: This dude isn't necessarily a bad guy.  If you can't be around him because he can't control his desires (not in a rapey way, just in an annoying way... Although, definitely get outta Dodge if he gives off a rapey vibe), then just remember... He's just dealing with a surging of hormones.  I'm sure objectively and rationally he'd understand that unrequited  love  lust isn't the end of a friendship.  But he's neither objective or rational at this stage in his life."
AskMen,"You haven't met in person. If there's on thing I know it's anything said through text or over the phone doesn't take balls.. If you think he would expect sex the first time you guys meet you could be right. If you think he's gonna make a move for it the first time you're probably wrong."
AskMen,"I feel like there is a mindset involved as well.  I love powerfucking my girlfriend (she loves it too).  When I orgasm its good (I'm on top of the world!), hers is great(Yeah, I did good!  Who's the man and has two thumbs?   THIS GUY !).  If the tables were turned and she was giving me a blowjob I tend to have a much more powerful (and even sometimes full-body) orgasm with the drunken effect you described.  I think its the difference between being focused on giving vice being primed to receive.  When I'm actively focused on pleasing her, my arousal is less my priority and more a consequence of action.  When she goes down on me I am free of any responsibility to perform and am more keenly aware of the ebb and flow of my arousal level and just  how fucking amazing this feels .  Plus, she likes to play they long game down there so I just hold back til I can't possibly any more, at which point the release is near blackout level, which I never come close to with PIV."
AskMen,"I see this one fine lady who lives in another city from me every now and then. For whatever reason (I have several theories in development at this time), sex with her always results in mind blowing orgasms that make sex with other people pale in comparison."
AskMen,"I am 23.   In my first and only long-term relationship, I was away at college and my then girlfriend was in my hometown, about 3-4 hours away. We still saw a lot of each other and things were alright for the first 6 months to a year of the relationship.   The relationship ended after a year and a half. She had wanted out for a while, doing things like applying to be a stripper after I told her I wasnt comfortable with it. She told me she wasn't going to apply and did anyway which I later found out.   Then she had lunch with a guy who worked in the mall she worked at. She started to be friends with him and talk to him a lot. When she was over at my place once she asked me to get her phone and when I did I saw a text from him replying to her telling him that she was coming to my place tonight instead of his because I told her I would pay her gas money to come see me. Yeah I did the shitty thing and snooped, but I had the feeling. She downplayed it, said it was for his attention and that nothing had happened.   Stupid me, I believed her. She promised to break contact with him and I still dated her.   About 6 months later she started hanging out with my best friend who also still lived in my hometown. They became quick friends, and since my trust in her was shattered I didn't like it. They hung out a lot, late at night. She told me when they hung out but the extent of it I will probably never know.   At this point it was pretty unbearable. They both knew I distrusted them and made me feel like shit for it. After she told me she had feelings for him I dumped her on the spot. Whether I was cheated on I don't know, but I feel like it is most likely the truth.   It has been two years since that happened and it still feels like it happened only a month ago. Needless to say I'm still fucked up from it. I haven't had a serious relationship since and I'm afraid I will not have an easy time trusting future partners."
AskMen,"Well to me dating is complicated. I mean I believed it was straightforward in high school before I dated anyone. I thought the guy asked the girl out and then after a few dates they were considered "official".   However, my very first set of dating experiences were not straightforward at all. I unknowingly started dating 2 guys at once during a summer internship. The first guy I asked to get dinner with me because I didn't know anyone and I was desparate for a friend. It became a thing for us to hang out and i thought it was friendship but he thought it was dating (I friendzoned him because I thought I was a 2 or 3 and he was way out of my league). During this time, the second guy started inviting me to hang out with him and I didn't realize we were dating even when he bought me drinks and paid for my meal, which I reciprocated. Eventually, the second guy told me that we were dating but he had an arranged marriage so we weren't serious. At the same time, he started dating another girl, which confused me because I thought dating included exclusivity. Eventually, I broke it off with him and just dated the first guy, who had broken his an engagement a year before we started dating a week before the wedding. He was also only dating me casually but this entire time I wanted a serious relationship. This entire time I wanted a serious relationship and none of them wanted the same thing.   Sorry about the long rant/story. I was rather hurt by this experience because I felt somewhat taken advantage of and disappointed with popular media for making it all appear so simple in rom-coms and Disney movies."
AskMen,"Speech impediments can be awesome. My boyfriend - being a super premy baby - has a bit of one. He just rocks it as a Canadian accent (being born in Canada) and people don't bat an eyelid. In the seven months we've been dating I've only asked maybe twice for him to repeat himself. But it gives him a really distinct voice, and though he doesn't like it I really love the sound of his voice. Cause it's 'him'.   A little bit of therapy may help if you're struggling making yourself understood. Otherwise, just rock it."
AskMen,"Don't let your women whip you. Appreciate her and be equal with her, treat her like a queen if she treats you like a king. But do not let yourself become whipped!!   Something I've learned about some people, they're always trying to see how much they can get out of you. Made her a bagel? Expect to always make one from now on. They'll find the smallest ways to control and whip you into their bidding. It'll start with small things, like getting you to get her a cup of water, but it graduates to the point where she tries to push the bar further and further. So the lesson is to stand up for yourself, I'm not saying be a jerk, just don't be a sucker and allow her to grow lazy. Sometimes they won't even ask, they'll hand you a bag or object and expect you to put it away or hold it. Do not hold it, she's being lazy. My SO finally caught on that I was aware of her tactics, she now knows her place and never tries to push my generosity.   Whenever she gives you an excuse, and let me tell you they are filled with them, never give in to her bullshit excuse and call her out on it. Your legs are too tired to feed yourself? Man up cause you were walking fine 10 minutes ago. She'll come up with another excuse and so on so forth...  but eventually she'll learn you know better.   Anyways I'd say more but women are complicating and dangerous,  they will try and control you and manipulate you, I'd say you're better off without one, but if you train them you'll be fine."
AskMen,"I have thoughts like this sometimes where I just kind of need someone to listen to me.  Happened a lot back in college when I didn't really have anyone to talk to besides my friends (who I didn't want to spill all of my crazy on).  I would go home and sit down and just feel unfulfilled because while the people I would talk to for the most part weren't really listening, they were just waiting for their turns to talk.   I wanted to feel like someone acknowledged that they really understood, or even if they didn't that they cared enough to tell me that everything would be okay.  My best friend is excellent at this, because he and I are different, but we think the same way.  I can tell him pretty much anything and he'll have had that same thought at some point and be able to talk to me about it and make me feel like I'm not a crazy person. More recently though my girlfriend has done that and more, offering me a new perspective (rather than just my own) on how I think about things."
AskMen,"Alright, I'll post my happy story.  Not really just a today thing, but the last few months kind of thing.   My super unfaithful wife of 8 years had finally pushed me to the limit and we split.  She moved into her own apartment, I became the home parent for our three kids and began a journey to turn my life around.   I lost 40lbs and have put on some decent muscle (thanks to /r/Fitness), started dressing much nicer (thanks to /r/malefashionadvice), started taking my kids out more and being much more active with them, and also started breaking out of my shell and talking to women.   This led to me taking out a colleague of mine and so far it has been incredible!  She's super fun to be around, incredibly beautiful, awesome in bed, and the best part is she actually wants me.  May sound odd, but It's almost like I've never really known that feeling.   I got married right out of highschool to the first girl I ever kissed, she cheated on me our whole marriage and was never really that into me.   It's been the best thing, feeling wanted.  I'm going over to her place tomorrow night and I already know it's going to be awesome!"
AskMen,"To me, it has never been about the clothes or the hobbies or even the people you hang out with.   One of the most feminine and sexy girl I have ever met in my life was a girl whose jobs had been car mechanic and building painter.   It's all about the way you move and talk. This girl was walking as if she was a cat and she knew exactly how to move, talk, and act with sensuality.   It made her look extremely feminine even though she spent her weekends on a motorbike doing all sort of crazy shit."
AskMen,"I (25m) have a lot that's great right now. 6 months ago my fiancee left me and my emotional state took a dive into the shitter. I was in a bad place for a bit after it happened. Brutal depression, suicidal thoughts, plummeting grades and excessive drinking came as a result.   A couple months ago I decided to change that. Started working out 4 times a week after 2 years away from the gym and became extremely focused on becoming the best me. All of that has led up to getting in incredible shape, dating again, regularly having sex, an 85% average in university this semester, promotions at work, trying all kinds of new things I wouldn't have in a relationship and truly coming out of my introverted shell and bettering myself on a social level.   Right after the breakup I couldn't picture my life without her. Now that I'm on the path to truly finding myself and being happy, I couldn't imagine life with her. Seriously, my entire outlook on life has gone from one polar extreme to the next over 6 months and now I feel like I'm in control of my life."
AskMen,"Don't read this if your day is going well.     My friends are still awesome and completely trustworthy     My overall health.       That's about it. I can't think of anything else that's good. My boss told me we'll talk in the morning. That can't be good.   I still have feelings for my roommate. I've got the jealousy under control but I still can't fucking get her out of my head.   I'm 2 months late on rent and owe the previously mentioned roommate around $250.   I'm 19, I don't know where my life is going. I didn't even graduate highscool and I'm stuck working full time to live.   Sometimes I don't even know why I bother trying to make it work. If I found a way to off myself painlessly without a gun (Canadian), I would have already done it.   I'm a boring person to be around and I'm not outgoing, so odds are that I'll die alone. I'm basically living my life waiting for death to come around. In the meantime I escape my problems and stress by drinking and smoking weed."
AskMen,"I was dating but not really looking for a relationship when I met my SO through mutual friends. Within 3 weeks of our first date, he dropped the L word on me. To my surprise, I responded in kind (and meant the shit out of it).   We're still new as a couple, but six months in and we still can't wait to see each other every day."
AskMen,"It takes years of study and complete submersion into a woman's world to even begin to remotely understand their subtle sexual gestures, so to say the words "men don't pick up on women's subtle hints" is an unterstatement. Men don't like subtle hints, men don't pick up subtle hints, and men are annoyed by women who never give more than just subtle hints. He may want you more than drug addict wants his next fix, but too nervous to do anything or say anything. Or he just doesn't know that he's attracted to you yet. Although your hint really wasnt that subtle, he apparently did't pick it up or is too shy to make the move.   I'm not going to tell you whether or not it's a good idea to try to bone your friend but I will tell you how to get him to agree to it if you so choose: If you want to do sex with him and he's not making a move, tell him in explicit detail what you want (try not to sound like a dominatrix though), or perform the fail-safe action (my personal favorite):   Grab his dick."
AskMen,"Saw the most absolute gorgeous girl driving a white Audi TT convertible while I was jogging. I was running toward the intersection she was at, and she was at the stop light waiting to come my way. This was the light coming into my residential area so I got pretty excited to think that she at least lived close to me. The first house in the residential area had a group of kids playing basketball and while they were playing, their ball went out of bounds toward the street she was about to enter the neighborhood on. I was ecstatic;  Yes! The stars have aligned! I'm going to go get the ball and stop her enough to talk to her, all while looking fit and looking like a dude who's great with kids!  Unfortunately, the kids must have known her because as she entered the neighborhood, they were waving at her and her at them. She didn't see me and didn't hit the breaks.  BAM!  She just fucking drills me with her little TT. I broke over 20 bones in my body including my spine. I went unconscious right away, though, and woke up in the hospital with her bawling her eyes out next to my hospital bed. They wanted to see if I was paralyzed since they knew my spine was broken and asked who my insurance provider was. The girl was worried that I'd press charges but I told her not too worry about it because I was an idiot anyway for trying to get her attention and to talk to me. She smiled and we laughed, but were interrupted my the doctor who came in to let me know the costs. He said, "Well son, this here operation that will ensure that you'll walk again one day is pretty expensive. Upwards near tree fiddy K. Thankfully your insurance will cover $250,000 of it." But even better, this girl's dad happened to be a MONSTER in the business world and she piped up, "I'll cover the rest!" Now we're married and have kids in that same neighborhood."
AskMen,"At my gym they have a list of intramural sports to join. But this is at a college, I was actually thinking of getting involved in hockey and the ice rink in my town has novice lessons which seems cool. The same thing should apply for basketball as there are community centers that probably have a sign up sheet for an adult league. There are probably going to be different "divisions" (like D4 will be for the most experienced players and D1 is for the least experienced) sign up for the one that is the most appropriate. If that doesn't work use google. Just google "adult basketball for [your skill level, ie if beginner write "beginner"] in [your city's name]" and see what you find. If you live in a small town do the same thing but google for the closest biggest town."
AskMen,"i'll assume you're coming from an earnest place and i'll give as earnest a response as possible here.   feminists are called 'feminists' because their focus/emphasis is on dealing with the WOMEN'S ISSUES. otherwise, they'd call themselves 'humanists', and they don't, Bummer, :|   the 'most feminists who care' are not the ones you see in mainstream media, or the ones running the social/social-media campaigns, or the high-ranking ones or the ones who've governmental/policy-making control/power/mainstream-media-appeal. the ones who do are the rad-fem types and whether we like it or not: they're the ones calling the shots. bummer, :|.   and, i also don't particularly agree with the poisonous masculinity discussion from feminists either, :|. that's like guys discussing what type of pads/tampons are better or how it is to be pregnant. feminism/sts might not be as competent to solve men's problems as they might be, Bummer, :|.   and, most feminists or the ones calling the shots as i said above, aren't looking for equality, they're looking for 'equality': as in the equality which benefits the women, Bummer, :|."
AskMen,"It was so smooth and it made me feel so pretty, but I feel bad because I didn't mean to come off as being receptive to his affection. His comment today took me aback and I wasn't really expecting it, as before now, I've had a suspicion he was trying to flirt, but never any proof. >  but he's also the type of douchebag I've historically always fallen for and have been trying to get away from   sounds like the problem is AT YOUR END. that guy's just 'flirting with the cashier', doing repeatedly sucks but if you're not saying/doing anything to discourage it/asking him to stop, why're you blaming him?   neither did he violate your personal space or did anything excessive. he just made a funny comment on a cheesy-quote shirt a doughnut shop assistant was wearing.   > I won't cheat on my boyfriend, but I feel still guilty because I was more receptive to his compliments than I would like.   Stop absolving/deflecting blame from yourself, and learn to handle customers professionally. Or when he comes in the next time, ask him not to engage in light convo  'flirting'  with you. It's not that hard, is it?   >I'm worried that he's getting more and more aggressive about it, and while I'm not concerned for my safety I still want him to stop flirting with me. It's not progressed to the point where I need to get the police involved or anything, and I'd rather not go there unless I fear for my safety.   Police, Safety, Escalate: WAT? Lady, someone's trying to chat you up. And you've not asked him to stop. What's the deal? Take a chill-pill.   >ow do I tell this guy to fuck off within the restraints of the cashier-customer relationship?     Firstly, calm down. No wrath of god/mankind has been brought down upon you. You're just being chatted-up. Cool down and relax,     Then, find out why you're so pissed-off. Is is because you subconsciously like being chatted up like that?  "but he's also the type of douchebag I've historically always fallen for"     Once you figure that out, learn how not to 'simply fall for such banter' and act accordingly.     Then, realize if you work in retail, some customers will try to do that. It's not really illegal, and if you didn't have a bf (or even in the current scenario) you'd have been receptive.   And he's not done or said anything illegal or even assholic. You're throwing an unnecessary tantrum involving safety-concerns/police/etc. here.     Then, when he comes in again, mention your bf casually. If still he doesn't stop, ask him personally to stop that. Most probably: he will.     If he doesn't, ask your manager to talk with that guy. Do this as a last resort."
AskMen,"denigrate someone whose characteristics we all really want for ourselves.   I disagree   > Sluts are women who are sexually liberated   That depends on exactly how you define sexual liberation, or liberation in general.   >  A slut will sleep with anyone   See, now we're talking about two different things here. Someone who has "lots of great sex" is not the same thing as someone who will sleep with anyone.   > issue of sharing, attachment, etc. are a problem especially when we are younger.   This is really important, not only because you mentioned sharing and attachment, but I find that slut shaming is more prevalent in younger circles because school-aged kids are more exposed to areas of sex that are closely related to regret, bad decisions, going through "phases", bad boy/bad girl mentality, peer-pressure, establishing reputation or popularity, etc. I can speak to these things because I am fairly young (21) and I have admittedly thought less of girls in the past, not because I knew they were having sex (or even a lot of it) but because of the circumstances surrounding their character and lack of thought that went into the decisions they made.   > After all, do we not want the women we are having sex with to embody the traits of what most of us consider sluts or slutty?   No   >  Do you want a prude in the bedroom or an enthusiastic slut?   It's not a completely black/white topic.   I don't think slut shaming is cool. I don't think women should feel shameful for having and wanting sex. And I especially find it sad when a woman's desire for sex shames her to point that she doesn't feel that she can approach or be open with men. I mean, there's at least one thread a day where somebody mentions that the reason women don't approach us or initiate sex is because they don't want to appear desperate or slutty. That's sad man...things shouldn't be that way.   But people do have traits that others find undesirable. Likewise, people have traits that others might find somewhat attractive, but only in moderation. For example, I like my women a little crazy. I've dated women who when out in public with them, are calm, well-mannered, quiet, etc. But when behind closed doors, they can get a little freaky. And THEN, I've dated women on the other side of the spectrum. Women who seemed cool at first, before later discovering they had full-blown mental disorders and/or personal baggage that greatly impacted our relationship. So when I read this post, I'd think you're the kinda person that might read that second scenario and say, "Well javajam, you  said   you liked crazy chicks. Those were YOUR words! What's the deal bro!?" And to that I'd say, no! For each and every personality trait out there, there's someone who likes it, just only in moderation.   So when I think of the word slut, I don't think of a woman who has had a lot of sex. Because what does that really mean? Perhaps she's entered a lot of long term relationships and simply found that one after the other they weren't working out. Maybe they really were just brief hook-ups and she and these guys just clicked all of the sudden. Who am I to judge? I'm not dating her.   But here's the thing. When I think slut, I think records. Sexual milestones. Numbers that make you go, "Really?! She did w-what?" Back in high school it was the girl who plowed through the entire football team. In college, it was the girl who, once you walked up to her and said something as simple as "hi" you knew you were IN. Very few questions asked. Why'd she do it? You don't know. You just know it felt kinda....wrong. A slut's track record, so to speak, makes you raise an eyebrow, not because of her decision to have sex, but the circumstances around it. Remember the user who posted on reddit recently? I think it was this sub, and he asked for advice on how to calm his sister down a bit because it turned out she was bringing below average shmucks home from the bar almost EVERY night. No disrespect to that guy or his sister, but THAT'S the kind of behavior I'm talking about. The kind that makes you go, "Really... him ??? You couldn't do  any  better than that?"   With these men and women who slut shame, is it really just a deflated ego thing rather than concern about a woman's own personal and private sex life? Sure! A lot of the time it is. Either that, or the person shaming just has really negative attitudes about sex. Just read the thread currently on this sub about the kid who had to break up with his girlfriend because her parents found condoms in his bag after believing their precious daughter was some sort of innocent little flower. Can you imagine how many people in the world think like this? Then just try to imagine the kind of households their children must grow up in. When you put that into perspective, it's not difficult to see why so many grow up without seeing any wrong in shaming a woman for her desire for sex.   Socialization and gender roles, especially when they are perpetuated by the media really play role in this as well. Dating and relationships are things that MEN pursue. Getting a lot of tail is something that MEN should be doing as they get older. It's why guys get shamed for being virgins. You hear things like, "what a pussy!" or "I want a man with some experience. Someone who can be dominant and teach me a few things."   Sex on the other hand is something that many people today still believe women get DONE to them.   I had to bold that, because in my opinion, that is one of the most destructive mentalities out there in the world of dating and relationships. Sex is not something that ultimately corrupts a woman after it's over. But that train of thought is a result of that whole "Shitty lock/Master key" analogy that gets brought up on reddit once in a while:   What's better? A key that opens up ANY lock or a lock that can be opened with any key? Many would argue the former. And that's because sex is often a conquest that men venture their way through and attain, while women either accept or deny. Once men overcome that first conquest. Score! The second? You da man dawg! Third? What a stud! For women, things aren't completely equal. The progression of the perceptions people have of her once she starts having more and more sex become exponentially negative. It goes from "cool, glad she's happy" to "are you fucking kidding me?" VERY quickly. And who am I to say that's right or wrong? If you want to date a woman with little to moderate sexual history then that's fine.  If you want to date someone who you or others might consider promiscuous, then there's nothing wrong with that. That's all a matter of personal preference.   So back to that word slut. We can try to "take it back" all we want. We can try to prod people into wanting to date women who are sexually liberated. But at the end of the day, that word is still going to be used. In some circles it's going to be derogatory, and in others, it will be used as a positive term to indicate sexual liberation and comfort between couples who roleplay. What we need to teach people is not how to love sluts, but how to respect others and their individual beliefs."
AskMen,"I think the word slut means a girl who has a large number of sexual partners in succession and may not be particularly discriminating in choosing them. Not a woman who is sexually adventurous with her partner.   I don't think there's anything inherently good or bad about being a slut - it's simply a choice and as long nobody gets hurt, it's all good. However, I have noticed that possibly a majority of men don't want to date or settle down with a "slut" because they like to feel that they have been chosen specifically as an individual, rather than simply being the latest in a long and varied line. Being with a woman who is choosy can make you feel more secure as you know that she wouldn't be with you in the first place if she didn't consider you up to scratch.   The problem with the current reformation of the word "slut" is not that it tries to detoxify women's sexuality and liberate their choices, but that it tries to also tell men that they cannot dislike this characteristic in a partner. But who is anybody to tell a man what they are and are not allowed to like and dislike in a potential partner?   If any man chooses to prefer relationships with women who are faithful and relationship-focused, this seems a very reasonable preference."
AskMen,"I'm not lamamaloca, and I was brought up Baptist instead of Catholic, but my husband and I enjoy similar shenanigans, so I'll answer anyway.   Aside from the always awesome stimulation of knowing that what you're doing is driving your partner insane in a good way, there's the dominance aspect, the "this is soooo frowned upon by society but it feels so right" aspect, and the actual physical pressure on your pubic bone when thrusting."
AskMen,"Short answer: yes   Long answer: Yessssssss"
AskMen,"When I was a sophomore I decided to transfer to a public school from a private, which ended up being a pretty big life decision. Things were rough at first because I didn't know anybody, and this incident, unfortunately, coincided with that time.   For our school lunches they used to hand out these milk cartons with your meals. People would drink these, but when they were done they could be resealed, stepped on, and create a very loud popping noise.   Anyways, I had been at the school for about 3 weeks. And thankfully I brought my own lunch, as the school lunches weren't very good, but I always wanted to try stepping on one of those damn milk cartons. And one day I did. It was a beautiful milk carton, untainted by the corruption of the world, and it was mine to stomp on. So I did. Only the milk carton wasn't empty. It still popped but it just so happened to be aimed at a group of very popular girls like 15 feet in front of me. I soaked like 4 of them with milk and they all ran screaming to the bathroom. People were laughing at both of us and it was so embarrassing.   Thankfully, they were incredibly sweet about the whole thing. I apologized profusely and they just laughed it off and thanked me for being so nice about apologizing (wtf?). We all became friends throughout high school, but man was that a horrible first impression."
AskMen,"This turned into a giant wall of text, so, sorry.   Think of it like a home - you might've spent your younger years bouncing around between apartments, like the one with the cool balcony, or the one that was super close to work, etc. But then eventually, you find  a place that makes you think, yeah, I could stay here a long time, and you buy it.   It's perfect compared to all the other ones for one reason or another. The first year, it was all you could do to not be showering it with excited attention, upgrading this and that, keeping up with the gardening, feeling quite pleased with yourself as you learned which floorboards squeaked in a funny way and where to sit on the couch so the sun didn't glare out the TV. You got everything just right, and it feels like home.   After a little while, the acute joy from just thinking "house!" will go away, and there will be days where you're sitting in traffic, thinking "shit, if I'd gone for a condo in the city, I'd have been home an hour ago." Or, "if only I could swing a cottage in the middle of nowhere, I could never have to see this much traffic again." You might occasionally  slip off into a daydream about what you could've done differently, how this house has been so much work, or how you hate having to keep this mediocre job in this soul-sucking city just to pay the mortgage. Or, you think back to the glory days with the wild parties and the cheap beer and the easy tail from the cool balcony place. Whatever it is, you take a break from the truths and realities of your situation (good and bad) to derive a vicarious pleasure from the version of yourself who lives off in fantasy land and does whatever he wants with no consequences.   At the end of the day, though, you pull into your driveway, walk through the front door, plop down on the couch and take a look around. It's yours - it exacts a cost, to be sure, but it's yours - you've put the work in to make it the best fit that you can, and you really don't want to imagine your life without it. After a little while of shifting around on the couch to find your favorite glare-free sweet spot, that condo in the city or cottage in the country are just about the furthest things from your mind.   So, no reasonable person (male or female) is going to expect his/her SO to be every last little thing in the realm of possible fantasies - not any more than you could expect a modest suburban Colonial with a big yard to simultaneously be on the 45th floor of something overlooking the ocean and also in a valley shaded by mountains with no view of the neighbors. By making your home somewhere, rather than bouncing around staying this place or the other, you've accepted and embraced that. Doesn't mean you're not going to think about it, though."
AskMen,"I drank lots and lots of water, walked home (or called a cab, depending on the night in question), and slept in my own bed. Sober me woke up without a hangover (or a very small one) and was well-rested."
AskMen,"Being among other people so there is not much room to interject yourself, also having no body language in the sense of, looking up when I walk past by, or have a faint smile. Just the acknowledgement of "hey I see you" could a man make his mind up of thinking "I should say hello to this woman".   And what you say, not relationship material but friends is what in my eyes is even harder. They say it "can" happen, but I have a very hard time to befriend girls on more than an acquaintance-level, who would contact me, however my interaction with women don't seem that bad as I've got a girlfriend for a very long time.  (Maybe it is because girls are so used by being contacted all the time they don't see a need for initiating contact?)   But then again, I have very intimate (male) friends, and not everyone could say that in the first place, so I consider myself lucky."
AskMen,"Jesus Christ this thread is a dumpster fire full of hurt vaginas and closed minds.   You've done nothing wrong. She started dating you expecting you to change over time for her, eventually giving up all of the hobbies that made you who you are. Ironically, this is exactly the type of person that would then resent you because you wouldn't be the same person that she fell in love with.   She wants you to change, you're unwilling to do so. You would invite her to your hobbies, but she's likely incapable due to her stature. She wants to spend more time with you, you find the time spent with her is adequate."
AskMen,"As everyone else, I think your are not meant to be together.   You shouldn't drop your hobbies but if you love a girl, you would WANT to skip a session of your hobbies one time or an other just because you miss her.   I wouldn't say you need to prioritize her instead of yourself, but a relationship needs a good balance between how much you care of you and how much you care of her. But I think that the much important is that you must be ready to give a little bit of yourself for her and actually want to do it. If you don't, it is not even worth a try.   A relationship is sharing. Sharing interests and activities is what makes it fun. I know it may be hard to find a girl who would like same hobbies as you. The solution I have for you is to find a girl who is passionate and active as much as you are. A girl who will want to try things you like and who will make you want to try her activities.   The way you talk about sailing and how it is not possible to bring her seems like you don't even want her there and didn't even ask her. That's a big sign.   However, I perfectly understand it is hard to bring her on a boat with other people who are there to practice their sports. I suggest you to go sailing with your S/O just the two of you, so you can show her what it is and teach are the basics. If I understood well, it's look like you need more than two people to go sailing. You can ask some of your partners if they would like to help or to go dinghy sailing.   Why is it a problem that you crash at a friend's house? If his fiancee is there, you should be able to bring your lover too. When I am in a relationship, I am pleased to meet the friends of my boyfriend because it is part of himself and I want to discover his world.   Why don't you just sleep with her times to times? Even if you are tired and work next morning, the presence of the other is great and may help the relation. But she must understand that you need to sleep and you just want to feel her next to you."
AskMen,"Sounds like you value your hobbies more than a relationship which is totally fine. But I think she got pretty rude at blowing up at you for assuming you'd make more time for her despite you telling her ahead of time how much value you place on hobby time."
AskMen,"I'm actually 22 and still a virgin - I'd prefer my next S.O. (or even wife) to know that I held out and saved my virginity for her and her alone. There's no shame in being a virgin, ESPECIALLY when you realize that eventually all that stuff in your past'll come to light.     I'm pretty insecure in social settings and somewhat introverted, but realize that when I vest myself in others (talking to them, hearing them out), I make friends and earn trust easily.     I've been struggling through depression and have only recently started seeing a counselor. Sometimes you can't fix all the bad that's potentially inhibited your personality/growth, but sometimes talking to someone about it  truly  helps.     Future/Intelligence? I'm a 5th year comp. sci. major longing for the company of my friends and family while away at school. I dropped the ball hard all throughout my college career (even now), and just want to be done. I've had a successful internship, am an intern at a CS start up right now, and have a job lined up when I graduate because I kept getting back up, putting myself out there, making connections, and trucking on. I kinda believe in "brute forcing" things: I ain't the smartest, but if I keep pushing something's gotta give.       I'll be honest -- there have been days I haven't even left bed because I have felt empty inside, or at least severely unmotivated. When my friends and family show pride in me, it hurts because I know that I survive by the skin of my teeth and get lucky as all get out. This is not me telling you to "suck it up"; this is my saying that sometimes it's impossible to not worry, particularly when facing the now, and  especially  when facing the future. My only advice is to just push: put yourself out there and don't say  no  because you're afraid to fail. This past summer was hell for me working ~50 hours and driving ~180 miles  a week  to juggle between job opportunities to bolster my resume and skill set. If someone told me I would try that kinda shit 3 years ago, I would tell them I'm more sensible than that. There's no use trying to predict the future, and sometimes your anxieties will get the better of you. But sometimes if you try, even put in the  least  effort that you can even muster, it's more than the other guy was willing to put in, and that's what wins.   I'm not endorsing being lazy or saying depression is a crutch -- just that anxiety, lack of motivation, etc. are more common than you realize. You have no idea how the future or even the next couple of minutes is gonna go, so don't sweat it or you might be inhibited by indecision and guilt over circumstances that haven't even happened. And as for friends? They'll come and go, and I'm blessed to say that while my friend circle has grown smaller over the years, I've found who my best friends are. It's all about humility yet still standing for you sore beliefs. That's all I got, and I'm sorry for the length."
AskMen,"If I'm out at a party or I'm just outside around campus (university) it'll happen at least once. That being said, I enjoy it and aside from the ego boost I like to keep it going until the girl breaks it.   In middle school when I used to be a mall rat I was walking around with my cousin just hanging out at the mall. I saw this group of 4 girls walking in our direction and the one in front was really cute so I was looking at her and caught her looking at me. We kept eye contact and actually turned around after we walked by eachother while not breaking it. Fast forward I got her number, didn't really click so she gave me her friends number for some reason, and then I started "dating" some other girl very shortly after so that was the ended of that."

AskMen,"I'm you ten years later. I have three suggestions, which I think help to varying extents, though I still struggle to have trust in my own sense of judgement.     Push back. The world is full of people with opinions, but that's all they are. Most men who suffer from this give a lot of weight to other's opinions, even above their own opinion. Practice doing little things that you feel good about but that someone else doesn't like. This helps develop that inner sense of knowing that you are a good person and acting with integrity even if someone else thinks you are being a jerk.     Work on the self-love piece. I know this is hokey and cliche, but ask yourself why you aren't more gentle with yourself, more caring. Why so critical? Why don't you treat yourself with more compassion? You're doing just as well as some, better than others. Everyone has room for improvement. Developing that sense of compassion about yourself and your own struggles will help.     Go somewhere where you are alone. Spend some time, and get a sense for what your choice is. You will want to revisit it when you get back in touch with other people, but try not to, because that answer you arrived at when alone is probably the right one.       If you're like me, you know what the right choice for you is, but you're worried about what other people will think of you if you make that choice. You worry about what they think about the choice you made. You can too easily see their perspective, and that makes you feel confused and unsure."
AskMen,"The way I see it, if you two had a healthy relationship, he should essentially already be well aware of everything that you would be saying.   Personally, I've found it's easiest to get over a breakup by simply not communicating with my ex. I considered both of my ex-girlfriends to be my best friend during our relationships. Losing a best friend is  extremely  tough. You don't ever want to lose an important, meaningful friendship. But looking back, I have no regrets about my decisions to completely cut contact post-breakup. I'm all but certain that any sort of continued contact would have only drawn out the pain of the breakup and made it take even longer to move on.   You also said you're moving to a different state. Trying to maintain that friendship over a long distance will be challenging just as a long distance relationship is. Doing so while dealing with the pain of a breakup will only make it tougher.   ("

self,"I wish I had more time to comment on this. But I read what you wrote about God, and I just wanted to put my two cents in. I am a Christian, and a firm believer in God. Now, before you engage in cynic mode. Let me explain my views, as they are very...liberal. I believe in God, and I call him God and I view Him/Her through Christian eyes. However, I do not agree with what a lot of strict Christians think. I simply do not believe that God would punish, and send non-Christians to hell. How is it an innocent childs fault that he/she was born in a non-Christian family, and never baptized or whatever. How could God send that child to hell? Even more so, how could God send a wonderful, faithful Muslim, Buddhist, [Insert Religion Here], to hell? I simply do not believe that a fair and just God would send a good person to hell just because that don't call God...God! I believe that many people do things in God name that He would not approve of. That is the thing with Religion. We start wars, persecute people, and judge others all in the name of it. What I believe people should believe in is Faith. The idea that there is something bigger than us, and that there are somethings we can't answer no matter how hard we try. For example, What happens after we die? We simply can not know. Because well, once people die that can't exactly give us the science, or spiritual from the other side. For, now this is all I can write, feel free to comment and I will try to get back to you as soon as I can! Because to be perfectly honest I would love to hear your views. I am a scholar and constantly in  pursuit of knowledge!   Edit: Just kind of to give you insight into your whole post, and not go off on a Religious tangent.... It is absolutely excellent that you question yourself, and your views. That is how you grow. If you didn't argue and debate and hear views that differ from your own, how could conclude that your views are right for you. A lot of people don't understand that concept. If you stick your head in the sand when someone with a different view is expressing it you will never learn. And I am not sure if you live in the USA, but that is the problem with our government system. We are so bi-partisan. What started out as way to safeguard the people has ended up in a giant clusterfuck where adults squabble like children, and refuse to compromise. They have lost sight of the people, and the big picture. Oh, Lord, here I am rambling again! Sorry! Just thought I would express my thoughts too!"
self,"I do understand how it slips, and most of the time I ahve other things to worry about.  But yeah I do get offended.  Let me share a story.  My bosses are both very conservative, however, they have no problem with me being gay.  So lady boss was always saying "that's GAY," and then gave me shifty nervous eyes like I'm a whit elephant in the room.  Or a pink elephant.  With glitter.  Anyway.  One day was kind of rough for me, and at a meeting, the question was asked, "Why didn't So-and-so buy the product?" She said, "Cuz he's GAY," and then gave me the shifty nervous eyes.  I put down my pen and notepaper and looked her square in the eye and told her, "you have to quit saying that."  Man boss told me to quit being so sensitive, and I said, "You'd be sensitive too if you were walking home one night and some guy beats the shit out of you because he correctly perceived that you're gay, all the while hurling gay insults to you."  Then I turned to lady boss and said, "Every time you say that around your kids, you're normalizing to them that it's okay look down at people, to make fun of them, because they're gay."  So that was that.  They've never said it again."
self,"Introduction: I'm a PhD student that's sort of going nowhere. I've been in school for 12 full years now with no set end in sight. I've walked more miles in your shoes than you have, and we both know those shoes suck.   Last year, I got into a unicycle accident during the most intense week of the year. Granted, I don't know how to ride unicycles, but just one second before the accident I was riding a  bicycle  at high speed over a curb to avoid pedestrians on my way to take an exam early so I could go be a best man at a wedding that was scheduled on my birthday that weekend before a business/research trip to Seattle. Basically, a broken collarbone and a trip to the emergency room happened at the worst possible time for me. I still managed to make it to the wedding and deliver a kickass speech, and now I get to tell  the most amazing garter toss story ever to people I meet who need an introduction to truly how crazy of a character I am . I stayed at home while my mom took care of me for a few extra days, but I was a sad sack of shit while I was healing instead of feeling relaxed and relieved that I got away from the stresses of everyday life.   While the break was certainly welcome despite the fact that it fucked up things for a lot of people who were depending on me, I  DO NOT RECOMMEND  severe trauma or hospitalizations as a way to disconnect from everything. Things will still be waiting for you when you get back. Responsibility does not disappear just because you do.   I DO recommend  completely  disconnecting from EVERYTHING for a week. It takes a little effort (which I realize isn't easy to get when you're feeling the way we do) to get everything lined up and ready to take a week off, and it may increase the amount of debt you're piling on already, but your mental health is more important. As long as you can afford food and a place to live, let the student loan debt pile up for another week.   I recommend you go camping in the mountains for a bit. If you go camping to try to disconnect your mind, bring a cell phone for emergencies but DO NOT USE  ANY  electronic devices during your trip. I just did a 10-day motorcycle trip with a friend and he brought his cell phone and it sorta ruined his ability to let go and actually be on vacation, and as a result screwed up my ability to be at peace with and live with the uncertainty of everything going on elsewhere but there. You don't need to know how your favorite sports team is doing or what's going on on Facebook when you're communing with nature.   I also recommended visiting /r/howtonotgiveafuck for some advice on how to let things go and make peace with your mind."

self,"Let's ignore the 'fishing up tons of pussy' objective TRP generally gives, like I say I dislike the tons of misogyny. But in terms of social truths, it has a valid point which I discuss elsewhere: the self-esteem movement is counter-intuitive to self-improvement. Liking yourself does not make you a better, more interesting, better-looking, richer, more talented funnier person. It. Just. Doesn't. Liking yourself prevents you from sinking into depression, avoids terrible health and lets you sleep peacefully at night. That's it.   TRP lists a whole lot of other stuff which I could be doing, some which would be painful, like excepting that my body type is just not that attractive to the vast majority of women and most men see me as a runt because of it. If I am prepared to suck it up and swallow my pride (with that little top point of the pill), objectively I am likely to go much further in life."
self,"Well again, I have always understood that one of the components to success socially is to not let others into how you feel. This requires emotional self-control. So, you can feel scared, but act happy. When you fail to do this, you lose friends.   Let me clarify: without negative or intense emotions getting in the way. And basically, if you have felt a lot of nice (or not so nice) emotions but haven't achieved anything, you're not much of a man, or anyone.   Aside from the dark triad (which is admittedly manipulative and icky), I don't know how TRP would promote anything more than very hardened stoicism after a period of bitterness.   Also, a lot of what TRP and PUA promotes is the ability to connect one's thoughts and emotions with one's behaviour, not compromised by feelings such as approach anxiety, nor by what people are saying (which, compared to what people do, is usually manipulative)."
self,"Here's something to think about; a basic A.A. degree is basicly the "bs" classes from a 4 year degree. In other words, when you want to become an engineer, you still need a couple English classes, diversity credits, etc. (I'm in school for engineering, and I've taken World Music, Economics, Psychology, and English literature classes.)   Is there a community college in your area? I would recommend a meeting with a counselor. You don't need to commit to college, but talk to someone. Tell them you want to progress your life, but aren't sure how. Take classes that you haven't been able to experience before.   Personally, I considered a career in economics. I took one class, and realized it wasn't for me. But my psychology class, unplanned, almost caused a career change. I would've never guessed that.   What I guess I'm saying is, an A.A. degree let's you try out college, while earning credits that apply for practically any degree, and gives the opportunity to learn what YOU like."
self,"Ok. A couple of guys have answered below, but I will add my observations too.   a. All people need 7-8 hours of sleep, daily, no matter what(unless you have seriously changed the pattern over a few months by taking naps in between).  Right now you have indicated that your sleep pattern is highly variable. Some days you sleep at 12, others 10, wake up at 5.30 or sometimes 7.30 or sometimes later. I think that's the problem right there.  How am I guessing? I've observed a lot of friends(you know, the guys who skip classes playing WoW all night) and they had similar sleeping hours. Sometimes they would spend the entire night playing. Sometimes they would sleep at night while others are playing.  Som my recommendation is that you sleep and get up at the same time every night, with deviation ONLY once or twice a week. This means bed at 10 and getting up at 5.30 no matter what(excepting your weekend smashes, which, are too long). You do mention that you take naps, so it is possible to get little sleep using a concept called 'Power naps' where you sleep 20 mins every 5 hours or something.  I don't think you want to do that, so try not to nap during the entire day, and you should fall asleep when you're tired.  I'm trying to say: Awake all day + no naps = tired body = sleep at night.  A few have suggested cutting down on suppplements, well I don't know much about them, but yeah, they might be keeping you awake, so as one guy says try taking them in the morning.   As for diet, you mention that you eat regularly, so I don't think that is a problem. Eating too little also can cause sleep deprivation."

bestof,"Well, in the US freedom of speech is about limiting both a priori restraint and after the fact punishment.  You are correct in that a priori restraints are heavily disfavored.

bestof,"Whatever slice you look at, business interests dominate, with an overall advantage over organized labor of about 15-to-1.   >Even among PACs - the favored means of delivering funds by labor unions - business has a more than 3-to-1 fundraising advantage. In soft money, the ratio is nearly 17-to-1.   It seems to me that these figures back up exactly  what I'm saying.   They do bring up a good point; that the  only  thing even close to corporate cash on the left is union money, and of course one of the biggest movements since Cato, Heritage, et al began is the decline and demonization of unions in America.   Mission Accomplished.   Look, I'm not arguing that the left should be taking a similar approach.  In fact I have been making that argument since the 70's.  But, with each passing year I have also watched the growth of corporate money in politics.  I have watched our supposed "party on the left" become more and more right wing in order to win elections under the  system the right has set up."
bestof,"The problem is that the majority of people crying out against CISPA haven't even read the bloody thing and are just parroting what is told to them. They hear things like "no more privacy" and shout that CISPA means that the 4th Amendment no longer works, even though they have been signing away their privacy to all these companies all this time. Google knows the contents of all your emails, knows who your friends are, your favourite porn star and all your hobbies. Facebook knows where you went, who you broke up with, and how many duckface pictures you made. And people want to complain about CISPA?   The people here keep comparing SOPA with CISPA, even though these are completely different bills, where quite honestly the only similarity is that it pertains to the internet. CISPA has been written with input and support from Google, Facebook, Yahoo etc. People keep asking "WHY?" and point at these companies for their hypocrisy. They have absolutely no idea how politics work, because this is called COMPROMISE. CISPA is something that these companies can control, because it is what they have been doing all this while. CISPA puts power into the companies hands, because they can choose the kind of information that gets sent to the government in the event of "cyber-terrorism". The very fact that "cyber-terrorism" is defined in an ambiguous manner means that there can be opportunity for delay tactics if the need arises.   So many people have no ability to see the bigger picture, or think for themselves, or learn to understand how things work. CISPA is bad, but only bad in the sense that all government legislation is "bad". CISPA is a step in the right direction after what happened with SOPA. The bill is unlikely to pass eventually, but it sends a message to the lawmakers that the tech companies are willing to cooperate, calming fears of a repeat of the SOPA blackout. Eventually, the lawmakers will make more compromises to the tech companies, and everybody will be happy. Except for the butthurt neckbeards who want to complain about everything while sitting in their basements doing nothing."
bestof,"With regards to Obamacare and death panels, the SOPA debacle had a similar amount of FUD with respect to the argument that the government was going to take the internet away if SOPA passed.  The funny thing was that to protest a perceived attack on internet freedom (or free shit), websites shut down anyway.   French Transportation strikes are related in that nobody really cares what French transportation workers want, they are just annoyed that transit has shut down again and again.  Repeated political internet shutdowns would have the same effect.   Tying them both together, you can and will end up with a situation where websites are being blacked out to "protect" the internet, when in fact the people attacking the internet are those blacking it out.  At that point nobody cares what you are protesting about because you are the ones getting in the way of the flow of information on the internet.  And all of this under the aegis of the government trying to take the internet away from us."

bestof,"The Nationalist and Labour parties stem back from the time when Malta was British colony.   The Nationalist Party (PN) was formed by a group of Maltese who felt that Malta was spiritually Italian.  Their battlecry was the opposition of the Anglicization of Malta by the British.   The PN had the support of many of the older, richer families who were themselves of Italian descent.  The Labour party was formed from a labour union of government workers under the British government.  Originally, the supporters were pro-British,  blue collar workers and was always proudly "anti-intellectual".   Around the time of Malta's independence Malta had a healthy democracy.  However, the political landscape was destroyed when Labour's Mintoff came into power in 1971.  After failing to get Malta integrated with the UK,  he started advocating isolationist ideals,  claiming that the West was no friend of Malta, and looking towards the likes of Gaddafi, Caucescu and Kim il sung to fund the social reforms which he greatly desired for Malta.  He also bled every cent he could out of the small middle class,  creating a massive brain drain. He set up a control economy for Malta,  with prices of everything fixed.  While Malta had excellent social services,  everything else was razed to the ground.  What's worse: over 50% of Malta was working in the public sector!  Talk about unsustainable.   The political landscape was polarised:  lower classes that benefiting Labour's policies would vote Labour for life.  Those snubbed by Labour would vote PN.   In the middle were those few genuine thinkers,  and many opportunists.  No other parties were relevant.   Entire families were labelled by their political colour,  and that would determine whether they would get that job,  or whether you would get that operation you need,  or that building permit.   Eventually, the Labour party fell out of favour.  Not for the disastrous foreign policy,  but due to internal wrangling in the party.   In  1984 1987  the Nationalist party won the election. However,  political clientelism remained, just as bad as it ever was,  and under that thin veneer of first-worldedness you'll find the Sicilian Mafia mentality of "you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours".   Somehow they managed to get re-elected for 25 years. Now, in 2013,  Labour are back in power,  and after the initial relief of seeing new faces in charge,  naive fools  like me are realising that the shameless cronyism and corruption is still as strong as ever.  We're now part of the EU, and while we should be more empowered than ever,  it seems we're no more intelligent.   Forget talking political ideology,   long term plans for the country,  we're going to haggle over whether the price of electricity goes down by 10 euros,  or whether kids should be given free ipads at school."
bestof,"Using "they" as a gender-neutral personal pronoun is still technically incorrect and improper.   "He or she" is the correct way to address a person of yet-undisclosed gender.   Perpetuating "they" as a singular personal pronoun is like people using "literally" so much that it's starting to ironically become the opposite meaning ("figuratively," in a hyperbolic way).   I think Oxford's Dictionary has been considering adding a definition to "literally" to mean something along the lines of "an exaggeration of the term 'figuratively.'"  Obviously, we don't want that to happen.  I can't think of a synonym for "literally," so if that word gets redefined into "figuratively," then I wouldn't know how to substitute any words for "literally."   Edit/"
bestof,"What I was trying to say in regard to the first point you disagree with is that many "liberal types" (I really don't like to use these collective terms because everybody is different but I hope you know what I mean) are already on board that  some  government programs can be bad and destructive. My experience is that if people arrive at libertarianism it is the social programs like welfare and public education that are the most difficult ones for people to let go of intellectually so to speak. This is my explanation for why most people who don't agree with things like welfare tend to be libertarian (though not always): if they no longer believe in welfare they've probably previously already given up their support of most other programs which inevitably puts them either at the libertarian position or leaning that way.   I agree with you that poverty is inherently arbitrary and ideas of poverty change over time (a person considered living in poverty in the USA today would be considered wealthy compared to a person living in poverty in the Sudan) but this doesn't really make a case against the argument. All the poverty statistics come from the government and government's are the people who decide what threshhold constitutes "poverty"... using their own metrics their own social programs have failed but personally I don't even believe somebody who has a roof over their head and food should be considered in poverty at all. But that's a personal thing, I realise setting an arbitrary line can be useful for some purposes.   I don't think I said that libertarianism is increasing, can you point to where I did say that? Either way I  do  believe it is increasing but I also agree with you that socialist (or perhaps "anti-capitailst") views seem to be on the rise. I don't think these things are mutually exclusive. As various countries like the USA and the UK begin to get into worse situations the people recognise that something is wrong. As discomfort increases people look for answers. In that climate people could move towards libertarianism  or  socialism from their previous position of not really paying attention which would mean both movements would gather steam.   In my opinion history shows socialism doesn't work and freedom does, just from a practical stand point. I also happen to think there is a moral argument that convinces me libertarianism is the consistent and right position, but I know a lot of people are more persuaded by utilitarian arguments and to those people I think honest examination of economics, history and philosophy leads to the conclusion that libertarianism is far better than redistribution/regulation/controls etc.   Just to reply to something you said to shaurz   >A well educated, well informed populace is the best protection against tyranny. There are people who will be brainwashed by whoever attempts to brainwash them (the state, the media, their teachers, whoever) and those who will not. Those who will not are still better off with the education.   Many libertarians (and certainly myself) would argue that the state does the opposite of educating people. Rather it kills creativity, teaches a lot of meaningless facts and biased pro-state history, completely fails to promote critical thinking or economics which are critical in order to form coherent political opinions... the list goes on. And this isn't an opinion either, the facts speak for themselves: the state has been spending more and more over the past 30 years whilst at the same time graduating less and less educated kids. Many children are coming out of  12 years  of state education without the ability to even read or write properly. At the same time private institutions, which are competing with something that is  being given away for free  (always a difficult task) are educating kids to a far higher standard for  less than half the cost .   People often talk a lot about how Sweden shows how socialism is a good thing, but the truth is Sweden actually has more of a free market in education than the United States: in Sweden the government does give money to parents for their kids education but the parents can decide which private school to send those kids to. The UK on the other hand shares the USA model. As a UK resident I recently spent some time in Sweden and the difference between intelligence in the young people was scary. Simply allowing free markets and  choice  for parents quickly and radically improves education."
DotA2,"There are many players to learn from if you're new, but how many of them stream? I can't tell. I myself wouldn't say I'm too bad at this game. I have alot of experience in these games and knows more or less what to do and what not to. But watching my stream to learn as a newbie wouldn't probably be the best considering i usualy do moves that i KNOW aint good, but i do them anyway because i cba to sit in base and just wait, or because i more or less find the most fun in Dota2 when the adrenaline starts pumping. Im more of a player that finds the spots to enter the fight but have no idea where the exit is nor the outcome. I usualy take fights where the odds aint to our favour, just beacuse if i win the fight or survive long enough i get that good feeling."
DotA2,"But the chain frost example isn't really right - the team with the lich chose a shitty place to fight, or didn't have enough aoe to clear out the creeps before dropping his ulti. That's a gameplay or picking failure (or success, depending on who made the good/bad decision/forces the fight)   Similarly, soul catcher is incredibly potent, and has that enormous aoe to glance it out. You do realise that it works through disruption, right? That landing the skill correctly is one ofthe pitfalls of it being so balls out insanely strong?   Neither of those are random, they are gameplay and skill enablers. Bash I can get behind, evasion I can get behind, axe's fucking ridiculous helix I can get behind, but none of the things you suggested are remotely close to random, and if they are being random, you're just playing badly.   Tiny is the only thing you suggested that is even a little bit right, but people still consistently manageto Ava/toss and instant kill people repeatedly, by getting their positioning right. If it were any easier to do, he'd be borderline imbalanced."
DotA2,"Luck is a factor in all games and society in general. An element of randomness keeps things interesting. If you think you lost a game because one Void got a lucky bash on his first try, then the truth is you probably had a dozen fundamentally controllable opportunities to keep that from being the deciding factor. No single element is ever the sole reason for winning or losing, but randomness can create more unique experiences and memories.   For neutrals, I think there's a valid argument for creating more predictability in their spawns to improve jungling viability.   Runes are only as random as you let them be. With proper ward coverage the spawns and benefits of a rune become highly predictable. Take advantage of your resources (wards) to insulate yourself from getting ganked by a "lucky rune.""
DotA2,"Every aspect of the game that you mentioned contains variability, but it's up to a player and his teammates to play in a manner that drives the advantage given by such randomness in their favor.   For example, bash on Void has a 25% chance to proc. However that's not the end of the story. A void with MoM doesn't have the same chance to proc his bash as a void without MoM. You get IAS items to drive up your opportunities at achieving the 25%. If a void wants to go crit instead of IAS, that's totally acceptable. But the player has made a tactical choice to opt for criticals rather than the power to attack faster and use the availability of this 25% to his advantage.   The very heroes that you mention are very good reasons why an element of randomness should remain within the jungle. When you pick Chen instead of Enchantress, you are doing so with the understanding that you will not be able to dominate more than 1 creep at a time until level 5. The reason Enchantress was so popular to Na'Vi at one point was because she could dominate  two  as opposed to Chen's  one . They were giving up Chen's other utilities to increase the chances that they could come out of the jungle at a very low level with a disabling creep (whether it was 1 of 2, or 2 of 2 dominated creeps.) In other words, actively shaping the game's randomness to favor their strategy.   Randomness also tests players. Will a darkseer that comes across a golem camp simply wait for someone else to kill it and lose out on more efficient jungling? (Having to walk around the camp everytime.) Or will he pull, stack, and choke point to give himself access to the resources presented by golems? The same can be said for the Doom. If the ideal X camp isn't readily available, what sort of creep will he pick up to optimize his capacity to tank, stun, slow, or mana drain.   Finally, I feel like runes  need  to be random. The simple fact that a player doesn't understand how or why a rune might hurt their lane or team drives them to pick it up/prevent the other team from grabbing it. When the enemy mid goes missing, compare how much incentive there is for a player and his side lanes to react if 1)he doesn't know whether it was top or bottom, whether it was a haste or invis or double damage, versus 2) he already knew it was an illusion rune top. A rune is far more dangerous to a team if they don't know what it is until it's being used on them. This danger is what drives team to fight so heavily over runes (and ultimately, what makes them integral to the game.)"
DotA2,"in my limited experience i find that learning the game first and getting your general mechanics down is a lot more important than learning individual heroes. if you have a good general knowledge of skill interactions and skill usages(which you can obtain from both playing against certain heroes and with certain heroes on your team, i.e. by not necessarily playing the hero itself) and decent mechanical skill, then playing a hero you've not played before becomes a LOT easier.   personally i just played the heroes i liked playing, and occasionally when i went out of my comfort zone with heroes i hadn't played before i still did pretty well as the general mechanical skill and game knowledge i'd built up from say, my first game as enigma(the first hero i played) to my first game as jakiro(couple days ago) made both experiences completely different and i played a pretty semi-decent jakiro."
DotA2,"I rage all the time.  It's part of the process.  I've gotten really good at not showing it in game even if someone else is because I found if I at least ignore where my rage is targeted we can get over faster as a team and finish the game with a better chance of a win.   When I'm raging because of a troll rager I bottle it up for a special day where I social engineer their residence and then plan my next trip that goes by them accordingly.   I give myself a good two days maybe three to case their place and prepare.  Before I ditch I break in silently and kill them then disappear.  It helps me actually stand the ragers knowing I will kill them.  Not like valve does shit about people telling others to kill themselves and whatnot.  Gotta take punishment into my own hands if they ain't doin shit.   Joking aside mute button and play my shit is what I do.  Teammate fucked up?  Not like I haven't!  Also people get mad about the time they "invest" going to a loss.  You're gunna play tons more games so what design one hour mean?   5 people walk away investing their time into a loss every game"
DotA2,"Stop playing.  Seriously, take a break for awhile and come back with a fresh mind.  I very rarely rage when I game, but for some reason, FIFA on 360 has cost me several controllers and headsets...even up to the point where I had thrown my actual console across the room.  Yeah.   I come from a very competitive background including playing professionally for a short stint (BF2), so I can understand getting frustrated when yourself or someone on your team performs far less than desirable.  Honestly, once you get to the point where you're constantly raging, there is no point in playing.  For one, no matter what you do, you aren't going to find enjoyment in playing.  Secondly, as mentioned already, when you rage, one typically plays worse and makes stupid mistakes which only induce even more rage.   So, back to the original statement.  When I would find myself getting overly irritated with FIFA, I would take a break ranging from a couple days up to a few weeks.  That typically allowed me to come back and enjoy myself again, and I usually played significantly better when I would come back too.   If it's the language barrier that is driving you crazy (which I really don't think that is the overlying issue), then find a few friends to queue up with."
DotA2,"The difference between tachyons and a black hole is that while both are hypothetical, a black hole has support through deduction. Tachyons don't even have that. I mean essentially everything we cannot immediately observe is considered just a theory, but most of our science past that point is extrapolated by taking said theory as truth. While the black hole may technically be hypothetical, it has backing and we've advanced with that assumption, and everything still follows the laws of physics. A tachyon on the other hand has no support, no true contribution, as well as a direct violation of the laws of physics."
DotA2,"I completely agree with you that Tree is underutilized. However, I think that his tower healing ability is not as effective in the pro-scene as it is in the pub-scene.   Think about pro games you watch. T1s are often given up fairly easily and we accept that these will likely go down without an extreme fight most of the time. The T2 and T3 towers are what matter most, and often the pushes against those towers are 5 man unrelenting pushes. They aren't the kill half the health and leave pushes that happen more in pub games. They take the entire tower and Tree wouldn't be able to save them."
DotA2,"Ok i read the whole thing and my god I see no reason to ever run Kotl, Nyx and PL in a trilane like they said and here are the reasons why.   At level 1 you have mana burn which costs 130 mana, kotl which has chakra that returns only 75 mana, and lance on PL. At level 1 you can do absolutely nothing, and if the enemy goes on you can do absolutely nothing. They say you should mana burn early because of chakra but it takes 2 chakras to cast 1 mana burn, thats 50 of kotls mana, 38 seconds of cd for 1 mana burn...   Lets do a little theory craft here your trilane against a Lina, SD, Sven trilane. Anyone on your team gets disrupted they are dead you have no way to break the initation, you have 0 stun, 1 mana burn nuke which will not burn enough mana to stop the initiation and 1 slow nuke that do nothing whatsoever, if nyx got impale at 1 you would at least have a stun so your lane might not die repeatedly but since they want mana burn your trilane will get raped before kotl has illuminate.   What is the point of putting nyx and pl in the same lane with kotl. Kotl can at best keep one of their mana up early game, not both and certainly not both while trying to keep his up enough to chakra both of them. This lane has very little kill potential, you cant even spam spells until kotl is at least level 3 which in a trilane that is not getting kills is like 7 mins in the game.   To me its just a horrible horrible lane. Can someone please explain what im not understanding that makes this a good lane? I mean it could be decent against a solo laner but nyx kotl or nyx pl would do just as well without gimping themselves on levels. I just dont understand how or why this is considered a good trilane especially one they claim is good against other trilanes. It works on paper cuz on paper kotl is a "mana battery" and the other 2 are mana intensive so they have synergy but like i said early game kotl cannot sustain 2 heroes and certainly not 2 heroes plus himself so your stuck waiting till level 3. And if you wait till 3 at the earliest to start doing things with your trilane youve already lost. I just dont see this ever working in a real game against competent players."
DotA2,"Imo you should stick with some easy supports for now like lich,lion and try to learn from your teammates or enemies (or just from the overall match),try and remember what skills the heroes have and what they can do with those.Dota (and all things for that matter) is basically a trial and error thing,you learn from your mistakes,but to not get flamed and all,try and learn from 1-2 mistakes.   Go from 2-3 heroes and add from that,i dont think all random is a good idea,you will get overwhelmed with information and nothing will stick in the long term."
DotA2,"Don't worry about letting down your team. If you lose, your team will be more than happy to find a scapegoat.   If that happens to be you, regardless if you deserve it or not, just be aware thar you're not "wasting their time", because you aren't. If they feel like they're wasting their time by losing, it's their own fault for keep playing the game without a 100% winrate.   If they'll blame you for the loss, there are to was you can think of it. One would be that you're doing them a favor by keeping their delusion of being perfect alive, or that they're simply morons for blaming you for the loss.   Regardless of what you enjoy about this game, losing is part of it. If youo cannot accept that, you have problems, not the guy you accused of being the sole reason for the loss."
DotA2,"Playing hard support is a really good way to get comfortable faster, in my opinion.   Not in pubs. To play hard support you need to have confidence that your carry is going to take advantage of it what you're doing and that your team is going to actually cooperate with you. What mostly happens is you're blamed for everything that goes wrong and flamed for only having boots 1 and mek at 20 minutes (EDIT: because your team doesn't want to follow up on a frostbite on an isolated carry and will wait for the rest of the enemy team to turn up, rape your face, and then role the rest of your team 5v4). ESPECIALLY at lower levels.   While support is a good choice to learn the game, Hardcore warding/stacking/harrassing bitch will just lead to boredom and frustration.   Source: Attempted hardcore support in shit-tier pubs."
DotA2,"against a team like that i don't know what you can do. But if they are a 5 man who don't just pick an unbelievably strong team just say to your team "right guys lets pick a decent team and fuck this wannabe stack over". usually this incites the will to play as a team into your team.   Seriously though pl ko"
DotA2,"Soul burn is good for delaying their carry's critical mass. If you and a teammate or two catch an anti-mage alone in the jungle, he's food without blink. However, after he's done farming and grouped up with the rest of his backup, silencing him isn't gonna stop him from right clicking away. By that point, you'll need hex to completely shut him down.   Additionally, try to take advantage of the timing before their carries farm up BKB or manta, after which soul burn will only be effective on the other casters on their team."
DotA2,"Everything in dota depends on the situation.  You need to decide for yourself which will be more effective.  This will depend on a number of different factors: how long will it take to farm, what does the team need from me during the farm up time, what's the enemy composition.   Because of the way bloodstone works the best time to get it is right before you are going to be involved in a lot of ganks/kills and can survive.  Therefore you may need to get an orchid before Bloodstone both to secure kills and survive.  The main thing to remember about Bloodstone is that it doesn't really do anything for you to help secure a kill, but will allow you to continue your killing.  So if you can kill and survive w/o an orchid then get a bloodstone.  If you get your orchid and are still in danger of getting killed then focus on sheepstick or bkb   edit:"
DotA2,"Most situations when I feel the need to use my reports I report multiple people for jointly flaming/trashtalking. My last game tonight I played with 4 individuals speaking an unknown language (not english) which would've been great if they didn't spend all the game chatting in this unknown language. Of course I had the option to mute them, thus hindering any communication, and kindly tell them to talk in English; but in the end this is (in my opinion) what reports are for. But with only 4, and now 2 reports per week, I'm not gonna be able to report anything waiting for that inevitable game with a ridiculous flamer. If anything, this reassures me that I can flame on as much as I want because most people won't have reports left."
DotA2,"Valve wanted DOTA2 to "be about community" since the start.   Lies and "Promises" about mentor systems, and prizes for helping newbies learn the ropes.   The entire game's been "OMG NOOB LION" and "NOOB THIS" and "NOOB THAT" with a terrible tutorial that encourages autoattacking, using mana on creeps when blatantly not required, and so forth. Valve finally realizes - this genre has the worst community short of <not mentioning because the backlash would corrupt the thread>. Stackers ruined that whole notion - and they're catering to the people most likely to spend a dollar on some stupid codpiece for Lina - the solo player(s)! This game's no longer about community at all, beyond the Steam Community market."
DotA2,"I say to smurf because if they are that bad at hooking then they might work in the company they are in as opposed to playing in high/ vhigh MMR games where they will be destroyed and called out for ruining games.   I know its a dick move o smurf but in this instance you are putting your self at that level because that is where the skill you are playing with in this circumstance.   Bots are good too, but they are so polarized, some will stand still and let you walk into position in front them and hook, and then others will somehow know your perfectly timed hooks through fog of war. Real people are the best to practice on and if your skill is that bad with it, then I dont see smurfing as that big a deal"
DotA2,"Just spent over an hour writing and formatting this. OP I hope this helps.   Despite the draft clearly being a little nonsensical for both sides, let me offer some advice in the form of a couple tweaks that would have made the main idea of your draft viable.   1) Spec, CM, and CW don't accomplish too much.     Spectre is a highly defensive carry. She needs to be turtled pretty hard for the first 10-15 minutes to ensure that she gets at least decent farm, as she is incredibly item dependent. When you want to pick a specter, you want a defensive trilane that can keep spectre alive and able to farm as freely as possible, as well as possible. Good defensive supports include SD, jakiro, KOTL, nyx, and lion, amongst others. Notice the trend of long range spells that can hit multiple heroes. These are useful for keeping your carry safe while also maintaining a safe distance themselves.     CM is super vulnerable in that lane, and would likely be consistent food for a good team. She is also better geared towards offense, with a very long duration slow as well as a decent freeze that not only stuns but maintains sight of invis units.     CW is very level dependent, and somewhat farm dependent. A support role for him, especially in a defensive trilane that won't be producing kill and assist gold to supplement him, will make him pretty useless in the early game. CW is best with a good amount of early experience and a little farm to initiate, disrupt teamfights, catch free kills on their way out, and tank effectively and early on. In a trilane, he has some offensive potential with cogs, especially paired with something like SD or rubick. Using him to isolate single targets away from help often yields easy kills.       Conclusion  If you want spectre, CM isn't awful, as in the mid game CM finding a lone support can easily turn into a quick pickoff for spec using haunt. To make it that far successfully, replace the clockwork with something more defensive, I'll say KOTL. This way, KOTL can charge a nuke while CM slows/freezes some enemies, ensuring 1 or more gets nuked for what can be half their HP when everyone is level 3. Spectre can then hunt down kills with dagger, or farm while throwing harassment daggers using the mana pool that is KOTL. If you're against a solo offlaner, maybe replace CW with a chen. With the offensive potential of CM, an early chen gank will all but certainly be awarded by first blood. If he ganks again/for the first time around 3:30, they may be able to take the tier 1 tower off the back of the kill.   2) The mid solo     If your warlock did fine in the offlane, I guess that's fine, but my first piece of advice would be to lane warlock solo mid. He is pretty susceptible to early ganks, as his heal over time won't be enough to keep him alive during a well-coordinated 3-man gank. He has the same problem mid, but against a trilane these ganks will come early and often, keeping him away from both experience and gold.      Conclusion  Warlock is a fine pick, but move him to mid   3) Offlane     If you want spectre, you are definitely going to want an offlane hero that can either put a lot of pressure on the enemy solo safe laner in the case of an aggresive trilane, or contest the lane enough to warrant their constant attention. If you choose a hero that has no pushing or killing potential early on, the enemy can plop down a semi-carry farmer to soak up what is going to be comparable, if not better than, solo mid farm and experience. You do  not  want this. If you choose a jungler, nothing good can happen. They will either push the lane super hard early, to get a map control advantage along with a gold advantage which will give them a passive headstart in keeping spectre down. In the other case, they leave a very hard farmer up there to get 100% freefarm while pressuring your spectre lane.      Conclusion  You need someone who has some means of pressuring their hero enough to harass them out of lane, kill them, or take towers early. Move that CW from the trilane up to the offlane. He will beat almost any melee hero in a 1v1 matchup, eliminating almost all of what I consider the hardest carries in the game (AM, PL, Alch, void, spec, tiny, gyro being the only one left due to range). This will force them to take resources away from your safe lane, giving spectre the room she needs to farm.   4) The Replacement for Drow     Drow offers little to your team. The silence is nice, her damage (when left unhindered) is great, but other than that, she has no synergy with her team. Someone with a blink dagger and bkb would be hindered only by the warlock ult (really short stun) in their slaughter of drow. If we're assuming spectre has good farm, it's fair to say the enemy carry has good farm as well, and a solo drow, when facing a strong laning opponent, probably loses that lane. This results in her being not much more than a glass machine gun, not even a cannon. The enemy carry will get to her during magic immunity and kill her instantly. In addition, drow's aura only benefits ranged heroes. She may be effective on an all range team, or at least a team with a couple of ranged heroes that include the hard carry.      Conclusion  With CW, warlock, CM, and spec, there is excellent AOE and mid-late game teamfight potential. The main thing lacking is another support, and maybe some more disable to help spectre find kills.  Throw in a sand king! Defensively, when spectre gets jumped y their trilane, he can likely line up a 2 man stun, especially with CM's freeze. In addition, if someone is caught behind their retreating team, CM and SK could easily secure a kill for the spectre. Lastly, sandking is highly likely to be able to blink into a team, stun at least 2 heroes, and cast his ult for a sweet epicenter. How? Because warlock ult following that burrowstrike will certainly give him enough time to channel. Any pushing the enemy may do will be very difficult in the mid-late game, as an epicenter followed by a rock golem, fatal bonds, freezing field, and 6 spectres running around would make any enemy wary of overextending or grouping too much to push."
DotA2,"The in-game guides aren't fucked because they have battlefury in the list, they just don't explain why its there. It's not there as a farming steroid like it is for pretty much every other hero, bfury on tusk works a lot like how you would use bfury on a kunkka. I've had quite a bit of success actually building Phase -> defensiveish item ->bfury. What it does is work really well with trapping more than one person into shards and then ulting 1 of them (spreads the dmg).   That being said I've moved completely away from building it as there are obviously more effective options that I've come to find. 1 would be the super ganking build which is phase into sblade into deso.   Personally I absolutely love building armlett on him, increases your crit damage by a pretty big margin if you turn it on before ulting and if you're good at toggling gives you a pretty crazy amount of survivability for the price. Also if I'm not mistaken its one of if not the most cost effective regen items in the game.   Tusk should be laned mid. He's a situational pick. Playing him as a 4 just doesn't work in my mind because he needs some key early items to be able to do as much damage as possible and more importantly he needs levels. If you're playing against a dual lane and not a trilane or dual + jungler you could probably solo lane and just soak xp while last hitting with shards which would make him a semi-viable off-laner.   If your plan is to use him as a serious team vs team cm I'd say he shouldn't be played anywhere other than mid. He's played mid against ranged heros alot like magnus is. Last hit when u can, use shards to last hit with and harrass and MAKE SURE YOU GET RUNES. Most traditional mids will die the second you hit 6. He's one of my favorite nontraditional counter to squishy mids like sf, puck, storm, etc. A couple shards, snowball and ult and bam dead.   As far as building him for late game you really shouldn't be focused on the late game. Your goal is to cause absolute chaos ganking all over the map. You should NOT EVER be farming (unless you got shat on in lane for some reason and are super behind). Farm heroes, not gold. Phase is pretty much the only boot choice for him imo, after phase I would choose 1 of 3 items: armlett, sblade or drums. Once I finished that second item I would move into armor reduction and ways to boost my ults dmg: deso, ac, bkb if I'm getting ridiculously disabled. Sange & yasha isn't terrible on him, I also like to build OoV however when midding it slows down bottle buying it right away and sometimes I just don't bother geting it. Skadi is pretty amazing on him as well. If I'm really far ahead after finishing my 2nd item (item after boots) I'll build bfury.   Seriously though I can't stress it enough. Don't concern yourself too much with being relevant beyond the mid-game. It's just not your job. Hit shards and disrupt their team fight and you're doing fine. At that stage in the game it's your carries job to be farmed enough that he can steamroll the other team. Just remember that shards is incredibly undervalued and can really disrupt the opposing teams teamfight.   Oh and medallion is another great early game option after you finish boots before the 1 of 3 items I mentioned earlier."
DotA2,"I played a game a while ago and went vlads first item to accelerate my farm and allow me to stay in jungle. we were getting ownd pretty hard but the rat dota with vlads gave me some early towers that allowed me to eventuallly split push and trade raxes. We won the game despite being far behind and losing every lane. I rediscovered my respect for this amazing pushing 1 man army."
DotA2,"If you got your head out of your ass for a second and actually watched a couple of games you might realise that:     DK went 18-0 when they first formed. That showed what kind of synergy the team naturally has and what they can accomplish when they're comfortable with a patch.     See their results from Saturday in the G-League. They just beat VG, a team fresh from from defeating Fnatic, Na'Vi, Alliance, LGD and iG in the last couple of weeks. They also defeated Speed Gaming, who are fresh from their victory at MLG Columbus and are performing excellently in scrims (see xaio8's tweet about them)       They have shown the capability to perform and recent form as well. They are a world-class team."
DotA2,"hardly conclusive of anything   the enemy team had a meepo so of course you'd get battlefury   and even then, showing a screenshot proves nothing, especially when the game is so lopsided. i could show a screenshot of a kotl with dagon 5 one shotting the enemy team, and it proves nothing"
DotA2,"gave this game a quick watch, was disappointed. very passive play from both sides, especially the Veno and Clock. AM could have gotten easy kill in lane if he checked Clock's mana, or if Veno just walked up and Gale'd him. Mirana also hit 0 arrows in the 15 minutes i watched. 600 last hits is still impressive tho"
DotA2,"I always get shouted at to gank in lvl 4-6 no matter who I麓m midding with, good to know theres a difference.   Though being a succesful mid player ALSO requires you to have very good map awarness. Irrespective of who you are playing mid, wards are a MUST (I usually just grab a set while I head to lane, as the 150 in gold pays off very quickly). Keep an eye open on all lanes at all times.   If one of your lanes has a nuke heavy line up, there is a strong chance that EVEN by level 3 or 4, the enemy lane MIGHT be pushed and with two low hp heroes a little out of position. A good haste or DD gank can really turn things around.   A lot of people who play say...an OD mid have this concept of, "I am OD, I need farm, I do not gank till level 12". It is wrong, there is no hard and set rule AGAINST ganking.   One thing though, gank ONLY if you are certain of at least one kill, as otherwise that is time spent away from the lane without any benefit.   To give you an example, was a mid solo NS against a Puj last night. Had rune wards (as well as giving me vision on potential puj hook spots). Got a DD rune level 4 (not yet night), went bot as the enemy had a low HP Tuskar and a medium HP Rylai while my team had a Venge (with mana for one stun) and a Tiny.   First blood AND double kill.   The next game, same NS mid solo, went top for a gank - botched it up, lost the kill, got away with barely 100 hp (so had to go back to fountain to regen), by this time the enemy QoP had 2/2.5 levels on me, and promptly killed me. Kind of recovered, but botched up another bot gank (their Shadow Shaman got away with some 50 hp), fell behind one more level.   Only reason we won the game was a carry AM and a semi support / carry alche who carried the game for us."
DotA2,"After two rapiers, you would prefer Daed. After that, it's probably DR again.   Edit: THE MATH   Crit increases your DPS by an average of 35% (0.25 * 1.4 = 0.35)   300 < (0.35X) + 81   219 < 0.35X   X > 625.71 (approximate)   Basically Daedalus gives you greater DPS when you have more than ~625 damage. The vast majority of the time, you would not be able to achieve this without two rapiers.   EDIT 2:   Wait I just realized this was the stupidest thing ever said in the history of the world. After two Rapiers and Daed, a third Rapier would obviously be a terrible choice, not only because you can drop DR's, but also because 55 IAS (the amount AC gives you) increases your DPS by 55%, assuming you have no other IAS items. This means that  even before Armour reduction  (which I don't want to calculate because that would require quadratic  equations with big numbers that make me cry because I'm dumb), AC is a much better choice than Rapier now that you have like ~926 damage. Mjoll, which gives even more IAS, would also be a superior choice. AC is also superior to Daed after those first two Rapiers."
DotA2,"Yeah. Knowledge isn't really a good delineator of MMR tiers. Skill/execution/decision making are what separates the tiers more than anything. I mean, I am average at best (~3000 solo MMR), but I' have a great memory. So, sometimes I mentally correct 5k MMR streamers that I'm watching (on knowledge stuff: item costs, damage, cooldowns, spell interaction). But they'd still destroy me."
DotA2,"Slark is just too hard to kill.   His ulti is basically a free cheese if used correctly, he steals stats so it's extremely hard to just manmode him, he purges dust and gets ms when out of sight range so get an SB and you can't be killed, and pounce is just the icing on the survivability cake.   However, all ya gotta do it counter him. AA mercilessly destroys him, focusing him down using a hard disable like Fiends or Roar is great, obviously you can just doom him, etc. Hard lock down in lane and don't let him snowball, run tankier supports than usual or supports with escapes, and you'll be fine."
DotA2,"I see a huge problem with this system though. The size of  a percentile isn't taken into account very much. With this I mean that near 3.5k is where most of the people is concentrated, as the study posted yesterday showed, and there are very big differences in skill between people with the same rating. That problem isn't present in other brackets, as +25 MMR really marks a bigger difference between players. In my case I'm just right there, at 3.5k, and in my calibration matches I've played with and against good players, but I also lost one of my calibration matches with a very bad line up in our team that leaded us to an Ursa going mid (he called it since the beggining though) against invoker. He still got a flawless 0-13-0, and a flawless -calibration for my solo performance..."
DotA2,"Easiest way to improve your MMR would be to realise you had problems early in the game, like a walking courier well past the 10 min mark, and rectified them then. Buy wards if you need to, and point out that wards need to be purchased. Indicate dangers to your pubmates or point out runes."
DotA2,"I feel similar, when I was getting my MMR ranking for solo play, I didn't have a single game where my teammates stayed till the end. Every single game I played had an abandon, and I got placed low 2k MMR. Obviously lost every match. Since ive gottten it up to mid 3k, but it took a lot of work. This low MMR trench is sometimes true, I find the lower the MMR the more likely my team is to either throw or just abandon. Your best bet is to stick to it, play heroes that can either dominate solo (slark, prophet, etc) or a good support hero (WD, CM, Visage (if you have good micro skills)). Once you get higher up and can actually create solid team compositions, its best to play whatever role is missing. I found low 2k rank was full of 3 mid heroes and a hard carry, leaving me most often as the only support. Team composition knowledge is very limited at low levels, so try to play whatever is needed. Another (last) tip is to try to jungle. Often I found my lanes were.... well complete shit to be honest. Very agressive players who end up feeding, etc. If I was left to my own devices for 15 mins as prophet in the jungle, I could come out with a necro 3, midas, and just fuck all their towers nearly instantly, giving my whole team a gold bonus.   Sorry for the wall of text."
DotA2,"Arcanes->Force Staff will be good in practically every game.  Force Staff lets you initiate, or escape if you get jumped.  Getting an early Sage's Mask then making it into a Eul's after Force wouldn't be bad (that's what I tend to do on WR), but it might be better to skip Eul's and go straight for Scythe."
DotA2,"This is not a business model, its a market.   This is what capitalism is good for, tournaments who over extend and over reach too much, will lose support.   You say there are too many big tournaments, but why care? Watch the tournaments that you want to watch, and let the other ones fail, put your money where you think the best production is being done and attract more sponsors, and let the other tournaments drop in to the medium category, same for the pros (which you can't really compare to boxing yet), there just isn't enough money to start rejecting tournaments so often.   I have faith in the capitalist approach, we don't need regulation, just sometime for everything to stabilise in this new market."
DotA2,"Really? You like them that much? Is most of the reason you like them because they're (primarily) American? Just out of curiosity... I'm American myself.   Not trying to hate on them as a team, but I really can't stand rtz. Every time I see interviews with him (especially casual ones) he seems like such an arrogant prick. I think that follows him into his play as well. It's not like I've watched every single game he plays, but it appears  to me  that when things aren't going well for EG, or he is having a bad game, he gets caught out way more than he should, farming alone, just because he gets greedy and careless. I see that as arrogant and as disrespectful towards his own team. Basically every other top player with a core roles tends to be much more careful, especially while down.   It's also my perception that he believes he is better than everyone else on his team , which ties in with the disrespect. I have no evidence at hand to substantiate this. It's just how I perceive things.   I like all the other EG players, but I don't think they're a top tier team. Of course, none of this means they  can't  (or won't) win TI4, I would just prefer to see someone I believe is more deserving to win. If they were to come out and blow everyone away, them damnit they'd deserve to win, but as of now I'm much more impressed with other top teams."
DotA2,"Because I have no life I watched the game. I just want to know what you want? Your TA had an ultra kill at like 10/12 minutes when she had the haste run and just killed them all top/jungle near the tier 2. Beyond godlike at 17 minutes. You also only died 5 times and all of them you're running at them which makes it obvious where you are.     Death 1: Pushing their tier 2 bottom and they ran at you.   Death 2: Omnislashed pushing/diving tier 2 mid.   Death 3: You were farming the enemy jungle when they have ward on their (dire) hill at half health, slark sees this due to the ward and shadow blades in to kill you with shadow blade bonus damage and pounce.   Death 4: Everyone is off map on dire vision and they have wards in their own jungle so slark assumes (correctly) someone is farming the jungle he checks the camps before finding you are radiant hard camp. Dunno why you're screaming map hack and fuck you, fuck you over and over again when its 30 minutes and you've only died 4 times but whatever.   Death 5: Slark buys his own smoke to smoke out of his base after your team takes mid and bot rax simply to get out the base and look for you after you kept insulting him in all chat, he randomly finds you in the middle of the river but was heading to the radiant jungle.     37 minutes and the ancient falls, your team is mad salty calling GG NOT WP despite winning easily 51-22 and the TA going 29-5-4 and buying a troll radiance at the end, you were ever so gracious telling slark to fuck off again.   There's no maphack, none of the deaths were suspect you barely even died and if you weren't the ancient apparition I would have thought this was someone trying to show off how pro they are as TA.   Their team completely fell apart and it was pretty much a stomp."
DotA2,"Well, if you really wanna get into a higher bracket, just learn to solo rat. It won't make you a better player overall though. Chances are whatever you gained from rat doto you'll lose when you stop rat doto, and you'll be abysmal compared to the higher bracket.   First thing first, learn to farm well, regardless of hero. After all, what do you lose by having more money? And if you're playing a carry, you'll be the buffest mofo on the field.   Second, don't blame your teammates because that takes the focus off of you. How will complaining about your teammates make you a better player? It won't. Always focus on what you could have done better. I know losing is discouraging, but you'll get better and eventually pull yourself out of the 1k bracket.   The most important thing in the game is positioning. It's hard, yes. It won't come easily to you, but positioning and map awareness go hand in hand to protect you. Just gotta practice.   Maybe you should choose one hero and learn him/her first. Like really master it and the role they fill."
DotA2,"People have already completely forgotten that this is nearly the same team that fell victim to Na'vi's fountain hooks. Add Director8 the old LGD set up man and you have the team that is poised to claim what was taken from them last year."
DotA2,"I think the format just needs to not have the entire upper bracket be played first. Play the round one games on the first day and then play through the lower bracket.   The big problem is that the upper bracket finals just don't feel like they have any stakes yet. You don't know who you'll face so you aren't scared of facing any specific team in the lower bracket finals. Even if you lose you're still only two matches away from the finals, and one of those is a rematch. At worst you'll end up in third place, which is still an extremely good result.   Another big factor here is preparation. The teams have a huge incentive to practice for their first match because it's so important. If you win your first match you're only one game away from the finals and even have a second chance. If you lose your first match you need to win three games in a row to reach the finals.   So this ends up resulting in teams not caring about the upper bracket finals that match, so they don't have to play with as much drive and they don't need to focus on practicing. This was very apparent in the games today because EG was clearly completely unprepared for Newbee, while they had very new strategies for beating DK."
DotA2,"For every one or two games I play where a 2 or 3 stack on the enemy team wrecks face, there's one or two games where a 2 or 3 stack on the enemy team tries to agressive tri-lane and ends up feeding, or one or two games where a 2 or 3 stack on my team wrecks face, or there's a 3 stack on the enemy team where one player is doing really well, but his 2 friends are clearly less skilled and have no impact in the game."
DotA2,"Phantom Assassin. She's unoriginal, she's boring to play, and she's frustrating to play against. There are at least 4 other assassins ingame already, and she doesn't really bring anything different to the table except being off the minimap but by then you practically see her anyway. She's RNG with blur and Crits and can 1 shot a support or like 3 shot a carry. Not to mention she has a slow, AND a blink. You can TP out unless she gets basher or just instagibs you. Her face is smug and annoying, and the fact that she's getting an arcana makes me mad. Honestly the arcana can barely even change much aside from her 2 spells that aren't that flashy to begin with. Maybe change the blood splat on ult but it just seems like a waste of time to me."
DotA2,"tinker is fine, he's not even that successful in pro games.  He's easy to gank and kill early. Late game as well if you catch him he falls over   He gets strong and can insta kill alot of supports late game. So can almost every carry with 1/10 the effort and 10x the survivability.   He's just good at delaying games from behind. I just dont understand why people have this obsession with nerfing him because he's popular. People like a challenge. It's not like he's simple to play. Subpar winrates in both pro and pubs. He's not Mirana who has a bigger impact on every game without needing gold yet she's everybodies most played hero that complains about other heroes.   NOW, if he's going to get nerfed it should be something along the lines of granting vision of him in trees when his spells hit enemy heroes. That way he can still farm creeps with march from the trees but if he is hitting a hero itll reveal him. Anything else would essentially cripple the hero."
DotA2,"Attitude is one of the most underrated things in any form of competitive play. People who throw shit at other players in the game are absolute bricks. Not only does it lower the rest of the team's concentration, but also morale and will to win. In other words, when you are harassing people and telling them that they are bad, you are actually making them less likely to do well, and yourself at the same time.   Mental state makes such an impact on a game it's silly, but often overlooked as it's not something you can clearly see. This game is not about how well you are doing, how well the guy with 3/9 are doing, but how the team as a whole are doing. This is where dicks start ruining and the optimists start buffing. The attitude you show towards your team can hang over every player as a buff/debuff adding or taking away 20% fail chance.   The Norwegian women's handball team had their goal keeper listen to recordings of people cheering her on. They won the olympics and folks could not stop talking about how good that goal keeper were."
DotA2,"Little bit of a misplay perhaps that could have been punished at 0:35. He started salving up when he knew the Prophet was close enough to cancel it. Didn't get punished and I guess it's a safe assumption that the prophet had fucked off rather than stick around.   However really good play immediately after, surprising the QoP with level three the exact moment that the QoP will lose the lane from there onwards.   Pretty poor play from QoP being hilariously out of position letting herself get netted pretty much means death.   Looovely 11:30 aghs timing. Pretty much perfect timing and the way he immediately utilises it to make sure he's still absorbing experience is impressive rather than immediately poofing all his injured meepos back and walking back out.   Again poor QoP positioning immediately after. And Slardar after that and then skywrath mage tries to ult all his meepos (the most he could do there was catch one meepo on the edge of the ult to do the most damage to one.   Again immediately uses the blink to great effect. Brilliant play catching the QoP out again. She's now just going to die not much she can do anymore.   3:00 making sure all meepos get DD buff by poofing them within 500 range of meepo  prime picking it up.   3:30 could have roshed earlier but I guess the DD allows him to do it quickly and safely so that the Slardar can't jump on him. Again leaving the newly spawned meepo there to continue farming.   4:20 Nice void ult but too little too late and his team isn't there to capitalise from it. Not much the void or the Slardar could do here. I guess the Slardar could have juked a little bit from the incoming net but I'm not sure whether meepo prime was in fog or not for Slardar to see the net attempt. Either way pretty unavoidable death. Nice play in Meepo making sure a meepo with Net off CD didn't get stunned other than that pretty standard.   5:00 Nice burning of the Aegis here but pretty silly to stick around. However that fight could have gone a lot differently had the Tusk not done work immediately before the Chrono.   5:30 I think almost inentional feed by Slardar there.   6:00 probing with nets and jumping on the QoP pretty standard blink meepo. Technically out of position but it hardly matters anymore. Game is lost unless meepo throws really hard. Example of QoP being dead weight in this game since level 3 meepo.   Ouch that blown up Void at 7:50."
DotA2,"You have to remember though that here in Dota everyone has access to all (107?) heroes. So rather than playing against someone who probably owns 40 champions or less you have to be able to play against a team where the only confinement of what they can pick is your bans(if you are captains mode or draft). You have to be able to play every single hero at least close to an equal skill level if you are in the pro scene. Also having played both games I think that team composition is far less important in league. Here 2 carries are never equal picks, they are all unique in what they offer and so you have to know every single one to draft and play right."
DotA2,"even if u left the game u will still have the game played in your recent games, even if u abandoned, or that the game ended in the picking phase. the only thing i noticed that could cancel a match is a server death (all players dc)"
DotA2,"Your thinking about this the wrong way. There are very few heroes that cannot mid effectively. Learn to play the mid lane and all it's intricacies and mechanics that make it easier. Rather than learn to play mid heroes.   Seriously look through the hero pool. I'd honestly say that the only hero that can't mid out of the Strength heroes is Abaddon. Agility? Antimage, Bounty Hunter(arguable), Spectre (arguable). Intelligence? Crystal Maiden."
DotA2,"DotA always requires at least 1 "true support," if you try to split up the farm 5 ways you're just going to have everyone fall behind. Even 4 is really greedy and typically not that great. Keep in mind though that in low brackets you'll very often find people randomly doing whatever they feel like doing with little regard to that.   "Tanks" aren't an actual thing in DotA, as I'm sure you can tell from some of the other replies; but you do typically have tanky heroes. Most often you'll have carries themselves tank up while also building damage, so they're decently balanced out, and some of them can and do become incredibly hard to kill as it should be.   Some carries are more commonly played as glass cannons though, maybe because getting them to become decently tanky would make them hit like kittens, maybe because they don't need to become tanky to have a high impact, given the right support. Probably the best example that comes to mind is Sniper, which you'll find A LOT in your games as a newbie. In these cases, you WANT a front line. You want 1 or more heroes who can go in and who are also decently scary to draw focus from the enemy and eat a couple of abilities so the glass cannon(s) is(are) safer. Then it's a bit of a game of positioning and effect: you need your "DPS" positioned well enough that he doesn't instantly get jumped to and blown up, and you need your front line to pose enough of a threat that reaching him once he starts killing is hard, or you just can't do it until you've gotten rid of the front line. Often you'll want decent AoE disables too, like a tidehunter, and you'll always want just disables in general. No-stun lineups have a pretty huge tendency to do horribly.   I only played like 3 games of league before getting my ass straight back to dota, so I have no idea of what place you're really coming from, but I hope what I've said is in the general ballpark.   Most importantly and concisely: in dota you will usually need a balance of everything, i.e. mobility, damage, tankiness, utility, and whatever else you want to categorise, divided in one way or another among the heroes of a team. But if the enemy team follows a strat that is weaker or stronger in a certain group of categories, you can have a higher impact and outdraft/outbuild them by doing a strat yourself that counters it. For example, if they're idiots and pick 5 heroes who do no damage, you might want to have a nice amount of squishy high-DPS'ers since you can't be punished for it."
DotA2,"Contrary to what most people say, tanks are in DotA, especially pro matches.   There's a difference between "a tank" and "being tanky". Dota utilizes the latter, having no heroes you build just so they can absorb damage for the team doing nothing else. Tankiness is secondary, thus no "tanks". Strength heroes also become more tanky than other heroes, but that's due to natural stat gain and itemization.   Bristleback is naturally tanky thanks to his passive, but you still build him mainly for doing damage.   Tidehunter need not be tanky, depending on itemization, though his passive and his anchor smash that debuffs damage does have the secondary effect of making you be cc'd less and making people do less damage. He's not played as a 'tank', he's utility thanks to ravage.   Centaur isn't a tank either, though he can become very tanky late game (as can Bristle, thanks to his passive), and is mainly burst damage and utility, in particular initiation thanks to blink dagger and his ultimate which is king for positioning."
DotA2,"Let's speculate some more 鈥?If Cloud9 had seeded to same bracket as Secret, Secret could have dropped them out of the competition in the semifinals and faced VG first time in finals.  This would have raised their team spirit even if they would have lost 2-3, but now knowing that they went 4-1 in groupstages and still placed 3rd they feel alot more disappointed."
DotA2,"Play conservatively for the first few levels. As you noticed, TB is incredibly strong at level 2 with meta and reflection.   There is nothing wrong with going for the early bottle over the wraith band. Focus on getting CS, but stay away from TB so he can't get into reflection range. You could also think about pulling the creep agro and dragging them back under your tower for some safer farm (right click on an enemy hero, and the creeps will start attacking you. You don't need to actually attack, meaning you can right-click any visible hero on the map. As soon as you click, the creeps will move to attack you. Run back towards your tower, and after a few seconds they will lose the agro. Rinse and repeat until they are under your tower).   Once you get your bottle and get level 2 raze, you can start to bully TB out of the lane. He has a tiny HP pool, and his sustain is pretty bad.  At 175 damage a pop, you can very quickly get him down to low HP. Don't be too eager to go in for the kill, because even at half HP he may still be able to turn around and kill you with reflection/meta. Just pop raze on him whenever he gets too close, but stay back and focus on getting cs and outfarming him. You should comfortably be able to hit 6-7 before him, especially if you can force him to go back to base with good harass, and then you can think about killing him."
DotA2,"In light of your ignorance about the state of the SEA dota scene I think I should take some time to educate you, the self-proclaimed Dota2 community veteran who doesn't give a damn about this "messed up community" and apparently retired from dota because of a minority of immature cunts(who may or may not be a reflection of said self-proclaimed Dota2 community veteran) yet somehow feels compelled to go on idiotic rants spouting hateful racism and erroneous generalizations for no particular reason. You complain that in your games there is that 1 "guy" that ruins the game for everyone, yet you fail to realize that chances are the other 3 members are not as memorable because they either communicated properly via mic or keyboard or remained silent throughout the match. You always remember the bad ones because of confirmation bias, existing prejudices against Pinoys, as well as your incredibly inflated ego that probably deludes you into thinking these people are so far beneath your skill level. Back to the main point, you notice 1 out of your 4 teammates but you fail to realize that chances are the other members are also Pinoy yet cause no incident. Secondly remember that because of Valve's system you will be matched with people of equal skill level. That means that in spite of trashtalking, demoralizing teammates, etc., these pinoys are still determined to be of equal skill (though in reality they are probably better as they make up for their defects, this was mentioned by Aui_2000 in one of his streams). So in summary your bigoted and incredibly racist view blinds causes you to live underneath a shadow of ignorance that ultimately cost you an incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling ARPG that could've taught you how to handle all kinds of people including the asswipes."
DotA2,"As I said, he probably made the ending for a different book than the one he had started with.   There is a reason why books like LotR or Wheel of Time make inherent sense - it's because their authors sunk decades into developing the world around the story and also because they had no fear to tear down their previous scripts if they were not 100% sure that's what they wanted. People like Paolini that released their stuff at super young age never had the time to do that, and once you have that instant success, you just become extremely pressured to present a followup asap, which makes quality control REALLY HARD. Often it takes quite some time to figure out how to fix parts that you don't like, and even longer to improve upon already good substance that just needs a little oomph. And the hardest thing is obviously... keeping the same spirit throughout the book. If you can't you get very discrepant endings like what you mentioned (although I didn't dislike the idea in general - it just didn't fit and had a Deus ex Machina character in that specific setting)."
DotA2,"After solo supporting a few games, I had a pretty hard game on earthshaker, where I never afforded blink until the end of the game (around 40 mins in) due to needing wards and detection. It was the kinda game where even though we won, I still didnt enjoy the game, and it was nice to feel appreciated. Just wanted to share."
DotA2,"but they do act different, which is all that actually matters for this discussion.   No. We live with a lot of ambiguous outcomes. If people are more sexist online than offline, it stands to reason that people are more sexist than they let on publicly. That can extend many places. For instance, if women are less respected than men in society, it stands to reason they will be hired for jobs less than they ought  to and are promoted and trusted with responsibility less than they ought to. We may understand something as "oh hey, that weird comment my boss made actually probably was sexist and not just a weird comment I shouldn't think much about, maybe that's why he hasn't trusted me with anything despite the fact that I'm the most successful person in my position."   Same thing with racism. Just look at Ferguson. We couldn't actually find concrete proof they were fucking with Black people, but most people knew it was the case. Then we got to look into their emails, yup, fucking racism every where.   People's attitudes matter. Just because someone isn't openly shouting I FUCKING HATE YOU and publicly beating you doesn't mean they aren't capable of discretely fucking with you. Knowing that our population is pretty sexist/racist/whatever is useful, it lets us know that just because we don't have laws publicly telling us "People who aren't white are just worse :)))))" we can still know there are societal factors and cultural influence still harming these communities. Just take a stroll onto that fucking redpill subreddit for a time, that'll be great for you.   > its because they slept with people to improve they're standing.   We're going to talk about GG one time here and then we're done. I will throw two links at you and explain them briefly. If you need more after that, no point.   >First of all, Grayson never reviewed Quinn鈥檚 game, Depression Quest.   >The point being, the conspiracy that鈥檚 going around about Quinn sleeping her way to a good review score is moronic, because Grayson never wrote a review.   >He began idolizing Quinn as "this perfect ethical thing..."   This article is about how the guy who started it all is a crazed stalker, and the only "crime" is that he accused his ex girlfriend of 5 months of cheating, which probably never happened. I'm not sure if you've known obsessed psycho exes before, but they're not much to be trusted.   If you can reconcile any of this and still think that there was a reason any of this should have happened or even been a thing, I honestly do not know what the fuck to tell you. Some psycho fuckboy with severe mental issues got attached to someone who broke up with him, and then he tried to rally all the mysoginists he could find to bully his ex. That's it. It was big, and still is. It reveals a sizable sexist culture capable of thinking death threats are justifiable off of hearsay from exboyfriends. That's pretty extreme, so think of the  bellcurve on that.   >Those things exists   In much lower numbers. Of course you can find someone who's loud an obnoxious for any claim. We have a big population. You CANNOT invalidate all bigotry because you can find one example of the opposite side. Just  because you managed to find one black guy who says white people are a stain on this earth does not mean we don't have a HUGE issue with racism against Black people in this country.   It's scale. We have an entire culture of misogyny. Please just talk to some women about it, this isn't some rare thing. You will be hard pressed to find a single adult woman who has not been sexually harassed at several times by men. You will be hard pressed to find a man who can remember anything like that. Women are  valued for their bodies, taught to be nice and kind. Men are valued for what they do, taught to be strong and get their way. We treat the sexes way differently, that's like the definition of sexism.   >Finally, that tumblr link IS bs because it cherry picks assholes.   It sure is a fucking lot of them lol. Like what could even make you see it? If you won't take examples of sexism as proof of sexism, what would ever possibly convince you? You will find more examples of sexism against men than women if you look. Maybe if you live on the tumblrinaction sub you won't, but really, just look around.   I do IT for a leasing company. Our female calls staff is routinely harassed for being female. I had to block a number earlier because we got 30 calls a day asking for one employee directly. Several departments have been trained on the best way to avoid advances from men. "Sorry I have a boyfriend" is the mandated best way. I could really go on. Don't even get me started on my girlfriend who does culture studies on computer based social structures. Holy shit I could have a field day."
